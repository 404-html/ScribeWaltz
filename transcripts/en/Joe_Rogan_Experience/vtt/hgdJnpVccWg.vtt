WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
A yeah and Kaolin Kaolin

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.490
oh alive.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.340
I've been listening to radio lab on the way over here and they have a new

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.920
episode out about the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.
Yeah.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.130
Holy Shit Man.
Right.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.650
Apparently they tell me if I'm right about this before you tell me more.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.470
So I want to see if I have a little knowledge right.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.380
There is an under,

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.590
like there's a very hard layer of rock that covers a large part of the earth.

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.610
Right.

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.610
And that is proof that somehow there was an asteroid that hit and it got really,

12
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:52.971
really hot and the rock got dad is a morons version of a size that they clearly

13
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:56.700
laid out by the way.

14
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:01.701
So worse than I'm also like there's a rock that got melted under the ground.

15
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.240
Undeniable evidence of the rock of from this space.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.130
Every so layer of the earth,

17
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.850
the crust of the earth is super hard because it got really hot after an asteroid

18
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.300
hit,
everybody died.
Then they found dinosaur bones in it.
Yeah Bro.

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.800
They don't believe in dinosaurs cause I'm,
you know,

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.870
I have something called the Bible at home,

21
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:23.850
but some people don't believe in dinosaurs.

22
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.140
Do you know that this flat earth folks,
dinosaurs or fake,

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.910
why is it that most flat earthers from my experience are generally super good at

24
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:37.440
like a discipline that has nothing to do with astrophysics,
like Jujitsu,

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.030
like they spent a lot of time on a mat,

26
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.210
but then they have really strong political opinions about why central banks.

27
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.720
It's think it's just a lack of real education and then you get caught up in

28
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:53.031
these youtube things that show you a secret and it's very attractive.

29
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.350
It's very attractive to look,
find out about some hidden stuff like,
oh my God,

30
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.730
I can't believe they did this to hid from us.
The fact that the earth is flat.

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.350
Jesus Christ spaces fake too,
bro.
Space is baked.

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.590
Satellites aren't real or low flying planes,
their planes.

33
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.430
There's constantly beaming down these information from the sky.

34
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.540
Satellites are not real nuclear bombs and not real.
Yeah,

35
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.050
not really just big bombs.

36
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.110
But then the problem is when you break your leg and you have to set your bone or

37
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.820
you get staff and you have to trust big Pharma to cure it,
or you use your,

38
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.040
your iPhone and it works and you're talking to somebody and that's a big one.

39
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.530
But why?
Why is that technology something you trust?

40
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.390
Your fucking iPhone has a global positioning.

41
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.650
Satellite chip in it stopped horse it,

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.600
it links up with the fucking one that's in the sky and it tells you where you

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.270
are on the map.
That's why your Google maps works.

44
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.890
Jesus fucking probably only five or six flat earthers no,
there's a lot.

45
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.880
There's thousands of them.
Well,
okay,
but that really means only five or six.

46
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.070
I think the problem with all of them is that they just got

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 1>married to the idea and then they're fighting it and if you fight it with</v>

48
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.690
someone who doesn't know what they're talking about,

49
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.040
not that I do know what I'm talking about,

50
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.310
but if you fight it with like a Sean Carroll or like a real,

51
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.440
a real scientific study,
they,

52
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.010
there's so much evidence that the earth is round and no evidence that the earth

53
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.300
is flat.
It's one of those things where it's just like,
what are you guys doing?

54
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.410
You're chasing your tail.
This is crazy.

55
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.270
Too busy holiday or youtube.
I'm too busy for bigfoot ideas.
Yeah,

56
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.370
that's definitely,
and that might have been a real thing.
It was a real animal.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.250
Yeah.
There was a real creature called Jack Handle Piss.

58
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.880
I guess it was a real animal.
It was like eight foot tall by Peto Hominid.

59
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.400
It absolutely exists.
Probably.
Yeah,
like a giant,

60
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.140
giant gorilla didn't exist.
Imagine seeing a gorilla,
right?

61
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.100
Like Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is that thing?
Six foot 600 pounds.

62
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.290
Jean Hsu,

63
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.620
huge Harry Black beast with a giant Chaston,

64
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:01.420
enormous arms and towns on his chest runs on all fours and you're like fucking

65
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.350
fangs when they fly through the air,
each other lashed crazy,

66
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.130
smash into each other and fight.
Holy Fuck Man.
If you didn't know that was real,

67
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.660
I know.
And you ran into a gorilla,
you'd be like,
and by the way,

68
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.710
they didn't know mountain gorillas were even a thing until the early 19 hundreds

69
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.060
their religion.
Yeah.

70
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.010
When was the discovery of mountain gorillas don't make the most giant chimps in

71
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:28.950
the Congo or are hybrid?
No,
they don't anymore because they have DNA.
The,

72
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.690
they're the only chimpanzee species or subspecies.

73
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.130
Cause she'd say they found the hazard crest on its skull like a gorilla.

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.220
1902 bro.
Damn.
Yeah.

75
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.840
A German explore at a captain Robert Vaughn.
Better hinge,

76
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.320
the mountain gorilla was named the Gorilla Burin g in honor of the captain and

77
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.610
fuck,
look,
I mean,
imagine that thing.
How about those?

78
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.910
That guy who was an anti poaching a agent,

79
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:02.911
he helps protect gorillas from poachers and he got them to pose standing up in a

80
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.320
selfie.
And even better,

81
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:10.000
there's video of him tickling the gorillas and the grills laughing,

82
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.790
laughing like a person in,
it's crazy.

83
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.960
So was there a a big foot?
Fuck yeah,
there was a big foot.
Yeah.

84
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.620
It was a real thing.
That's why there's so many stories about it.

85
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.940
It probably died off 100,000 years ago or something.
Right.
You know,

86
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.870
every meet or that just,
they're just vet,
not gorillas.
Gorillas are,

87
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.590
we are closer to chimpanzees than chimpanzees and gorillas.

88
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.600
Is that true?
Yeah.
Wow.
Well,
the,

89
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.470
I think it's interesting in Goma where those groups of mail chimps expand their

90
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:42.304
territory,

91
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.610
they kill other males and then just moved their women and children into the area

92
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:52.270
that they annex.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy ambitious?
They just,
as groups fall,

93
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:55.490
dat fall on the smaller tribes of,

94
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.900
of chimps and decimate them.
There's so many,
so many similarities to humans.

95
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.740
So many,
yeah.
But these,
um,
Bondo apes,
they call them.
This is the,
um,

96
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.810
the giant champ.
There's these,
they nest on the ground to like gorillas.

97
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.830
Are they as violent as they live in large communities like chimps,

98
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.970
the little blue,
the locals have two names for chimps over there.

99
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.510
They have one that they called tree beaters does the regular science chimps and

100
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:24.770
the other ones that called lion killers.
They're so big.
They've,
they've,

101
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.170
they've got videos of these things eating a leopard.
What?
Yeah,

102
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.740
they don't know if it,
yeah,
they're enormous champs.

103
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.940
So they don't know if it killed the leopard or if the leopard died and then

104
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:36.770
they're eating it.
They don't know.
But they do.

105
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.720
No one was eating a fucking leopard.

106
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.070
So you kind of think yummy kitty cat when they're standing up.

107
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.250
They're taller than me.
I'm five,
eight there,
six feet tall.
You're six feet tall.

108
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.140
So the your height,
your height,
but it chimp and a Jack Champ,

109
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.250
God was probably 200 5,300 pounds.
Well,
they say they're 400 pounds.

110
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.090
There wasn't that.
They have something I don't believe Kansas City Zoo.
No,

111
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.080
I don't believe they do.
I think they do know they have two giant chimps.

112
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.320
If you let it as big chips.
Those are just big champs.
They're huge.

113
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.670
They've had chimps that are over 200 pounds to vet some enormous chance,

114
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.020
but they've never had one of these.

115
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.860
Did they live in a very specific area of the Congo,
but they've seen them.
Yes.

116
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.720
They have video of them.
They have photographs of him.

117
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.900
You can see videos and UC camera trap photos.
There are real animal.

118
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.810
It's a big animal man.
So really big chimp.

119
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.720
That's amazing to imagine to see of the six foot chimp.
No,
no.

120
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.430
I didn't know they eat your face and your genitals.
No thanks.

121
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:33.020
Just imagine standing there.

122
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.000
You turn a corner and is a chimp as tall as you looking at you disaster.

123
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.900
Yeah.
I have to go low.
If you ever see,
you know.
No,
it doesn't matter what.

124
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.110
There was a traveling circus where they had a chimp and they would muscle it and

125
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.320
they'd have any man.

126
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.380
The biggest man that just to hold the chimp down for six seconds.

127
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.350
If you could tell our three seconds and no man has ever going to do it.

128
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.370
They just horse.
There's just 150 pound champ and you wouldn't even,

129
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.790
even if it was muzzled man,
it gets still rip your arms off.

130
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:05.340
Like what are you doing?
Yeah.
You may not have Jello.
Have you ever held it?

131
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:06.500
I've held a small one,

132
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:11.501
a baby one playing with my puppy and it was his back felt like would like

133
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.180
perfectly this is,
that's exactly [inaudible] Henderson problems.
Yes,
exactly.

134
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:19.730
Like that hasn't been he's,
he's gotta be part chimp.
Yeah.

135
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.230
But I had a two one two year old,
one once a on a fear,

136
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.600
not fear factor and use radio.
And when we're on the set,

137
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.360
the scene actually got cut out.
We never wound up using the scene,

138
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.760
but there was a guy who was like an animal trainer and he had a couple of

139
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.630
different animals with them and one was a baby chimp in diapers and this baby

140
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.440
chimp got on my back.

141
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.190
I'm beat beat on my back a couple of times and I'm was like,
what stuff?
Fuck.

142
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.470
It was like you hitting me.
I was like,
wow,
that's fucking little tiny thing.

143
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:49.280
Just wailed on me.
She,
they're so strong,
they're a little bodies,

144
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.590
just hard corded,
no neck take crazy punishing.

145
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.560
But um,
that thing in the Congo Mans,

146
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.060
it's apparently in a very difficult spot to reach.

147
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.870
It's very dangerous to go through there.
When Justin wren goes through there,

148
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.760
he has something hair raising stories about being held up at gunpoint.
You know,

149
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.120
people thought they were gonna they were gonna kill somebody.
And Yeah,

150
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.190
a lot of the people,
a lot of the,

151
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.750
apparently a lot of the sort of uh,

152
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.680
soldiers and people are committed atrocities from the,
the uh,

153
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.160
war in Rwanda.

154
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.420
What kind of waiting their bands kind of moved into the Congo and in,

155
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.020
you know,
in the jungle,
who knows who doesn't is a lot of crime.

156
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.170
Justin wren is a saint.
Yeah.
Cause he's eight wells.
He's a legitimate saint.
Yeah.

157
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.190
Really is.

158
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.800
He's gotten malaria three times visiting the Congo and building wells.

159
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.700
Unbelievable.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
He told us some amazing stories.
Heartbreaking.

160
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.760
It's amazing.
The cash APP,

161
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.400
which is one of my sponsors also sponsors fight for the forgotten to give people

162
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.280
the $5 every time someone signs up and uses the code.

163
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:03.020
Joe Rogan and they've built a their building wells right now because of that.

164
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.460
Who was the latest number?
I forget what the number was.
They sent me an updated,

165
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.170
like very early on there were,

166
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:15.060
they had built two wells and then they built a bunch more and provided water to

167
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.920
a shit ton of people down there.

168
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:21.820
I don't know the exact statistic guy who wrote moonwalking with Einstein.
Uh,

169
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.290
the houses he,
it's a book about memory and stuff.
Really Smart Guy.

170
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.710
He lived at the pygmies in the Congo for a long time.
Ah,

171
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.100
that's what Justin wren is doing.

172
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.070
It's all that and said that they smoke copious amounts of wheat.

173
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.880
At least one of the tribes they live with.
Is that the boat?
Yeah.
Joshua.

174
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:39.950
For for what a name?
Yeah,
we are four

175
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.830
and I never seen what is it,
you know,

176
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.820
these are people that truly have been almost untouched by Western civilization

177
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.330
and he's like,
well no.
I mean they die of stupid things.
Like you know,

178
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:53.840
you got an infection and you just,
you know,

179
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.470
you don't have antibiotics was a lot of bacteria and parasites and stuff to get

180
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:02.100
stomach parasites from water,
skin diseases and weird things like that.
Yeah,

181
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:06.330
the jungles,
not even if you have evolved to live in it.
It's not a very,

182
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.120
I spent enough time in the Indonesian rainforest.

183
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.570
I've never seen the bugs like that in my life.
I've never seen anything like it.

184
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.770
It's so loud.

185
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:17.730
It sounds like it takes the loudest street in Manhattan and I'm not kidding.

186
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.550
That's how loud the insects and birds and everything are,

187
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.030
and then you'd have to carry the bug.
Spray does not work.

188
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.360
Never tell you this bug spray.
You've got to carry a sulfur coil.

189
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.240
Good luck with the mosquitoes.
Bugs,
right.
They laugh at your fucking,

190
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.400
at your bug spray.
You got to carry it.

191
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.300
You have to burn a sulfur coil and you just carry it.
Hold it.
That's correct.
And

192
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.750
when you wake up and they just,
they're all over the place.
We were doing this,

193
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:46.170
I god,
I was 21.
Did they,
did they have thermo cells back then?
I don't think so.

194
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.280
Yeah.
Thermo sells a shit.
Do you ever use the thermostat?
Oh my God.

195
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:53.890
They're fucking game changer.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

196
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.250
<v 0>it's a device that has like a heating coil in it and some fuel and you ignite it</v>

197
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.390
and the,
the heating coil,

198
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:06.190
it heats up and you put this little pad across the screen and this little pad

199
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.640
has this stuff in it.
The mosquitoes hate.
It's probably terrible for you.

200
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.390
Some fun chemical,
but the chemical wafs up in the air and I'm telling you,

201
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:17.440
it creates like a 10 foot bubble around.
You were no mosquitoes.

202
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.710
Yeah.
And eat,
look,
even if it's a little bad for you,

203
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.420
maybe it's like smoking a pack of cigarettes.
Yeah.
That doesn't get fed on.

204
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.750
Yeah.
I'm not using it every day.
I wouldn't recommend using it every day.

205
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:32.890
But if it's different between like enjoy,
like if you're in a place like Alaska.

206
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.830
Exactly.
What about Edmonton up there?
Yeah.

207
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.210
You get same thing came back with like,
no,
fuck you up.

208
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.060
Those mosquitoes man.
Yeah,
they,

209
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:45.790
they're so aggressive because they're only alive for like three months,
you know,

210
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.090
so cold up there.
Nature could give a fuck about you.

211
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.600
I love people that are into nature and like,
listen man,

212
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.920
they don't even know what nature is.

213
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.360
Try to go try to raise crops in South Africa when animals,

214
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:04.060
when elephants were all everywhere and lions and leopards are now,
even now,

215
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.980
these poor villagers that they,

216
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.960
they're poor and they build these crops and they have this farm and they have

217
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:14.170
all this food for their village and then elephant's Roman 20 officers go,

218
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.930
hey man,
and that's a wrap.
Yeah,
you're not going to go
stomp on me.

219
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.620
I mean,
and then people get mad when people shoot the elephants.
It's like,
okay,

220
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.260
I get it,
but I don't know what you want here.

221
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.130
Like they have a lot of stories about elephants have this mistake in South

222
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.130
Africa.

223
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.130
There was this guy who was a farmer and he had a donkey and it was tied up and

224
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.690
the elephants came into his property and he shot guns and got him the hell away

225
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:45.724
from there.

226
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.030
And then the next day the elephants came back and stomped his fucking donkey

227
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.500
into mush.
Whoa.

228
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:58.150
Just stomped and the donkey was on a rope and they were like really gang gang,

229
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:02.470
gang.
And then of course the other neighboring farm and the elephants came,
she,

230
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.330
she laid out a bunch of food for them in the eye and they spared her her crops.

231
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:11.050
There are all these elephants have this mystique,
which is all,
by the way,

232
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.800
maybe the biggest day holds in the world.
They hate everybody,

233
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.050
but there was so nice.
I was in Thailand,
I was,
hi Alison,
sir.

234
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.080
The different African elephants,
you're not,

235
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.580
you're not taking an African elephant.

236
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:26.060
Could look most of the elephant to see was this Jamie.
Okay.
Jammies watching.

237
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.300
You're like this little buffalo just,
Oh my God.
Yeah.

238
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.130
Elephant came over and rolled it all.

239
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.440
I don't give a fuck about you trying to stab him.
He is.
Oh he does.

240
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.210
He's killing it.
He's killing a baby.
That's how,

241
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.800
that's probably a full ground buffalo.
That's just a giant elephant.

242
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.940
Whilst he's fucking up this buffalo.
So dangerous to look it up.

243
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.480
Elephant stabs and kills Buffalo.
Look at Jesus Christ.

244
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.410
Well that's why they have tusks.
Yeah,

245
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.250
<v 1>I mean that.
There it is.
It's really crazy when lions take a chance.
Wow.</v>

246
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.510
That was the other video.
I didn't pull those three elephants killing a lion.

247
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.650
That elephant just crazy as shit.
They just killed crazy.

248
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.160
What's crazy is lines.
We'll take a chance on elephants,

249
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.650
which is so nuts.

250
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.520
Did they will take a chance to try to kill an Alpha and they'll jump on their

251
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:17.540
back.
They'll try to jack him.
Well when you go to a game reserve in South Africa,

252
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.583
you can't,

253
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.610
it has to be big enough to sustain lines cause it's super expensive cause

254
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:25.040
there's just a pride of lions will eat everything.

255
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.180
You got to keep replenishing the animals because they just,

256
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.350
they're just too effective.

257
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.120
We know after that dentist shot Cecil the lion and became this international

258
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.920
outrage,
they banned the lion hunting.
And because of that,

259
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.520
people didn't want to go back and they weren't getting the money from it.

260
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.520
So they wound up euthanizing like 200 lions because they're undulate population

261
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:49.700
was getting devastated.

262
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.620
But what made me think when I heard that I was like how many lines are they

263
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.740
killing?
Like how many people are going over there to hunt lions?
It's,

264
00:15:57.741 --> 00:15:58.970
it brings him good money.

265
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.130
I mean weird is that a huge part of South Africa is part of the conservation

266
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.260
efforts or that you know,
big game you can fall,

267
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.470
you can hunt the big five or whatever they call it.
Yes,

268
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.490
that's exactly what I call it.
But it's,
but it means a lot of money.

269
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.270
It is a lot of money and it brings them a lot of money and it brings them a lot

270
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:16.160
of money for conservation and all that stuff.

271
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.640
But what a weird activity.

272
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.840
Is there an activity that's more human in that like,
oh,

273
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.870
we are so conflicted and so weird that the only way we have animals that stay

274
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:32.570
alive in this part of the world,

275
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:36.770
like whether an record populations is to set it up so you can kill him.
Yeah.

276
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.300
So what we figured out some weird loophole.
Look,
we don't want to rhino to die.

277
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.980
Hey,
we don't want to ride on a die either.

278
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.620
So let's go hit a bunch of them and we kill like one a week.
Come on.

279
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.770
And if they could get enough rhinos who they can make a case for that,

280
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:53.660
they would be doing that.
I mean,
they're doing it with lions,

281
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:55.950
are doing it with everything cause L's.

282
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.350
I mean all the different animals that you think of plains animals in Africa,

283
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:04.280
there are record numbers there.
Neil Guy,
they bring him back to Texas.

284
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.580
They're all over Texas.
Yeah.
There's so many animals there.

285
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.370
And a lot of those animals were on the verge of extinction.

286
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.290
But they're there because people kill him.
Like what a fucking he has.
No,

287
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:18.900
you're drunk.
It's weird.
The bigger issue is,
is um,

288
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.990
unbroken migratory range habitat.

289
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.830
The Masai Mara was one of the few places where they can roam for thousands of

290
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.830
miles,
but most of Africa now is broken up into,

291
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.900
I think there's an area in Cameroon or whatever,

292
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.850
but most of Africa is broken up into,
I mean,

293
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.990
in South Africa it's all basically with the exception of Kruger park,

294
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.680
it's all abandoned.
Um,
you know,

295
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.070
cattle lots and then they just,
there's money in it.

296
00:17:46.071 --> 00:17:48.710
So you buy that lot and you just stock over the animals and then you drive

297
00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:53.580
around.
They,
it's a sustainable ecosystem,
but it's you gotta yeah,

298
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.740
you gotta you still,
you do have to call the,
the,
you know,

299
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.730
elephant population and lion population when we think about Africa.

300
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.970
Right.
And when we say,
oh,
elephants are going extinct in Africa,

301
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:09.960
like Africa is so big,
it's crazy.
It's so big.

302
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.630
You've seen the map where this stuff,
all the countries inside of Africa,

303
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.200
that was so shocking to me.
I know.
Couldn't believe that.

304
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:20.220
So there could be an abundance of them in one area and none in another area.

305
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.790
It's like saying,
look,
they have a black bear problem in New Jersey,

306
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.280
which they do.
Okay.
Do that.
Yeah,
they do.

307
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.130
But that doesn't affect us here in California.

308
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.800
Like if people just started shooting black bears,
you're like,
hey man,

309
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.320
there's not that many of those.
Why are you shooting him?
You know,

310
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.070
but just a mountain lion.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
one just died,

311
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.030
a famous one just died.
I got a text from a Noah out here.
Um,
he,
uh,
eight,

312
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.190
some rat poison.
Oh Shit.
That's a real problem with rat poison man.

313
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:50.860
Rat poison doesn't just affect rats.
You know,
there's like,

314
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.490
there's secondary and my dog was tied that way.
And what it does is a rat poison,

315
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.510
I think stops you from producing vitamin K in your body,
which is,

316
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.620
which is how you clot blood.
So they just bleed internally.

317
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.760
So my dog shit load of it and they pumped his stomach,
gave him charcoal,

318
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.980
and then he had to take vitaminK supplements for a long time.
Yeah.

319
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.760
Yeah.
The people,
they poisoned the rats than things eat the rats,

320
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.740
you know?
Yeah.
And this a mountain lion,

321
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.420
a famous mountain lion collared wondering tracking number.
Yeah.

322
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.900
Rinella texted me about it and then I looked into it.
Oh you got it there.

323
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.940
What does,
which number does it say?

324
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:37.460
He is 47 [inaudible] 47 is not the one that they spotted at the not,
no,

325
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.220
this one's only three years old.
We were going to get a photo of that,
right?
Yeah,

326
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:44.400
let's do that.
Oh yeah.
We tracked it down.
Yeah.

327
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.200
What happened is expensive.
You know,
let's,
let's do that.

328
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.040
Let me know after the,
well,
which one you want an artist's proof,

329
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:55.740
whatever and we've gotten,
yeah,
that detail of it or whatever.
Yeah,

330
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:58.290
because that one photo that they caught of it,

331
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.590
if you seen that photo of the lion with the Hollywood sign behind it.
No,

332
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.450
it's amazing.
It's one of the best.
It's an,
again,

333
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.950
it's so fucking human cause this line has a collar on it like it's got bling on

334
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.960
stand in front of the Hollywood sign and it's as big as fuck is all that.

335
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.100
It's like 150 O'Malley.
Right.
Ah,
that's amazing.

336
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.080
That photo that looks stage looked staged.
By the way.
I look at the,

337
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.680
look at the muscles.
It's forearms.
Yeah.
That's a ridiculous animal.

338
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.450
That's one thing that people don't,

339
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.050
I don't think you've realized like that's not a spelt thing.
Like a house.

340
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:33.800
That's a lion,
sir.
They have enormous forearm.
Yeah.

341
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.520
It's a lion that ways bring down an elk.
I bet that's 130 pounds.
Yeah.

342
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:41.910
Maybe 150 I think about big.
That is,
that doesn't seem big,

343
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:46.690
but you see a rottweiler,
a police dog or 90 pounds.

344
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.020
Good luck.
Yeah,

345
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 0>good luck.
That's an add.
Add another 60 pounds.
40 pounds of,</v>

346
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.060
that's a big animal,
man.
Yeah.

347
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.510
Such a big animal and they're just wandering around our neighborhoods.

348
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.150
Factive killers.

349
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.890
If I having a guy come on who's a mountain lion biologist at it,

350
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.490
depending on Canyon.
Oh really?
Yeah,

351
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:09.880
and I might actually go and trap one with him.
How many?

352
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.390
How many do they think there are quite a few.

353
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.930
This one like one 50 wow.
Dale,
when the died.
Wow.

354
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.660
Hundred and 50 is a big cat.
Jesus,
clearly three years old.

355
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.670
Jesus Christ.
Three years old.
He was 150 pounds.
Just living on deer.
Yeah.

356
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.770
Go look around for deer in California.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Yeah.

357
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.420
They know deer out here.
There's so few deer.

358
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.630
If you're a deer hunter in California,
your sad face all year round,

359
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.530
you're not looking forward to it.
And Yeah,
I see a lot of here in Topanga.
Yeah.

360
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:46.170
You see all,
they're drawn to me.
Oh,
I feed them.
Are you um,

361
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.620
it's my alpha energy.
They feel safe with me.
But is,
did you,

362
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.060
do you have a connection with them,
do you think?
To be honest with you,

363
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.640
I run with them.
Have you always been like this?
They flanked me.

364
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:57.790
They would never go past me.
They flagged pain.
When I do my foot and open field,

365
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:01.700
they surround me and they bow.
And until I released them and I go,

366
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.050
this is my favorite.

367
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.200
People that think that they have some sort of special couch k dog.

368
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.800
My friend's girlfriend,
we're all sitting around.
My friend's girlfriend Shao hot,

369
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.390
so hot is one of those.
Go in a sec.
We're sitting there and she goes,
and I was,

370
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.450
I was meditating and I saw a deer and it looked at me and 50 or gave me love.

371
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.980
Well,
I'm just looking at her.
I was a young,
amazing,
she's so hot.

372
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.350
She's so,
she's such an estrogen.
And my buddy,

373
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.200
of course,
you know you had this sort and can't let it go.
Let it go.

374
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.460
Let her have her thing.
My buddy goes,
why

375
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.080
that shit to me.
Explain y'all biological.
Well,
you know what,

376
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:49.600
you're close minded and you're on intuitive.
I'm really intuitive.

377
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:53.260
And it became that intuitive.
My favorite thing,
I love that shit.

378
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:56.470
But those people that claim they have some special connection with animals,

379
00:22:56.471 --> 00:23:00.750
like animals just recognize I am,
they know my name,
know,

380
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.820
kind of schooled me,
Megan Fox.
I was doing a movie with her and,

381
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.030
and I assume she started talking about signs and I was making fun of like

382
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.180
psychics and signs and Megan goes,
well,
um,

383
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.840
maybe you ever think that maybe you're a little close minded.
And I go,
nope,

384
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.810
not scientific minded.
And no,
I'm not.
And I think all psychics are liars.

385
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:23.890
And I think astrology is bullshit.

386
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.280
But then like Megan literally went into her knowledge of science and geology and

387
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:35.410
everything else and I was like,
oh,
you're a fucking,
oh wait,

388
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.550
you're really hot intellectual and you know a shit load it and I made a judgment

389
00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:41.770
on you.
It was very,
it was actually embarrassing isn't it?

390
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:46.220
And interestingly you would automatically make a judgment on who's hot.
Like ah,

391
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:49.550
your lives have an easy as fuck.
And she's not like that.

392
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:52.700
Like a judgment that you would make on the son of a rich man.

393
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.150
Like if someone correct grew up in is in the family business and his father was

394
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:01.820
a very successful man but he's taking over the family business,

395
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:05.910
he would assume this guy's a bitch.
Yup.
Right.
Yup.
Most of the time,
most of your,

396
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.290
you're wrong so often that it's such a bad debt.
Yeah.

397
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.210
Cause like if a great,
if a great man has a son,
yeah.

398
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.550
Most likely he's going to teach that sons cool shit and the sun's going to have

399
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:20.210
to like live up to a certain standard.
Right.
Well that was the thing with Megan.

400
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.400
I would notice after I had that interaction with her,

401
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.430
I've known her a little bit cause I know her husband really well.
And then uh,

402
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.190
and then I notice that every time we wouldn't be shooting,

403
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.950
she'd be reading a book of substance.

404
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.710
Like that's what she does when she's not on set.
So I was like,

405
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.160
well what are you doing?
You're,
you're,
you're laying an iPhone next to your head.

406
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.821
What am I doing?

407
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:40.370
Their iPhone next to the other side of your head and you have these weird

408
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:43.550
conversations.
That's my favorite thing you did.
I got to start doing that again.

409
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.470
Do it.
Those are so funny,
man.
I do that.

410
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:48.680
Or I talked to the stunt men and ask them like how much they can bench.

411
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.930
You'll know what you're a navy seal.
So when you shoot,

412
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.160
the problem with that is invariably ends up someone pulling out mats.

413
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.400
And then he started,
you started a little one.
I had Paulie Malignaggi,

414
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.570
he was at my gym and then he kind of knew,
he goes,
wait a minute,

415
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:08.990
I just figured out what the fuck you are freaking out.

416
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.480
So I take that opportunity to ask him like I'm just asking him like some boxing

417
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:16.700
questions.
Next thing I know he's giving me a boxing lesson.

418
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.420
How fucking cool is that?
And this school,
yes,
it was three days ago.

419
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.500
He really gonna do that bare knuckle ball.
Yeah.
And he's taken it personally.

420
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.640
Yeah.
But man,
you don't want to break your hands.

421
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.370
You don't want to get your face cut up.
Cause he done fighting like boxing.

422
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.370
He's like,
he looked like he was in shape.
He was like,

423
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.570
and he was giving people pointers.
He's very,
he looks at,
he seems,

424
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.130
I listened to him a lot on showtime.
Stuff keeps cerebral is hell.

425
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:46.740
I mean he knows the game.
He's very smart guy.
He doesn't get hit a lot.
No.
Yeah.

426
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.180
Think about a boxer that can talk as well as he can.
Oh,

427
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:52.630
I'm most articulate as he is and understand.

428
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:54.970
I mean if you watch the way he fights like watches,

429
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
vice with Adrian Broner like he knew how to figure out the puzzle that's broken

430
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:04.070
his hand speed and power punching and he punches him volume.

431
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:07.580
He's always in grace.
Show me patterns,
like just basic things that I was like,

432
00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:08.270
damn,

433
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.110
I really want to see the actual sparring match between him and Connor cause all

434
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:16.970
the gifts he released his of tracking them.
I know it's a long one.
It had to be.

435
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.720
There had to be some fun moments and then I will also,

436
00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:25.430
I think apparently Pauley got off a plane and then he hadn't,

437
00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:28.210
it wasn't even really,
he wasn't even working out that much.
Then they go,

438
00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:31.830
who's going to train with them and they go,
we're going six rounds or something.

439
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.830
He just filming the film it.
Yeah,
that's it and they use it as a promo.

440
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.590
Right?
People are ruthless,
Bro.

441
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.890
The idea that they weren't going to use that is more ridiculous.

442
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:46.050
Come on,W who are you?
Do you don't understand how this business works?

443
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.940
They're promoting,
they're promoting of,
he's a Brooklyn Kid,
he's a smart guy.

444
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.660
Listen,

445
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.250
they're promoting a fight that is going to generate hundreds of millions of

446
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.640
dollars in revenue.
You think that they're going to spare your sense abilities,

447
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:05.550
they're going to spare your feelings and not show edited versions of you getting

448
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:07.690
popped.
But my problem is so the,

449
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.700
I have a problem with that all across the board because I feel like,

450
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.920
um,
when common decency,
fair play,
you know,

451
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.950
contract and ed sort of the contract,
you enter,

452
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.830
I'm coming out to help you out and what you're going to do is use me,

453
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.900
go fuck yourself.
Like it's not believing it's,
I understand.
I understand.

454
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:29.370
It's a business leave.
They paid him.

455
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.050
I'm sure they did not believe he signed paperwork over.
Well,
I'm sure they did.

456
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:37.290
But that's a sneaky move.
It's fuck yes.
And I,
and I,

457
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.440
I have a problem with general.

458
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.580
I just don't like justifying anything because it's going to be good promotion.
I,

459
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.090
I'm always uneasy.
You don't have people say,
hey man,
bad press,

460
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:52.740
but you're talking about them,
but fuck off.
I completely agree with you.

461
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.930
However,
the play devil's advocate.

462
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.920
If I'm Mr businessman mister money bags that she just went in one ear and out

463
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:00.360
the other,
I don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.990
That's a video of some shit that actually happened.
I hate the truth of you.

465
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:05.010
If you hate the truth,

466
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:07.150
I can understand why you would want to show them that video.
Right.

467
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.410
But Conor did drop him,
ironically left,
and it's going to be a great fight.

468
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.410
Conor McGregor versus Floyd Mayweather.
And ironically,

469
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:18.490
it might've been good for Pauli in terms of it creating this fight with arts.

470
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.090
I mean,
you're talking about them,

471
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.800
although I think I didn't call him on stands on his own now,
but as an announcer.

472
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.310
Yeah.
I mean he's,
he's got a real name and he's a,
he's an excellent boxer.
It's,

473
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.790
he's probably one of the better commentators in the game,
if not the best.

474
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.640
Oh yeah.
Very,
very good.
100% him and Andre Ward,

475
00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:39.430
Andrew Ward found my favorite and Roy Jones Jr for Joe's juniors.
Outstanding.

476
00:28:39.431 --> 00:28:44.310
You had a 200 word,
like brilliant,
brilliant guy.
Brilliant guy.

477
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.180
Just watching him like figure out Kovalev too.
Right?

478
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:51.860
Especially in the second fight.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
In fact,
that,
you know,

479
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.850
he dropped Covello with a body shot and you know,
Cola.

480
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.370
So they didn't give him a chance and that they just stopped the fight.
Yeah.

481
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:02.610
It didn't look like he wanted to keep going.
I felt like that way was Amir Khan.

482
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:07.350
Like if people are like,
well listen,
come here.
Con has nothing to prove.

483
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.880
He has an amazing record.

484
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:14.090
He's fighting a genius in Crawford and probably there's no shame in this.

485
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.820
He was supposed to fight,
um,
cal Brooks and he kind of went,
you know what?

486
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.070
This guy is gay.
He's time is on his side and he's going to,

487
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.880
he's kind of figured this out.
He's bigger and he's going to kidnapped.

488
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.870
He's going to hit me and maybe hurt me here.

489
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.260
I don't feel like doing this anymore.
If that was the case,

490
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:35.580
I forgive him for everything.
It's like,

491
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:38.970
I thought it was a smart decision to align them and maybe it was really hard.

492
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:42.040
He's a Hillary or the kettle and that thing is not,
but the Kell Brook

493
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.990
<v 1>fight would have actually gotten Amir Khan more money.</v>

494
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.210
It was a salad and he decided to take the fight against Crawford.

495
00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:48.910
He's a real fighter.

496
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.940
If Crawford is not the best pound for pound fighter on earth.
He's number two.

497
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.700
He's one or two.
I want to see him in or I'll Spence.

498
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.920
Well him Earl Spencer is fantastic too.

499
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:01.000
But I think the argument of pound for pound is Loma Chanko in him.

500
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.630
That's the argument that those two guys are number one.
Yeah.

501
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.160
Who Do you think is number one?
I mean I think you're talking about Crawford.

502
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:14.220
Crawford Crawford's fought enough competition.

503
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.730
Like when he fights Earl Spence and I think that Lowman Chanko has probably had

504
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.900
more fights and you can really get into this conversation cause he hasn't,

505
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.070
he has less than everybody.

506
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:31.790
But he said last year he won the world title like four fights.
I,
yeah,

507
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.410
how many fights?
It was something ridiculous like that.

508
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.610
I mean he fought a world class fighters first time out though when I saw him

509
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:44.611
fight that Jorge Amazing Mexican fighter or of that that who is the guy gloss

510
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.730
record here is 13 and one in Crawford is 35 and hour.
Wow.
Big Difference.

511
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.940
But boxing is tricky that way.
Right?
So what's,

512
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.770
what's the level of competition is they bring you up slow?
Well,

513
00:30:56.771 --> 00:31:01.060
the difference is Loma Chanko had an extensive amateur internationally,

514
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.530
but soda,
Crawford Crawford had a great amateur background to look Crawford the

515
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.930
differences Crawford's way bigger.
That's the difference.

516
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:10.270
If there were the same size would be really interesting to see what,

517
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:13.760
what happened.
But Crawford's a lot bigger than him.
He would.
Yeah.

518
00:31:13.761 --> 00:31:17.470
And it's not a good fight now it's just to watch him take Reagan down and all

519
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:21.400
these amazing fighters were gone.
Deo that had gotten deal.

520
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.110
I thought it was Reagan now.
I don't think so.

521
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:28.540
I think announcing and French's and he gained duel Regan doe if he can gun down.

522
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:33.400
Um,
but yeah,
he did.
He just metals people.
His footwork is unparalleled.

523
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.770
But Terrence Crawford men,
first of all,

524
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:39.610
he's probably the best switch hitter ever next to Marvin Hagler.

525
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.170
He might be better.
Yeah,
I mean it's hard to say.
I he gets,

526
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:47.100
he can find you a game plan for that.
So good Orthodox then.
So good south paw,

527
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.910
but to watch Lenora's I said Jorge,
the Nars,
I think it's sec fighter.

528
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.140
And to watch him,
he knocked Lowman go down.
But then again,

529
00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.330
like this guy figures you out.
He just,
he goes,

530
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:01.420
I know what you're doing now and then you're done.
Well,
so does Crawford.

531
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.300
I mean the the best.
I mean that was an interesting,
Sylvan is prime too.

532
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.570
He would just figure out your timing.
Yeah.
Figure out what you do,
how you enter,

533
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:11.050
where the gaps are,
where the holes are.
Okay.
I see how the key to the castle,

534
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.410
let's rock.
Right.
And then somewhere around the end of the first round,

535
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.460
Anderson would start switching stances on you and fucking doing some Bruce Lee

536
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:21.010
moves and the next thing you know,
he's got his foot and your face.
Yeah,

537
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:24.730
that's nice.
Figures you out.
It's exactly right.
These guys are just the,
the,

538
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:26.950
a really elite of the elite fighters.

539
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.540
They're just the best at solving the little riddle.
That is what your skills are.

540
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.500
Now.
How do you solve that riddle?
That is Khabib Nirvana.

541
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.440
This is as a different riddle because that motherfucker is not on the outside

542
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:39.680
boxing you.
And

543
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.230
<v 0>he called her a wild Connor for a while.
You know he's going to take you down.</v>

544
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.650
But what it looked like Konner for a,
it was isolating.

545
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.090
He had two hands on that wrist.

546
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:55.390
He was stopping him for a long time from closing his his hands and,

547
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.450
and that seemed kind of effective for awhile.
I mean,

548
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.910
good luck long road.

549
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:05.690
That's like saying you're running a marathon.
Hey,

550
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:10.691
you know he beat me in the marathon but for the first hundred yards I know

551
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.680
that's what it's like.
It doesn't matter because it doesn't matter.

552
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:14.240
It doesn't matter.
As a five round fight,

553
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.780
keeping me from grabbing my hands for now your hands tired yet.
Hi Forum,

554
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.490
I'm taking you down.
Take it down.

555
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.820
That guy is so relentless and the skill level and the endurance level,

556
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:30.920
he has to pursue that pace for five rounds.

557
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.890
I don't think I even appreciate it.

558
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.800
I mean I can intellectualize it and I could describe it,

559
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.940
but I think when you're in there with him,
like when,

560
00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:43.130
when he fought Edson Barboza and he had Edson Barboza up against the cage.

561
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:45.350
Come on buddy.
As mine give up.
Edson has this.
No,

562
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:49.670
that was against Michael Johnson.
Has this thousand yard stare where?

563
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.940
Where he's getting mauled.
Yeah.
It's just like,
he's like breathing.
He's like,

564
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.980
Oh fuck.
Like this is,
this is a different kind of human beings.

565
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.770
Those Russians are at this a different kind of human being.
Pakistanis,

566
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.160
so t and they grow up with fighting.
Tommy's a baby.

567
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.980
He's a sad culture.
They were,
they suffer a great deal.
That's the left.

568
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:12.800
He's like Jesus Christ.
What the fuck did I sign up for?

569
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:17.570
Skin mauled and I love,
I love Covey.
Looks like his legs.

570
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:18.470
His body looks like,

571
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:22.640
you know guys see at the pool kind of works out maybe a little.
It just doesn't,

572
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.800
it looks pretty fit.
That guy looks fit.

573
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.780
Barboza is really must go.
He was jacked man.

574
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.840
Photo of could be like making like a most muscular pose or something.
Yeah.

575
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.830
He's fucking pretty jazzed.
Not though.
He's just a freak.
No,

576
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:43.280
not compared to a lot of dudes.
Yeah,
go down there,
look at that.
You know,

577
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.114
cause he's,

578
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.160
he looks like a really strong grappler.
He

579
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.220
had is pretty good there.
Shut your,

580
00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.340
your dirty lie spilling is,
he's pretty good.
What about that one right there.

581
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.210
How about that one?
Cut The shit.
You look like that.

582
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.900
It's basically the same if I was in there it would,

583
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.520
you would call it steroids.
You are always like that.
Yeah.
I was always looked at.

584
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.870
Yeah.
I say when I first met you,
I didn't even take vitamins,

585
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:25.010
Jack Tv,
you were jacked out of your mind.

586
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.780
It was because you lifted weights.

587
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.930
Well that was when I was just getting into Jujitsu.

588
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.910
So I really started lifting weights heavy cause I was tired of getting mauled.

589
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.060
So I really got into lifting welfare.
I am weak.
I'm like,

590
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.510
cause I'm used to striking,
striking,
so different than graph,

591
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.880
different in terms of the demands and your muscles and your fatigue.
Yeah.
But,

592
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.890
and it works the other way too because I remember I hadn't done any striking at

593
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:51.560
all in like a year.
I got done none,
zero just Jujitsu.
And then,
um,

594
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.620
my friend Jamie and I started doing,
Jamie,
um,
is a,
um,

595
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.300
a trainer and we were doing this a training session and he had me hit mits too.

596
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.930
And like just hit and miss for a couple of minutes.
I was gassed out.
I was like,

597
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:08.230
how is this possible?
So we're,
I roll all the time.
I'm in good shape right now.

598
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:12.990
When you came,
we get guys who are triathletes or whatever,
they come in and uh,

599
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.570
Wayne,
the colic shout out to the great way.
Mcculloch my trainer who I love,
um,

600
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.740
I love that guy.
He's the best.
I fucking,

601
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.600
that's one of my favorite people in the world.

602
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:24.510
Like whenever I see him all is right in the world.
He's just a humble,

603
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:29.250
that silver medalist in the Olympics world champion and nobody asks him

604
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:32.280
questions in the gym.
It's like,
hey,
you had this gold mine,

605
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.350
this guy here who's beat Morales,

606
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:37.590
who fought prince not seem to the distance and nobody knows it.

607
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:41.310
And he never tells anybody.
And I'll see these guys hitting.
And I'm like,
wait,

608
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:43.410
why don't you tell them?
And he goes,
they don't ask me.
I don't,

609
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:46.620
I don't bother them.
He's just the most humble doing or like,

610
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:51.510
it drives me fucking nuts but lost.
But anyway,
we'll get like triathletes,

611
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:53.220
people who are in really good shape.
But if you,

612
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.310
if you're sparring and you're afraid to get hit,
you stop breathing.

613
00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.450
And so in three minutes,
in two minutes,
I don't care how good a shape you're in,

614
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.710
the minute you get punched once you're like,
yeah,
it took me literally,

615
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:06.990
it probably took me three years to get over that in a way.

616
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.110
Cause I have no confidence as a boxer and I shouldn't.

617
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.990
Why is getting punched in the head?
What is going on with you?

618
00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:17.340
I'm not getting punched hard.
How hard.
I mean sometimes there's a,

619
00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.150
then my buddy Chris from Boston is a giant and heal by accident.

620
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:23.700
Sometimes you need to get connected and stuff,
but now you know,

621
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:26.610
you learn how to kind of keep your hands up.
But you're getting older.

622
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.140
You worry about that.
I'm insecure bro,
but are worried about your brain rattled.

623
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.890
I was a little cloudy.
I stopped for a little while and yeah,

624
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.900
so you're getting cloudy from getting hit.
I don't know.

625
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.790
I said to Brendan and I said,
you know,
he has no time for this shit.

626
00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:42.870
He gets so mad at me.
He just goes,
you're older.
What are you doing?
Oh,

627
00:37:42.871 --> 00:37:44.760
you're getting that look like.
Yeah,
that's right.
That's what happens.

628
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:48.600
So keep that shit up,
man.
He storms off.
Yeah.
Well he,

629
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.680
he came to the realization,
you know,
he'd duck.
He ducked yet he was,
oh,

630
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:57.680
I don't know.
He was shame car went all the time.
Mark Gordon,

631
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.880
all those guys and throwing up after,

632
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:03.530
after his training sessions and he played football forever.
I'll be all right.

633
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:08.340
Yeah.
Well he quit though at the right time.

634
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.620
It's really did.
Yes he did.
I mean,
he's fun.
Yes.
He,

635
00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:14.970
he made it out at the right time.
So invested in him like,
like he's my,

636
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.420
my brother's.
So whenever he talks about CRT,
I'm like,
I'm like,
see I CTM.

637
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:21.540
Like now you're okay.
Don't worry about it because your doctor,
you're fine.

638
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.870
I promise it's not going to happen.
I don't like to think about it.
Well,

639
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:29.640
I mean he's,
he's honest.
If he wasn't doing good,
he tell you,
you know,

640
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.470
if he wasn't feeling good,
he sorry.
True.

641
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.190
I think everybody needs someone who they

642
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.050
<v 1>trust implicitly,
that they,
that can pull the cord on them and to tell them,</v>

643
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:46.000
hey man,
yeah,
you got to stop getting hit.
Yes.
And for young fighters,

644
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:49.120
man,
it is such a hard decision to make.

645
00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.490
I've talked to several guys who had to sell their fighter,

646
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.290
several trainers that have to tell their fighters to retire and it's never easy.

647
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.420
It's never easy.
And some tribal identity,

648
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.560
the fighter will leave and go with a different trainer and be successful and,

649
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.760
and the the,
you know,
and this one case,
the trainer was like,

650
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.960
I wish him well.
I mean I'm sure he can still beat guys.
That's not the problem.

651
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:16.060
The problem is he showing some obvious signs of deterioration mentally,

652
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.800
neurologically,
the way he moves,

653
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.780
the way he talks and a good a person cares about.
She was going to go,
okay,

654
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.740
we had a lot of fun.
It was a great run.
You're fine right now.

655
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:29.410
Like you can talk and we can treat whatever problems come up.

656
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.980
Apparently CBD is fantastic for that for a lot of people with brain issues.

657
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:39.190
And a lot of the inflammation issues because of trauma.

658
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.300
There's a lot of stuff they do magnetic stuff that hasn't gone.
Oh,

659
00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:47.710
did you went down to San Diego and soldiers where they put the electronics guys

660
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.270
doing that right now.
Seal Guy,

661
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
but I don't think I've ever met a fighter who's retired who doesn't still feel

662
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:58.040
like they could fight for the belt.
Oh yeah.
They all want to get,

663
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.970
even chuck Liddell,
when he did fight and the kid was like,

664
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.920
I'd like to throw my hat in there against Jon Jones.
I'm a pretty good wrestling.

665
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.600
Like he was already 48 yeah,
but you never lose that.

666
00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:12.370
Part of what makes you a great fighter and a killer is that that sort of love of

667
00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:15.460
the game.
If you ask Polly model nausea right now,
I guarantee,

668
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:18.160
I guarantee if you're like,
could you fight for a title right now?
He goes,

669
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:21.490
I thought put my hat in there.
Yeah.
Fighters like that.
Of course.

670
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.180
That's why they're,
I mean,
that's why they become successful in the first place.

671
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:27.280
If you think about how you are when you first start out,

672
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.430
even if you're like real athletic,
you're fucking terrible,

673
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.210
you know you're hitting the bag,
your,
your feet are off.
Even if you hit it hard,

674
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.450
like you're doing something wrong and you're clumsy,
you're wide open afterwards,

675
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.040
there's something that someone who's really good,

676
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:43.570
we'll expose and then eventually you learn skills and as you learned skills,

677
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:44.351
you see those holes,

678
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:47.200
you tighten all those holes up and then he become far better than you are.

679
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.860
But the only reason why you you can do that is because you think you're a bad

680
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:54.000
motherfucker from the jump,
but you hit that bag higher and you'll look here,

681
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:56.410
I'm going to fuck everybody up.
And you start believing that.

682
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.480
And then as you get skills like Jesus,
I'm glad I didn't get into a real fighter.

683
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:05.290
He's a real fighter early on because that is one of the most insidious things

684
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:08.260
that trainers do.
They'll throw their fighter to the wolves,

685
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.220
like they'll set their fighter up with some young up and coming phenom who's

686
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:16.330
just smashing people and it's hard to get them fights and they'll get this guy

687
00:41:16.331 --> 00:41:19.590
to fight them because this is a few guys that'll just fight anybody.
Oh my God.

688
00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:21.390
And they've only been doing it for like a year.

689
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.640
You're going to take that fight against it.
You just kind of 16 to know.
Oh look,

690
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:29.230
she has brothers.
When they went into the,
into Andre Ward's camp in Oakland,

691
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.500
they were banging.
Yeah.
And I'm sure from day one,
yeah,

692
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.160
cause I was talking to Nate Diaz.
I was like,
but you guys go light.
He goes,
no,

693
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.320
we'd bang.
Bang.
Yeah.

694
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.840
I talked to Joe Schilling about that the first time you ever met nick.

695
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.040
And he's like,
uh,
he's talking to Nick's friends.
Nick's like,
okay,
you got a cup,

696
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:50.300
you've got your mouth.
And then Joe said to Nixon and goes,
we fighting?
He goes,

697
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:53.360
yeah.
He goes,
all right.
Which is fine.

698
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.040
She just knew like this is going to be fighting.
This is not.
It's like,
well,

699
00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:59.970
we sparring and we fighting.
Yeah.
And they,
they want to fight it.

700
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.110
I think as you get better and better at it,

701
00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:05.780
it probably becomes addictive and she's for sure because every time I go in

702
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:09.140
there and I go,
I'm not going to spar.
But then there's somebody and then you say,

703
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:10.340
well we'll just move around,

704
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.980
but then we'll see all salt also testing each other too,
right?
Yeah.

705
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.600
Like nick is world class fighter Joe shillings,
world chance.

706
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.050
I hope boxer strikings evil still showing as evil.

707
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:27.240
He fucks people be standing next to him too.
He's also just big.
It's big,

708
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.600
long and athletic.
He's just like,
Oh God,

709
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:33.730
it's doing very well in MMA now as he really got nasty fucking ground and pound

710
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.640
his last fight man.

711
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.290
When you got a guide that that good at slashing people with elbows and,

712
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.600
and punching people and you get him on top of you,

713
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.360
the ground and pound is on another level,
you know,

714
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:48.470
because they can generate serious power in short distances like a lot of

715
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:50.840
grapplers have a hard time with like,

716
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:55.160
do you remember when cro cop got on top of consomme and opened his face up with

717
00:42:55.161 --> 00:42:58.930
an elbow and it was horrific,
but it was inside the guard.
Yeah,
but you,

718
00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:02.480
you are real good striker.
A short amount of distance.
You,

719
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.740
Brendan said that's the strongest guy he's ever felt comp.
Yeah,

720
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.860
it's strong motherfucker,
man.
Powerful.

721
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.000
Those ridiculous legs does,
does legs.

722
00:43:13.001 --> 00:43:16.730
It belongs on a fucking elephant and a fun day,
you know?
Oh,

723
00:43:16.731 --> 00:43:19.790
so going back to this asteroid impact,
I'm sorry,

724
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.890
there is a layer somewhere around 66 million years ago that indicates that the

725
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:26.920
Earth got hit by an asteroid.
That's what I mean.

726
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.770
I think it's the layers high in your radium.
I think an iridium has a,

727
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.870
it's very rare on earth,
but very common in space.

728
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:41.330
And there's a bunch of other indications that that's the time that it hit,

729
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:42.231
but what they're saying,

730
00:43:42.231 --> 00:43:46.580
the radio lab one is that the current state of understanding is that the

731
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:51.581
dinosaurs and basically most things died within the first couple of hours,

732
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.200
like all the dinosaurs,
they were all apparently their,

733
00:43:55.201 --> 00:43:59.570
their bones or their fossils are in that iridium layer a lot of times.
Right?

734
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.290
I Dunno,
maybe.
Yeah.
They found a lot of,
they find them before too.
Right?

735
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.140
They don't just don't find any after it's Carnegie's.
Yeah.

736
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.330
They think that their blood boiled in their body.

737
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:13.100
They think you've got so hot that during the few hours it got to like 700 a

738
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:16.860
thousand degrees,
1200 degrees.
It's just got insanely hot.

739
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.690
Stand up and stay in shape.
Now I gotta worry about fucking,

740
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.880
that's a fulltime job.
Raise my kids.

741
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.010
That's what we really should be thinking about.

742
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.990
Not just how bad were fucking the earth out,

743
00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:29.590
but how bad something can fuck the earth fell from the sky.
Yeah.

744
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.880
That's what we really should be attention to.

745
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.550
Instead of paying attention to so many nonsensical things that people

746
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.390
concentrate on,

747
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.530
there's a real chance that we could get hit in our lifetime with something that

748
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:44.780
ends civilization like that.
Yeah.
100% can happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

749
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.810
I had Graham Hancock on last week and we were going over his new book,
this book.

750
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.710
Um,
whereas it isn't it right here,
Jamie.
It's right there.
It's fucking,

751
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:53.940
it's excellent.

752
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.140
And Graham was talking about to call the America before.

753
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.370
It's the evidence of,
um,
civilizations in,
in the Americas,

754
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:06.690
in North America is particularly in the Amazon that they think that there was

755
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.550
millions of people live in the Amazon.

756
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.770
But when the European explorers came over here,

757
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:15.540
the game smallpox and wiped out everyone and they came back hundreds of years

758
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.750
later and there was nothing like the,
the entire civilization.

759
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.970
I feel like the 1492 there was a,

760
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:28.260
I think when the Spanish came up through the Mississippi Delta,
the same thing.

761
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.820
Yeah,
same thing.
Yeah.
They wiped out 90.

762
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.320
But like a lot of people think that the genocide of the native Americans was

763
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:38.940
just European soldiers and and people and settlers killing native Americans,

764
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:40.450
which did happen,
but it was [inaudible].

765
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:44.610
90% of them were killed by disease,

766
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.430
90% the entire population.

767
00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.640
They even had Dave and had certain government policies where they're like,

768
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.610
do you missionaries are going out there and trying to convert them to

769
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:57.630
Christianity?
You're giving them your diseases.
They knew that back then.

770
00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.570
They knew that they were like,
you're,
you're there.

771
00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:03.060
They're getting sick and they're dying of,
you know,

772
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.320
there were all of a sudden they were like,

773
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:06.660
we're getting these colds and people are dying.

774
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.790
They didn't have any resistance to that.
Crazy.

775
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.700
It does dirty Europeans with their shit.

776
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:15.960
Water shoots outside their house and fucking vermin running around.

777
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:18.990
That was war of the worlds.
Remember war of the worlds.
That movie that just,

778
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.270
how did they die?
They weren't ready for pathogens.

779
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.120
That's my whole philosophy on we all try to be tough.

780
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:28.650
One of the things about all of us as men or anybody is we hate to be vulnerable.

781
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.390
So you know,
I trained and I,
I stay in shape,
I eat well and won't last forever.

782
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.880
I don't think there's anything such thing as,

783
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:40.740
I don't think you can be really ready for a situation,

784
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.120
you know,
in a bar I guess.

785
00:46:42.121 --> 00:46:47.121
And then you get bit by a tick mean you get a flesh eating disease and you'd

786
00:46:47.691 --> 00:46:51.990
die.
Sure.
So I don't know if she has any way to get merged with yourself.

787
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:57.030
Well,
I mean you can protect yourself,
but you are ultimately very vulnerable.

788
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.550
But then this video lab,

789
00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:03.360
what was freaking me out about was that there's so many of those things floating

790
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:06.930
around the sky.
I mean this is what Graham talked about in not just this book,

791
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:10.860
but in previous books that they think that something slammed into the earth

792
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.870
somewhere in the past that ended the ice age probably wiped out a giant chunk of

793
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:20.871
the large megafauna on North America led to the almost instantaneous extinction

794
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:24.550
of so many different animals.
And so it goes,
yeah.

795
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:27.580
And so it goes and it can happen again.
That could be a super volcano.

796
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.830
There's all kinds of stuff like that.

797
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:30.550
All these fucking things and it makes you want,

798
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.110
if announced asteroid was going to hit Denver,

799
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.170
NASA was practicing that this week.

800
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.410
Damn tend to Dennis before they've had like a practice run using a bunch of the

801
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:43.150
different,
uh,
here's the practice run getting the boat go to Australia.
Exactly.

802
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.380
I have to go pee.
Go Pee.
Hold My,
you've got to go to a to talk about me being,

803
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:52.270
I'm talking about you in Miami.
Yeah.
May 9th 10th 11th at the Improv.
Yeah.

804
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:56.200
And then Orlando
promote me.
Okay.

805
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.520
Bryan County is going to be in Miami at the Improv and in Orlando.

806
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.990
If you go to Brian,
count.com it'll have all that stuff.

807
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.550
I just ran across this too on the screen on Twitter.
What happened to that?

808
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:10.384
To Ted?

809
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.560
God having an affair with a woman and her husband came home early,

810
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.560
tried to escape through the window but ended up falling on a metal beam.

811
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.890
Oh my God.
It went through his head.
How'd they get the beam off?

812
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:26.890
They had to saw the Bema probably.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

813
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.360
I just saw the pictures and what the fuck is that?
Holy Shit.

814
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.630
It's trying to find it.
Oh my God,
he's alive.

815
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.900
There's pictures of this happening in the past to Jesus Christ that got one eye

816
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:44.500
because of it.
Oh my God.
I went through his head.
Yeah,
it's weird.

817
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:49.320
What would people,
how people survive from injuries bottomy.

818
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.070
Yeah.
Yeah.
When they stopped doing those,
we haven't really talked about too much,

819
00:48:54.071 --> 00:48:55.030
but I remember looking it up.

820
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.590
It just would dig a hole right through your eye and scramble your brain at the

821
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.190
metal piece of metal

822
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.020
and they did that because you were just too annoying.

823
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.520
I don't know why these people were crazy.
They would just do it.

824
00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:09.990
They were doing them up until like 19 in the 1,910 down.

825
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.670
I'll know if it stopped like the 50s or forties the exact time,

826
00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:16.420
but what do you think they're doing now besides circumcision that people are

827
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:19.840
going to look back on like that and go,
what the fuck were they thinking?

828
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.670
What do you think they're doing now?
Um,

829
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.360
I know it's just we keep learning different strategies to fix stuff.
Yeah,

830
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:32.020
that's true.
But the,
but the lobotomies not even a strategy to fix stuff.

831
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:36.370
It's like chaos your worse though.
In some cases it must have had to have,

832
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.090
but maybe it stopped them from being super violent or something.

833
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.170
Controlling people would probably be bullets.
Bullets.

834
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.520
I mean,
I don't know.
Why do they give someone a low bottom?
He like,
what is the,

835
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:53.590
what's the chief reason for give it someone a lithotomy.
What would you guess?

836
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.850
Psychosis.
Crazy stuff.
Yeah.

837
00:49:55.851 --> 00:49:58.840
That they didn't have an answer probably for pharmaceuticals back then.

838
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:01.270
So they just said fucking scramble the brain somehow.

839
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.850
It's fucked up to me that it's still,
your brain would still work.

840
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.020
It's a neurological treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing the

841
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:11.740
connections between the brain's prefrontal cortex.
You made it too big.

842
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:18.220
You're interviewing
most of connections to and from the prefrontal cortex.

843
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.370
The anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain are severed.

844
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.040
What did they do that for Brian?
Um,

845
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.070
because when you had a personality that was when you were crazy,

846
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.410
<v 0>they would take out the part of your brain,</v>

847
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:35.411
I guess that was reactive and the gauge you essentially a personality.

848
00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:40.520
So when you were on the bottom ISED you are really kind of a normal person.

849
00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:44.870
Have you ever seen the movie Francis?
They gave her Labatt me.
Well look at this.

850
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.290
He went crazy on the bottom line.
It's a little kid.

851
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.230
They did it to a little kid.
Yeah.
Horrifying.

852
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.260
Why they do it to that little kid scramble your brain.
Terrible mind.

853
00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.530
<v 1>If I remember right,
there was one guy he was doing up to like 70 a day.</v>

854
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:05.070
<v 0>There's something like that that's free an hour.
Yeah.
That's what they,</v>

855
00:51:05.071 --> 00:51:09.210
other day long,
I think it would help you.
You know,
I'm reading,
uh,

856
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.373
this Guy David [inaudible]

857
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.710
<v 1>oh</v>

858
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.630
<v 0>shit.
But there were people who,
you know,</v>

859
00:51:15.631 --> 00:51:17.400
they had electric shock therapy and they were,

860
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:19.530
they were crazy and they would try all these things.

861
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.160
<v 1>Tonic,
schizophrenia.</v>

862
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:26.670
She says she has look at her smiling 16th months later they would try these

863
00:51:26.671 --> 00:51:31.150
things.
So before and after it.
So it worked.
The little bottom,
we were,

864
00:51:31.151 --> 00:51:34.020
she just smile and everywhere.
Yeah,
but she would smile.

865
00:51:34.021 --> 00:51:36.000
She saw a baby get run over by a car.

866
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.600
<v 0>She'd smile.
She saw her house catch on fire.
Jesus,</v>

867
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.600
the brain,
sort of like that Guy David Epstein who wrote,

868
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.950
he wrote the sports gene.
We found the fastest people in the world,

869
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.450
tiny part of Africa,
and the people that run the farthest,

870
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:54.530
which is the highlands of Kenya,
really fascinating book.

871
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.040
He's a sports illustrated writer and then he,

872
00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.320
there's a new book coming out called range and a,

873
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:04.610
it's about how when you teach a kid or when you,

874
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.280
when you learn a lot of different disciplines,

875
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.170
so if you're some of the best violinists,
some of the best athletes,
whatever,

876
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.390
they didn't specialize.
It's very,
it's,

877
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:20.270
it's probably a bad idea to specialize from a very early age with the exception

878
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:24.350
is like tiger woods.
He compares tiger was and Roger Federer.

879
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:29.600
Tiger Woods was raised to be a golfer from the agent to his dad was already

880
00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:31.190
having them.
He was watching,

881
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:35.870
having them watch how he swings and everything and Roger Federer,

882
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.460
greatest tennis player ever was playing in the music,

883
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:44.840
playing soccer at plant,
anything with a ball and didn't really get into tennis,

884
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.950
didn't really find his love of tennis until he was in his teens.

885
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.910
And a lot of musicians,
great musicians who are innovative.

886
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.100
So whether it's Duke Ellington or whatever,

887
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.160
those are great ones who make original music.

888
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.940
A lot of them are self taught and a lot of them played a lot of instruments

889
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.270
until they started to focus on that one instrument that spoke to them.

890
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:10.780
And he uses all these different examples of how how generalizing and doing a lot

891
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:15.911
of different things informs essentially informs your ability to become really

892
00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:19.610
good at one thing when you finally decided to do that.

893
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:23.630
And it's a really kind of cool because a lot of parents are specializing.

894
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.290
A lot of parents,
I can play baseball,

895
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.910
that's what we're gonna play camp and everything else.

896
00:53:26.911 --> 00:53:30.240
We're just going to practice that bad idea.
Bad idea according to this,

897
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.210
with the exception of very few skills like golf,

898
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:38.550
but everything else is you want to really expose your kid to a wide variety of

899
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:42.630
things because for whatever it does with those that you know,

900
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.450
all the neurons and stuff you,
you are,

901
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.630
you're able to get better at something when you're practicing another thing.

902
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.070
Well that makes sense to me.

903
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.800
It also makes sense to me that you'd want to get your kid exposed to a lot of

904
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:54.390
things to find out what they actually enjoy.

905
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:56.300
Cause sometimes you enjoy something and you go all,

906
00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:00.090
but I don't enjoy as much as this.
You find some new thing that's even better,

907
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.880
but I'm sure you went through things like that.
Right.
But a lot of parents,

908
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:05.020
like a lot of,
he was talking about Tiger Moms,
they'll cheat.

909
00:54:05.021 --> 00:54:05.940
They'll say you have a choice.

910
00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.400
You're playing the violin and you're playing the piano and you're not playing

911
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:10.740
any other instrument.
We're going to get better at that.
Crazy.
Yeah.

912
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:12.980
Well the problem is it doesn't,
it stifles innovation.
It.

913
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.530
You become really pedantic and good at following instructions,

914
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.530
but you're not going to be very innovative.
You'll be really technically good,

915
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:24.040
but you also want to be naughty and you wind up sacrament shit like Yo yo Ma
was,

916
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.150
he would try,
he tried a bunch of different instruments until he finally said,

917
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.580
I'm going to play this.
Yeah,
you want to be nodding.
You want to fight it.

918
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.210
You wanna fight mommy and you probably have some weird mommy porn bookmarks.

919
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:41.190
There's amazing amounts of stepmom porn.
Really.
It's all step step-mom's.
Well,

920
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:45.030
porn like mom,
your father's going to be so mad at you.

921
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.860
Well,
mom,
mom or a derivative of mom is,

922
00:54:49.861 --> 00:54:54.780
I think the second most typed in word in porn hub.

923
00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:01.850
Something to do with young,
but,
but mom is nothing.

924
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.810
Granny porn is huge in Kenya and the UK.

925
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.870
Do you know why they think because you're raised by an older lady or an older

926
00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:16.110
man,
your headmaster,
there is a position of authority and as you're exhaling to,

927
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:20.190
well as you're coming to and you're formulating your point of view of the world

928
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:25.060
and making sense,
you tend to sexualize whatever's in front of me.

929
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.970
I guess that makes sense.
You in print so,

930
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:31.830
so guilty and you know that's Kinda,
she grandma's.

931
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:35.400
I'd like to fuck what kind of world we live in and my friend's wife,

932
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.450
he catches her watching grandma porn.
Gray,
gray,
old men,

933
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.070
Bang and gals.
He's into that.
She runs the old dude.

934
00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:48.660
She didn't know old guys like,
like real old.
Your body looks like warm cheese.

935
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.100
Understand?
Why would they like that?
I don't.
It's who the fuck knows.

936
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.890
That is a weird thing though,
that you hear that some women like really old guys.

937
00:55:56.891 --> 00:56:01.020
So you don't hear that from women or from men rather.
Yeah.
What does it say?

938
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.760
The world's news photos.

939
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.880
I bet she was hot as fuck back in the 80s 100% yeah,

940
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:13.590
we're going to do listen man.
Old Hose.
They're just hosed.
It got old.

941
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.610
Look at that one.
I had a friend who was super macho,

942
00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.300
didn't show that on the screen.
Let me see you,
son of a bitch who has that some,

943
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:27.940
no,
don't,
don't.
Poor Lady.
Correct.
Grandma was ridiculous.
Fake boobs.
Yeah,

944
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.600
and my friend that my friend,
he was,
he was from would've.
Why?

945
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.970
Super Macho and he was like,

946
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:36.000
he had didn't have a lot of money and he had like he would,

947
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.330
he was kind of a Gigolo.
He was having sex with this woman because she's old.

948
00:56:40.331 --> 00:56:43.960
She's old.
I said that.
I go,
what?
She looked like when she's naked.

949
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.250
It's a disaster.
Disaster.
Hey,
can,
I can't look to her when she go.

950
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.110
So it was about the room.
I'll have to look,
you know over because yes,

951
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:57.010
it has to be no light because it's a disaster.
Why is he doing that?
He goes,

952
00:56:57.011 --> 00:57:00.940
he goes by,
you know when she looks at me,
know last,
she's young.

953
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:03.810
She's me.
I go like this,
you know?
Yeah.

954
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.120
The ice or ice didn't make me heart.

955
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:15.010
I forget this.
I was like,
well,

956
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.850
some people are really into people being really into that.
Yeah.

957
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.490
She just wants to be admired.
I,

958
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:24.270
I've known some women like that who are into dating trolls,
trolls,

959
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:27.240
because they've never had a woman like that.
And they're like,
don't fuck.

960
00:57:27.241 --> 00:57:31.580
And they're just nervous or had a friend like that to her friend was only into

961
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.070
guys that she knew she could do better.
Oh,
that's fantastic.
She wanted that.

962
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:38.590
She wanted them to worshiper.
Well,
there's that.
There's that.

963
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:44.290
Apparently there's a psychology where a lot of men will overfeed their wives and

964
00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:47.300
get them super fat so that they don't step out on them.
Oh,

965
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.170
there's a lot of this is subconscious behaviors that go on top.

966
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.680
Why are people so God damn crazy,
I don't know.
Trauma,
you know what I call young?

967
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.850
Is it the Carl Young,
uh,

968
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.000
fucking that line that says that,

969
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:03.610
which we don't work out in our subconscious.

970
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.350
We will act out as fate in our lives.
How about that?

971
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.230
Cause you will relive patterns.
You'll relive trauma.

972
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:15.010
You will relive these patterns and you'll do it on your own terms.

973
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:18.460
And you'll wonder why you keep fuck.
Why do you keep dating the same person?

974
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.410
Why do you keep falling into the same problem?

975
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.770
Why after two years is this go bad?
What?
What is that?
Well,

976
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:28.771
there's a way to actually creatively at least sit with that and observe it and

977
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.500
be aware of it.
That's what therapy does.

978
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.620
Cause you make the unconscious conscious,

979
00:58:35.621 --> 00:58:39.130
it will direct your life and you will call it fate.
What a great quote.
Wow.

980
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.130
Until you make the unconscious conscious.
Yeah.

981
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:44.300
I mean there's a lot of fucking strings pulling on.

982
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.390
You will direct your life and you will call it fate.

983
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.130
Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of

984
00:58:51.131 --> 00:58:55.640
other people.
Niches.

985
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:59.770
Idea was like,
look man,
you can add these false models of life,

986
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.850
which is a lot of times life is a bitch,
right?
And you're not going to,

987
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.470
you're not going to be able to compete or you don't want it.

988
00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:08.320
So what you'll do is you'll go,
it's okay.
Meek will inherit the earth.

989
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:13.570
That's all right.
I am the have money.
But is he happy?
Is He happy?

990
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.760
You know,
there's a lot.
We make all of us do this.

991
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:20.530
We make excuses to not live our best life.
And he was like,
Nah,
live dangerously.

992
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:22.610
And uh,
try to be the best you can be.

993
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.330
Just work your ass off and if you have to die,
if you have to take risks and die,

994
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.020
leave a good looking corpse.
Is the idea of turn your life into a fucking circus?

995
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:33.290
Do you think the meek will inherit,
inherit the earth?

996
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.960
You think if that was a prophecy that they would be talking about technologists,

997
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.350
there would be talking about like the people that run Twitter and Google and

998
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:46.250
Facebook and the Internet tech people,
which is,

999
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.480
if you think about like the amount of money that Facebook has,

1000
00:59:49.481 --> 00:59:51.740
the amount of money that youtube has.
So like these,

1001
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:56.890
these enormously influential tech companies.
Even Amazon,
right?
Yeah.

1002
00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:01.130
Like who,
who are they?
Who are they?
These are nerds.
They're nervous.

1003
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.110
They're very aggressive merits and they're very thoughtful nerds.

1004
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:07.190
They're very competitive nerds.
So I don't consider them the mic,
I think.

1005
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:11.630
I think who's the meat?
So I think the meek,
the philosophy behind that.

1006
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.310
And I and I,

1007
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:17.030
and I think the United States also works on this premise in a sense is the

1008
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:17.864
American dream.

1009
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:23.590
So what keeps the masses from rising up and taking the money from people who

1010
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:29.090
died the have nots from taking money from the haves and especially when the

1011
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:30.780
halves,
you know,
are,

1012
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:35.270
are rather slim in number in comparison to the large proportion of the

1013
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:37.820
population that has say that's $500 in the bank.
Well,

1014
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:39.110
what's great about the United States,

1015
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:42.290
what's always worked about the United States and we just,
we don't have these,

1016
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:47.470
the French revolution in this country is because the American dream is about

1017
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:52.430
potential.
There is a potential,
I may not have money now,

1018
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:56.660
but I may and I will because I know I will because I'm an optimist.

1019
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.980
I will be in the 1% eventually I got an idea,
bro.

1020
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.120
I'm telling you that's a great idea and people need that hope.

1021
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:08.030
You take that hope away,
you take the ability,

1022
01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:13.031
you take the idea that there's no way I can ever esteem out of my condition.

1023
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.790
You better be careful.
That's what that's,
that's so potential.

1024
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.190
The potential will be better.
The potential to be wealthier.

1025
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.390
That think about how all of us,
a lot of us is where as we get older,

1026
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.550
the meek will inherit the earth.
Man.

1027
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.380
I think it's an area that people that aren't creating war was probably the

1028
01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:32.790
people that were leftover.
So I take it the wacky.

1029
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:39.010
I think it's a way of getting people to at least live with the fact that I'm a

1030
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:43.760
surf.
I'm a peasant.
I have no way to steam out of my condition,

1031
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.370
but at least I have the afterlife.

1032
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.520
At least I know that if I live and I suffer well and I suffer quietly and I

1033
01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:54.890
suffer with dignity,
there will be a reward after this.

1034
01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:00.110
What is the conventional definition or the conventional meaning to that

1035
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:01.910
statement?
The meek will inherit the earth.

1036
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:06.050
Like what or how to scholars interpret that?
Well,
religious,
right,
right,
right.

1037
01:02:06.051 --> 01:02:08.810
But I mean,
how do they,
how do they interpret that?
What does,

1038
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.290
I think it was in the same van as it's harder for a camel to pass to the,

1039
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:15.410
and I have a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of heaven.
So,

1040
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:19.980
so you know that the famous story where when a Christ did you want to follow me

1041
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:20.581
to the rich guy,

1042
01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:24.450
he said give up all your money and the rich guy turn hung his head and walked

1043
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.880
away and he said,
poor guy.
It's so hard for the,

1044
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.050
for the rich to get to give up their life of privilege.
It's very difficult.

1045
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.860
Do you think Jesus was a real person?
Historically?

1046
01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:39.360
I think there was probably a rabbi named Jesus of Nazareth,
Nazareth.
That's what,

1047
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:43.290
that's what that seems to be the conclusion among a lot of historians and he was

1048
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:44.490
a radical rabbi.

1049
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:48.540
He was a radical man cause he's simplified Judaism is really what he was.

1050
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.260
He was simplifying Judaism to say,
look,
you know,

1051
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.850
you could follow the book of Leviticus and all the rituals it takes to become a

1052
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:57.390
good Jew,

1053
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.810
which is there's a certain way at a quarter a calf and there's a certain way,

1054
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:03.690
certain things you can eat and you have to bathe and you have to do all these

1055
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:05.850
rituals,
and he said,
way too complicated.

1056
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.720
We're never going to spread the word this way.
He said,
just make it simple.
Do it.

1057
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:12.570
Rabbi Hillel said in the Old Testament,

1058
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.530
do unto others as you'd have them do onto you and hold only one.

1059
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.110
God is your God fathers,

1060
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.160
so that we're all the idea of a monolithic God is that there's a,

1061
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.610
there's one father,
we're all brothers and sisters.

1062
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.670
That way we're all have the same moral worth that way.

1063
01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:34.050
I can't judge you that way.
I don't know what you're worth.
Only God does.
I Dunno.

1064
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.360
I don't know where you have,
I don't know what your value is.

1065
01:03:36.361 --> 01:03:39.600
You're a human being.
I can't quantify that.
I think.

1066
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.670
I think that's a beautiful thing.

1067
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:47.090
I think we all benefit from that religious and that Judeo Christian idea whether

1068
01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:49.710
we know it or not.
And if you want to replace that,

1069
01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:54.790
my only issue with atheists is if you want to try to replace that irrational

1070
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:58.530
idea,
that irrational idea that we're all the same moral worth.

1071
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.860
Cause you can't prove it.
But if you're mathematically or biologically,

1072
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:05.430
but what are you gonna replace that with rationality.
You want to try it?

1073
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.640
You want to,
you want to run a law society on rationality.
You can't do that.

1074
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.360
Well if that's the most dangerous idea works,

1075
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.000
it's still the most dangerous idea in the world because ethics have to be

1076
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:19.830
predicated.
There's gotta be bedrock idea in the world.

1077
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.210
Well,
cause let me give you an example.

1078
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:26.390
It's very rational mathematically to suggest that anybody who is mentally

1079
01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:30.840
handicapped is draining resources from our gifted children.

1080
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.470
And I'm telling you now in a lot of history would if we live in abundance around

1081
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:35.881
new people,

1082
01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:38.310
to take care of the people that are handicapped because abundance doesn't always

1083
01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:42.810
last.
And you can't predict the buttons and here right now,
not really.

1084
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.350
Not for a lot of people right here.
It'd be,
it'd be very easy to justify.

1085
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:48.680
If you were just prayed to the god of rationality,

1086
01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:53.280
it'd be very easy to justify it.
And people have done this in history,

1087
01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:54.900
which is what I worry about.
Sure.
Hey,

1088
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:57.600
let's get rid of all the people that are draining our resources because they're

1089
01:04:57.601 --> 01:05:00.390
not,
they're hopeless anyway.
People on breathing machines,

1090
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.780
people who are severely retarded,
whatever,
they are severely handicapped.

1091
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:07.200
They're draining resources.
I know you love him,
but listen,

1092
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.160
we need this money for over here.
You're in a hospital,
you're taking money,

1093
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.140
the very old,
the very informed.

1094
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.470
You think we need religion to keep you from taking people off?
Flexport well,

1095
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.500
I will say that I think religion and specifically the Judeo Christian ethic and

1096
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:26.520
I include Islam in that.
Um,
and by the way,
I mean Buddhism is all,

1097
01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:30.080
it talks about the sacredness of the ascension being these,

1098
01:05:30.081 --> 01:05:33.940
these religions are there because,
and I think we benefit from it.

1099
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:38.950
I think that all of them,
I mean,
where does our justice system is predicated?

1100
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.560
It's predicated on the idea that all men are created equal.

1101
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.510
Do we benefit from it?
But there's also real problems with it.
Of course,

1102
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:49.000
real problems with any ideas that'd be careful in what you understand is why you

1103
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:53.190
think you can't be replaced with logic and reason.
Because logic and reason,

1104
01:05:53.191 --> 01:05:56.740
it has pitfalls.
But you're as good as nothing logical.
Hold on.
You see,

1105
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.710
assuming their logic and reason doesn't also have compassion.

1106
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:02.710
So like you wouldn't have compassion for the people that are mentally

1107
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:07.090
handicapped.
It does.
It's too fickle.
What I'm trying to say is this,

1108
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:11.710
there's something very irrational and very religious about the idea that all men

1109
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:12.544
are created equal.

1110
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.100
Then we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.

1111
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:18.370
Right?
And you belt Herrara talks about this brilliantly and this book,

1112
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.900
which is that you cannot prove mathematically or biologically that,

1113
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.730
that the idea that all men are created equal does that sees the ends or the new

1114
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.810
sapiens is,
is real.
Right?
So,
so because we're not,
again,
Lebron James,

1115
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:35.170
if you standing next to me isn't,
we're not equal as much chocolate avatar.
Right?

1116
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.933
So,

1117
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.500
but we inherently know that our humanness,

1118
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.910
our,
uh,
Schuman se are not equal physically.

1119
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:47.200
He's a super athlete.

1120
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.500
But I'm funny or I have my own suck if he went on stage and murdered.

1121
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.020
But there are like Eddie Murphy 2.0 there are people that are better.

1122
01:06:56.170 --> 01:07:00.100
But what suck though,
if he was Lebron James and he was funnier than you,

1123
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.960
well he's not a bad actor.
I'll tell you that action.

1124
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:05.110
Imagine if he was really funny.
Like if you couldn't follow him,

1125
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.230
that's when I give him my girl.
He imagined that though I would present him with,

1126
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.270
my girl has a six foot,
what?

1127
01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:13.950
11 six nine six nine six foot,

1128
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
two 65 bill like a god faster than everybody and stronger than amazing and

1129
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.370
murders on stage at the store.

1130
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:27.230
And when you eat the mic you have to go like this to get some like bring it down

1131
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.860
to you because you have to go on after him.
And that's when I say to him,

1132
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:33.100
he's got into the mix down.
It's fucking seven feet in the air.
And I go,

1133
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:36.610
Mr Mr. James,
I'd like to be a traveling concubine.

1134
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.300
I'm probably not want that.
I'm not your type.
No.
Then you're useless.

1135
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:43.530
Take Culinary.
I'll take,
let me cook for,

1136
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.700
you know he's got people that shut the fuck up.
That carry the bag.

1137
01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:47.980
Polish your shoes too annoying man.
What are you going to do?

1138
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.480
You'll stare at his dick all day to connect.

1139
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:53.230
Ask them questions about what a man he is.
Yeah.
This is weird.
What do you squat?

1140
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.550
Leave him alone.
Okay,
I'll just be in the corn.
Write better jokes.

1141
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.740
Just sir,
I'd like to be,
that would be so embarrassing.

1142
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.490
Like if a guy was that good at basketball,

1143
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:09.390
but then it was like a natural at comedy fair,

1144
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:15.010
there are starting to murder in their nominee like,
or like a fighter.

1145
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:18.080
Like what if Terrence Crawford tell him to be the funniest fucking dude in the

1146
01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:21.520
world.
Imagine.
Imagine,
you know,
and,

1147
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.230
and he not just fucks people up in the ring,

1148
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.710
but then Terrance Crawford starts doing sets the comedy store and murdering and

1149
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:32.650
he's got a Netflix special and he's murdering and you're like,
oh,

1150
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.360
here we go.
So good at these.
I don't know man.
Yeah,
but listen,

1151
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:40.040
there are people that are better and everything sometimes.
I mean there are,

1152
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.370
well there's death look,
but Elon Musk is a good example of that.

1153
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.210
How many fucking things can that guy do at once?
But at the same time,

1154
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.900
what I'm saying is that you can't quantify human being because you don't know

1155
01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:53.240
what their potential is and you don't know where the strong like

1156
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:58.170
Lebron James Murders on stage,
he's not dead or than you.

1157
01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.790
He's better than you and everything fucking bird following you.

1158
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.710
You got to follow him.
He's gonna murder and then the king has left the building.

1159
01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:10.370
Lacey going to drop the mic and walk away and they have problems and then you

1160
01:09:10.371 --> 01:09:14.870
got to go on after.
You can't be that good at,
at two fingers.
Right.
I mean,
wow.

1161
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.733
Who says

1162
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:21.500
which do you put it like three times.

1163
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.180
Listen to me.

1164
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.880
What if he puts the kind of effort that he puts into getting good at basketball

1165
01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:30.170
and he couldn't?
Good at stand up.
Awesome.
Yeah.
One muscles,
Lazy.

1166
01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.070
One muscle doesn't really write and work and like for the amount of hours that

1167
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:38.210
we work on our craft versus about a basketball player as to practice staff rent

1168
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.880
lizard.
This is Blake Griffin.

1169
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:43.940
He's been trying to just stand up in the off season last couple of years more.

1170
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:46.500
When he was living in La,
he got traded to Detroit now,
so it's,

1171
01:09:46.501 --> 01:09:49.790
it's a little bit harder for them probably,
but not yet competent to doing good.

1172
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.910
He's good.
Yeah.
I mean from what I've heard from a few people have seen it.

1173
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:55.310
That's hilarious.
Videos of it.
There you go motherfucker.

1174
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.940
Yet so he can look at six 10 standup doesn't care.

1175
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:03.340
It's a long road in 10 years.
Can work though some if he does it.
Let's see.

1176
01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:08.370
What I'm saying is like you take a guy who has the kind of discipline and work

1177
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.540
ethic that an athlete does at a highest level of the game.
Yeah.

1178
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.100
And apply that standup comics.
I bet they'll get further than a lot of us.

1179
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.590
He's only 30 only 30 baby.

1180
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.950
What are you going to do Blake Griffin's get to a murder in front of you.

1181
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.050
Match a weird muscle standard of weird muscle.

1182
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:28.490
Joey Diaz isn't exactly like Joey Diaz.
Hi,
bye bye.
Noon.

1183
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:31.300
But he's funny as fuck.
And he's like,
he's way before noon.

1184
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.780
Comedy's a weird thing.
Comedy is a very,
there are some flops.

1185
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.530
Joey Diaz,
Mike at high all the time.
That mother fucker works on exact.

1186
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.710
Joey works and is,
it's a mindset you're always writing.
Joey Diaz is a pro.

1187
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.560
Like people see Joey and they see that,
you know,

1188
01:10:48.561 --> 01:10:53.000
he smokes a lot of weed and he's crazy and they assumed that he just gets up

1189
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:55.910
there just rants and raves.
No,
no,
no.
That guy always has new material.

1190
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:59.870
I'll always work.
Always working on something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

1191
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.510
I think that's what it takes to,
I think that,
um,

1192
01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:07.640
this kid was younger and he told me he hadn't written a joke in two years and I

1193
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:12.020
went,
well,
you're talking like a loser.
You know,
you,
you can't,

1194
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.230
I think standup,
relentless.
Especially do you develop a follow with you?

1195
01:11:15.231 --> 01:11:17.130
If that's where he's at,
he's probably depressed.

1196
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.410
There's something probably wrong with it.
We talked about that too.
Yeah,

1197
01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:25.530
but I'm saying that,
you know,
again,
you know,
depression is a very real thing,

1198
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.760
but I always send it kinda younger people who've seen like they're in a Rut.

1199
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.880
I too,
I'm a huge believer in just,

1200
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:36.990
just take the steps of getting better at one type of language.
Start.

1201
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.210
It doesn't matter if it's a guitar,
it doesn't matter.

1202
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:42.240
Just get better at one little thing.
Just start practicing.

1203
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:44.790
It'll motivate you to do other things.
I'm not saying depression.

1204
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.280
Clinical depression is a very real thing.
I don't know enough about it.
Well,

1205
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:51.500
the thing is,
it's,
it is real,
but it's different with every person.
It's like,

1206
01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:55.260
it's one of the rarest of diseases in that like you really can't put it on a

1207
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:59.520
scale.
You spectrum,
you feel like shit or you don't feel like shit,

1208
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:03.120
you're depressed or not depressed.
But what,
what level depressed are you,

1209
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.400
are you suicidal?
Are you just like kind of Shitty?

1210
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.640
Could you fix it with like running or,

1211
01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:11.190
or do you need like real chemical intervention and in,
do you know,

1212
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.210
do you know the difference?

1213
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:15.880
Like w what's your community like what are your friendships like?
Yeah,

1214
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.530
what does your family life?
She was questions,
huge questions.
And by the way,

1215
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:23.130
how are you eating?
How are you exercising?
What is your community like?

1216
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.993
These are things where the,

1217
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:28.560
and people who live the longest and the side is what does it,
Spain,
I heard,

1218
01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:29.311
and I don't know if I'm right,

1219
01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:34.230
has the longest per capital lift people right now and yet huge alcohol and

1220
01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:37.110
tobacco consumption.
But they are connected to community.

1221
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:40.990
They're there and they do a lot of that.
They getting it in,
you know,

1222
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:45.620
taking cs as long lunch thing and yes,
in it out.
Yes.

1223
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.100
Drinking red wine.

1224
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.320
Why not enjoying their life and that success and sings.
I've done.

1225
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:58.820
I bet that was this Spain to lead Japan and global life expectancy go us

1226
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:02.280
continued to slide because we're eating shitty food and we're getting fat.

1227
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:07.080
We're also isolated.
Yeah.
There's a price you paid for as a capitalist,

1228
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.540
as a capitalist,
as somebody believes in the free market,

1229
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.730
there's a price you pay for the praying to the god of consumption and progress.

1230
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.600
There is,
as we as we are,

1231
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:20.520
ruthlessly competitive Americans,

1232
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:25.110
real Americans are fucking ruthlessly competitive and insanely aggressive.

1233
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:29.940
Football is a game of war.
It's simulated work.
You're,
you're,
you're,

1234
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.900
you're capturing territory and everything else it,

1235
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.040
we are so aggressive that way and look,
it makes us a great country.

1236
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:41.310
We also pay a price for it,
no question about it.
It's like I get,

1237
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:46.670
I do get sort of the notion that we need there.

1238
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.410
There is this idea that we're the left,
a lot of the left says,
look man,
this,

1239
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:56.310
this capitalism stuff that seems to be creating isolation and depression.

1240
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.350
Like how's it going?
Is there,

1241
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:03.390
is there a conversation that we had about how we figure out how we structure our

1242
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:07.410
lives,
where community takes more of a precedence where job security,

1243
01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:11.230
it takes more of a presence,
all these things.
Well then I start to freak out.

1244
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:12.840
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

1245
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:14.550
<v 1>The,
here's the thing about socialism.</v>

1246
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.540
Socialism in general sounds like a terrible idea because a lot of people are

1247
01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:22.620
lazy and because it d incentivizes people from action and there's a certain

1248
01:14:22.621 --> 01:14:25.620
thing that people should have motivation to succeed.

1249
01:14:25.621 --> 01:14:28.260
They should have some drive and they get some satisfaction out of achieving

1250
01:14:28.261 --> 01:14:31.860
goals and those are all things that I would not want to deny any young person

1251
01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:33.150
from.
I think those,

1252
01:14:33.151 --> 01:14:35.970
those are really important things for happiness and one of the things that

1253
01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:39.030
they've,
they've studied when they've studied happiness and people,

1254
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.000
people that are goal oriented and that set,

1255
01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:43.740
they set goals and achieve those goals.

1256
01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:48.450
It's one of the best markers for happiness and it doesn't necessarily mean
money.

1257
01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.280
You know?
The problem is we like to think of it as money as it's a money thing,

1258
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:58.380
but in athletics and art,
when p it without finance attached to it at all,

1259
01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:01.500
when people set out to do something and then do it,

1260
01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.160
they achieve a sense of self worth and happiness.
And then understanding,

1261
01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:06.870
understanding of yourself,
who you are.

1262
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:10.020
This is what's missing from a lot of people.
And again,

1263
01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:13.620
I'm not a clinical psychologist.
I don't really understand depression.
I don't,

1264
01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.480
I don't suffer from it.
But I,

1265
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:20.850
I've known enough people that have to know that there's a lot of different kinds

1266
01:15:20.851 --> 01:15:23.460
of it.
It's all different.
And I think some people just have,

1267
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:25.890
they have a broken brain.
There's something wrong in there.

1268
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.760
And it would be nice if there was a chemical that could fit into that slot and

1269
01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:30.330
fix it.

1270
01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:33.690
And sometimes there is for those people and sometimes it changes their lives.

1271
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:36.770
And then I've known people that were on the wrong metrics,

1272
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:40.590
like Ari was on probation,
it was fucking with him.
It gave him depression,

1273
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.670
you know.
And sometimes people,
they'll change their diet.
And you know,

1274
01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.790
one of the things that are Rhonda Patrick was she posted something,

1275
01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:52.320
I think it was on her Twitter account and how inflammation um,

1276
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.440
led to impulsive decision making led to cheating on your diet and lead to a poor

1277
01:15:59.461 --> 01:16:03.930
decisions in terms of like overall lifestyle just from having higher levels of

1278
01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:07.080
inflammation.
So eating shitty food,
not getting enough sleep,

1279
01:16:07.081 --> 01:16:08.910
drinking all those things lead to inflammation.

1280
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:12.870
All those things cause you to make more impulsive food choices,

1281
01:16:12.871 --> 01:16:16.770
shitty food choices,
bad dietary choices,
bad lifestyle and rest choices.

1282
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.580
Like they're all,
it almost like inflammation wants more of it.
Here it is.

1283
01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.840
Study finds an inflammation even at subclinical levels in healthy participants

1284
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:29.340
may provoke impulsive behavior and an inability to delay gratification.

1285
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:30.383
Isn't that amazing?

1286
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1287
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:36.130
I start to pull back with all this stuff and I always think to myself like I

1288
01:16:36.131 --> 01:16:39.130
think I think what you and I are after,

1289
01:16:39.131 --> 01:16:44.080
like when the reason I'm happy and the reason I feel so fulfilled is I'm able to

1290
01:16:44.081 --> 01:16:48.670
express myself fully.
Like fully.
Like I told you the other day,

1291
01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:51.970
like I certain development in my life.
Like I was like,
I,

1292
01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:56.320
I want radical honesty in the sense that I don't have to lie about anything.

1293
01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.570
I don't want to lie about anything.
I want to be very honest.

1294
01:16:58.571 --> 01:17:02.530
You and I have been always been so honest with each other.
Right?
And well,

1295
01:17:02.531 --> 01:17:06.080
that's why we know each other's so.
Yes.

1296
01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:09.630
And the minute we started fucking bullshitting and you're like,
oh,
like do what?

1297
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.670
But that,

1298
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:13.310
that's where you have your friends and hold you accountable because they know

1299
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:16.850
exactly who you are.
And it's very important.
Exactly.
But that,
so,

1300
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:22.180
so what that allows you to do is to express yourself fully and completely.

1301
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:27.140
The original self expression is my home,
my credo,
my idea.
But,

1302
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:31.190
but so eating well,
if eating well,
see,

1303
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:33.770
I don't want my body to get in the way.
I don't want it to get in the way.

1304
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.920
So I investigate how to feel optimal so that I can just not have to get in the

1305
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.740
way and I can do the things I love.
Yeah.
That is a form of,

1306
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:45.670
of expressing myself fully.
I always wanted a box.
I'm so,

1307
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.630
it was such a mystery to me and I'll be,

1308
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:49.970
I'm nervous today because I've got to go spar some.
Fuck.

1309
01:17:49.971 --> 01:17:52.820
How long have you been doing it now?
How many years?
Almost five years now.
But,

1310
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:55.700
but,
but,
but I don't care about,
you know,
I'm not going to enter,
you know,

1311
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:58.810
I'm not going to,
Wayne wants me to fight.
I want you to find it,

1312
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.910
but I'm not going to do I want to,
I want to,
uh,
I don't want to be an actor.

1313
01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.370
It Taxify,

1314
01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.510
it's hilarious to me just doing that to you because he's a fighter and he's a

1315
01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:06.344
maniac.

1316
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:10.050
He couldn't get in there lace at the gloves and his one time you can fight,

1317
01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.580
you can fight.

1318
01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:16.760
So the old left right left and then I put on head gear and he just puts in a

1319
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:21.530
mouthpiece and it's just gives me up.
He puts his gloves wherever he wants,

1320
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.040
which is annoying.
But,
but my point is that I,

1321
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.530
I feel like I'm expressing myself in that vein.

1322
01:18:27.531 --> 01:18:31.190
I always wanted to do it on your shoulders.
They're like,
right pomegranates.

1323
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.710
Really?
You're okay.
I have a beautiful body and doesn't bother you at all.

1324
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.920
Boxing doesn't injure you.
It's Jujitsu and crossfit.

1325
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.000
That shit if you're not careful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm old now.
I have warm up.

1326
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.930
Boxing can definitely still injure you.
Do you,
um,
do warm up with like bands?

1327
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.710
What do you do?
You know,
I just,
you know what?
I really,
honestly,
what I do,

1328
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:53.320
I have my whole dynamic stretching routine I do in the morning when I walk into

1329
01:18:53.321 --> 01:18:58.010
the gym,
I lace them up and I just started moving very slowly.

1330
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:02.180
I warm my body up,
I start hitting them.
It's really lightly.
And as I go,

1331
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:04.820
I hit more and more and then I'm a meathead.

1332
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:08.000
I see those myths and I want to smash and that's what happens.

1333
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:10.800
That's what happens.
Then your back is happy left.

1334
01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:15.500
Did sell me to tell me don't start slow.
Start slow.
It's warm up.
Warm Up.

1335
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.670
You need Jesus.
You okay?
Yeah.
All that cocaine.
You doing coke?
Yeah,

1336
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.100
but just a little bro.
Just a little,
just for,
if you do a little,

1337
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:25.340
if you take the edge off,
nobody did.

1338
01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:29.030
And nobody ever did a bunch of cocaine and shit got better.
Well,

1339
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.220
I wonder if people chewed bunch of coca leaves and chicken and cook.

1340
01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.410
I'm hurting by try and that,
the problem is if you crash,

1341
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.710
you do blow and you want to start a business with your friend,

1342
01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.040
you all these fucking,
you microdose silicide been because there's no real crap.

1343
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:45.320
I mean there's a weird feeling after mushroom trip,

1344
01:19:45.321 --> 01:19:50.321
but there's no like devastating crash that I hear people report after a cocaine,

1345
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:55.000
cocaine.
Apparently when you on the come down you just wrecked.
That's one of the,

1346
01:19:55.050 --> 01:19:57.380
the,
the rollercoaster ride.
Like a lot of people,

1347
01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.190
they do the cocaine and then they have the crash that dopamine levels smash and

1348
01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:04.340
then they only feel good if they're doing cocaine again because their body is so

1349
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.830
fucked up.
That was why you lose your house like in three years.

1350
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.700
A buddy of mine had that in,
uh,
our other friend,
uh,

1351
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:16.100
worked in a Rehab Center and was trying to explain it to us what was wrong.
Yeah,

1352
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:20.550
it's no joke.
Who was sad,
sad shit.
I had somebody describe,

1353
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:23.790
he emailed me and he described what we were talking about.

1354
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:28.530
My friend Michael Mcdonald's best friend committed suicide and he was on the

1355
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:31.410
podcast talking about it and he's got an emotional is heavy shit.

1356
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:36.300
And I'm somebody I know comes to my shows,

1357
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:39.900
emailed me and I guess he suffers from serious depression.
And you know,

1358
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:43.980
he described the like when,
so we can always say,
well how did they,

1359
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:47.350
how could they commit suicide?
They had children.
I mean,
how,
what,
what happened?

1360
01:20:47.351 --> 01:20:49.230
Like it makes no sense.
He said,

1361
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.800
for me it's like being in a sauna and you know how you get too hot,

1362
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:58.650
you get so hot you have to get the fuck out cause you're too out.
And he said,

1363
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:03.300
only there's nowhere to go.
Ooh,
you don't have an exit.
You know,

1364
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.690
I was in the song yesterday and I've been in the sauna lately at higher

1365
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:08.970
temperatures because Gabrielle Reece,

1366
01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:13.080
she was on the podcast and she was seeing her husband,
you know,
Laird Hamilton,

1367
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:17.400
that badass surfer.
He cranks his son up to 225 degrees.

1368
01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:21.230
And when,
when people like,
he's like,
who's been fucking with my son?
And I'm like,

1369
01:21:21.231 --> 01:21:25.320
it's like it's lower that to 25 and I'm like,
Jesus Christ,
she's telling me this.

1370
01:21:25.321 --> 01:21:28.140
I'm like two 25 fucks.

1371
01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:32.100
I put the sign up to 200 yesterday and uh,

1372
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.740
I was thinking now while I'm lying there,
I'm like,

1373
01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:37.920
what if this was the world forever?

1374
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:41.520
I'll use two degrees from now on forever.
The world's 200 degrees.

1375
01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:44.670
Like how happy would you be with your children?
Could you still laugh?

1376
01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:49.530
I was thinking like I could,
I can withstand that I was standing for 20 minutes.

1377
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.910
That's what I do.
Right,

1378
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.800
but what would I do if that was like that feeling of hot,
if it didn't kill you,

1379
01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:59.130
that feeling of 200 degrees out,
would you be willing to live through that?

1380
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.110
Like how much would it sat in your life?
How much would it weigh on?
Yeah,
a lot.

1381
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.020
Of course.
What I'm trying to say is move out of Phoenix,

1382
01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:11.460
Arizona books that's so massively hot.
It's not worth in God.

1383
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:14.610
Get yourself a Colorado mountain home in the West in the summer.

1384
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:18.010
I was just up at boulder boulder.
It needs to be a little more aggressive,

1385
01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:20.470
like I was just in boulder and it just like I,

1386
01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:25.290
I see a grown man in the middle of the day with a beard balancing a hand rail.

1387
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:25.741
I'm like,

1388
01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:30.420
you're an able bodied man and it's Friday at fucking to go to work right now

1389
01:22:30.421 --> 01:22:31.254
before you know,

1390
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:34.260
there's another dudes just sitting cross legged with a small little flute.

1391
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:38.010
You know who you played in elementary school?
Just so on.

1392
01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:42.000
Aggressive male is paradise that whatever I wanted her hair that they had a sale

1393
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:46.620
on his clogs it.
A few hippies bro.
Like what did I say?
Aggressive.

1394
01:22:46.621 --> 01:22:49.830
I would percentage of those people are there because there's 100,000 people.

1395
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:54.300
It's their 10 okay.
Is there 10 people that are playing the flute?

1396
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:58.260
They put cattlein talking about white,
really white,
wealthy,

1397
01:22:58.261 --> 01:23:02.370
white people that put caffeine and and comfortable footwear at the top of their

1398
01:23:02.371 --> 01:23:06.430
essentials.
Yeah,
comfortable footwear.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know,
man.

1399
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:07.560
Beat to her.

1400
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.350
Put Up fucking put on a leather sole in your fucking foot and go to work.

1401
01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:17.170
Have your toes,
pants to hard wooden heel.
And I want,
yeah,
I like that.

1402
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:20.920
And have your toes pinch a little bit.
You saw that and where?
Some wool,

1403
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:23.710
what's that called?
When you get Bunyan's get one of them things,
whatever

1404
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.300
manufacturer shit,
drink your black coffee.

1405
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.760
But don't you think it's nice to have a community like that where they're just

1406
01:23:30.761 --> 01:23:32.510
all about yoga and sought?
Not sure.

1407
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:35.620
I guess it's comfortable until the Zombie apocalypse hits and then I'm not

1408
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:39.310
fucking relying on that on live.
You don't want to live to the Zombie apocalypse.

1409
01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.960
Why you don't?

1410
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.330
Boulder boulder is impossibly relaxed,
watched the walking dead,

1411
01:23:46.331 --> 01:23:47.320
which I don't anymore.

1412
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.460
But when I used to watch it all the time for the just annoying me to the point

1413
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:54.310
where I couldn't take anymore,
have to her while I was always like,

1414
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:57.760
I don't want to do this.
Why would you want to do this to survive?

1415
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:59.680
I mean people commit suicide now.

1416
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:04.681
Guys that are doing well in their life is great and they have loved ones and

1417
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.280
they commit suicide.

1418
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.890
You tell me that people are just going to live through this nonsense.

1419
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.410
Me Bring up the Dresden before and after the war.

1420
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.570
Take a look at that and they say in the middle as it was his,
how's his son,

1421
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.920
Jesus.
Speaking of 200 degrees because of the,
when the allies bombed it,

1422
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:23.730
but just take a look at the,
what it looked like before and after.
Ooh,

1423
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:28.200
we're so lucky we don't have to tolerate that kind of shit right now.

1424
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:32.400
I remember who was the guy who wrote,
Oh God,
where the,
where the,

1425
01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:36.690
where the monsters are or where the,
uh,
I wrote a children's book.

1426
01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.870
It was a call where the monsters are and he was,
we was in the war and he said,

1427
01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:43.590
do you believe in God?
And he said,
and he just casually said,
no,
no,

1428
01:24:43.591 --> 01:24:46.680
the war took care of that for me.
I never forgot it.

1429
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:50.820
He just died in five years ago.

1430
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:54.870
I had Eddie Izzard on yesterday and we were talking about wars of aggression.

1431
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:58.080
And that most likely we've seen the end of wars of aggression.

1432
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.560
It's trying to conquer new territory like that.

1433
01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:03.360
World War II was probably the last one of those.

1434
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.450
Look at that man that's said that was dressed in dress and look like the surface

1435
01:25:06.451 --> 01:25:11.430
of the moon too.
They were really done with it.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1436
01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:17.130
Oh my God.
That lady got barbecued.
Yeah,
it's hell terrific.

1437
01:25:17.131 --> 01:25:21.120
Those are all bodies,
man.
She hadn't,
that was their stress and their host that,

1438
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:25.410
that bill will go,
stop scrolling.
Look at that.
What the fuck,
man?

1439
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.150
That's what war did.
That's what World War II was the structure of old Europe.

1440
01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.950
Imagine what it would look like to,

1441
01:25:31.951 --> 01:25:36.540
to watch those bombs hit and just level everything like that was carpet bombing

1442
01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.090
civilians that,
you know,
the,
the objective was actually to kill the Ra,

1443
01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.400
the German worker,
to really bring that country to its knees.
It was,

1444
01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:48.990
it was back when total devastation and the enemy was essentially a tactic.

1445
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:52.350
Um,
it was a horrible,
horrible thing.

1446
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:58.120
Wow.
Yeah.
It's,
is,
these images is so stunning.
Oh,
sure.

1447
01:25:58.121 --> 01:26:02.850
This is now human beings rebuild.
Yet they prevail.
Yeah.
And you know,

1448
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.590
<v 1>that's okay.
Um,</v>

1449
01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:11.300
we were talking about yesterday was that would most likely have seen the end of

1450
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:14.610
these wars of conquest where people are trying to take over new territory.

1451
01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:19.580
It's territory is no longer a commodity now it's services,
it's ideas,

1452
01:26:19.581 --> 01:26:24.350
it's technologies,
it's the land in that sense.
What do you need?

1453
01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:27.020
Concept was that we're moving in a better direction.

1454
01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:31.280
That things are becoming less and less,
at least overtly aggressive,

1455
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.760
more people that are able to see what's really going on too and more people can

1456
01:26:34.761 --> 01:26:35.320
communicate.

1457
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.320
And this is really the only generation ever like these last two or three

1458
01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:45.431
generations where you were able to easily translate anything that anyone saying

1459
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.450
any other country.
Like how often do you go?

1460
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:49.410
Like I'll read like could be of Madoff's,

1461
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:53.390
I'm a Instagram page and it's in Russian,
you know,

1462
01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:55.370
and I'll translate it and so I could read what he's saying.

1463
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:56.930
And I do that with a lot of his other fighters too.

1464
01:26:56.931 --> 01:26:59.310
I just hit the translate button.
Yeah.
I how dope is that?

1465
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.970
Closer to that we'll do you get to know them.
You know,
you know,
and you,

1466
01:27:03.971 --> 01:27:08.210
you see that they,
they're pretty fucking similar.
Even though they're different,

1467
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.440
you know,
they're into family worship and their food and their community.

1468
01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:16.790
They laugh,
they laugh.
Yeah.
I mean its humor,
assaults with each other.

1469
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:19.370
If you live there,
you'd be in that style of living too.

1470
01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:22.110
And it's a hard place to live.
So you gotta be a tough mother fucker.

1471
01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:25.270
That's right.
Yeah,
that's right.
But there's a predict there's,

1472
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.330
there's something predictable too,

1473
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:30.350
about how to live their certain norms and practices

1474
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.700
with Russia being run by Putin.

1475
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:40.540
That seems to me to be the last big country that might invade somebody's like

1476
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:43.760
Russia being run by Putin.

1477
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:47.240
You could almost see him pulling the Crimea somewhere else in the world.

1478
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.280
You could almost see him.

1479
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:52.450
<v 0>I think Russia and I think the history of Russia.</v>

1480
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:56.230
I have not been there.
I was there when I was very young,

1481
01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.710
but I've not been there since I and I have people who have gotten there and
they,

1482
01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:02.710
they actually really enjoy it.
Then it's,
you know,

1483
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:04.960
just great people like great people.

1484
01:28:04.961 --> 01:28:09.610
The Russian people who suffered maybe more than anybody in the 20th century,

1485
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:13.210
but great people and industrious and everything else.

1486
01:28:13.211 --> 01:28:17.300
But I do think that they're run by a gangster.
Well,

1487
01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.740
but it's not just that they're run by a gangster.
Yes,

1488
01:28:20.741 --> 01:28:25.741
but I think that sometimes the way a populace thinks about certain things can

1489
01:28:30.281 --> 01:28:32.500
inform their destiny.

1490
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.830
So think about this.

1491
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:41.070
If you were always invaded and you had a flat topography and tanks could roll in

1492
01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:44.770
German tanks,
whatever it is,
and you paid such a price price for that.
Again,

1493
01:28:44.771 --> 01:28:47.620
I told you when I went there in 1985 you didn't see any old men.

1494
01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.690
They were all killed.
But aggression,

1495
01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.500
male aggression was what kept those Nazis it bag and when they were,

1496
01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:59.740
when they surrounded Leningrad.
Now Saint Petersburg and stuff like that.

1497
01:28:59.770 --> 01:29:00.603
A lot of stories.

1498
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.080
And I think that when you've been traumatized to the extent that Russia has been

1499
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:10.740
traumatized,
certain strengths,
you know,

1500
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:15.420
the ability to stand up against aggression and to be brave and powerful,

1501
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.830
those become that.
That becomes the commodity.
That's where,

1502
01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:22.890
that's the guy that gets all the money,
all the women,
all the,
you know,
whatever.

1503
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.500
And I think that's a product of their history.
So Putin is an admired man.

1504
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:31.260
Putin get,
I bet you if an had very fair elections,

1505
01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:34.320
he would get elected in to power.
He's respected.

1506
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:38.170
You tryna see does not fair elections.
Yeah.
Well now it is a larger,

1507
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.550
my larger point is on the record.
I'm not saying that,
I'm not saying that sir.

1508
01:29:41.551 --> 01:29:44.040
I don't know anything about Russian elections,
but I will say this.

1509
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.720
I don't know why you're putting words in my mouth.

1510
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.700
[inaudible] what the Hell's going on?
We'd get elected anyway.
I think so.

1511
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:54.240
So love them.
So my allowed open criticism of them.

1512
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.640
Well there is open criticism,
believe it or not.
Sure.

1513
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.940
The guys who get shot no openly criticized and then they get shot.

1514
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:02.280
There's actually,
there's actually,

1515
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:06.110
there is a press that actually is critical.
Right,
right,
right.

1516
01:30:06.111 --> 01:30:10.020
But you know,
they've killed journalists.
He's not a threat to his power.
Well,

1517
01:30:10.021 --> 01:30:12.720
how many,
how many journalists have been murdered,
I don't know.

1518
01:30:12.721 --> 01:30:16.650
But enough always ends and all kinds of weird shit.
Google,
Google journalists,

1519
01:30:16.651 --> 01:30:19.950
critical of Putin murdered also.
His supporters will beat the shit out of you.

1520
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:24.990
Yeah.
So sure.
So,
so,
so what I'm saying is that I think Russia's,

1521
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:28.950
what are you saying?
I think Russia needs to embrace a diff,

1522
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.420
the softer strengths.
Are you a foreign policy advisor?
Yes,
I am.
They said no.

1523
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:36.480
This is a philosophy I have.
This is my philosophy.
Ready?
Okay.

1524
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:39.910
So my philosophy has blessed this country is a great country and our culture's

1525
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:41.470
an interesting culture.
Why?
Why?

1526
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.230
Because not only are we representative hard strengths,
the military,

1527
01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:50.220
the NFL,
the fucking UFC,
all that shit.
The what?

1528
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:54.580
Eagles and eagles' fucking ball,
right,
bro.
You're right.
That's a classic though.

1529
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:59.010
Canada is fucking national.
Anthem is a beaver.
Well,
Russia has a bear.
Okay.

1530
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.200
But so Americans,
again,
a very aggressive,

1531
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:02.880
but you know what America's trade secret is?

1532
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.730
We've also provided safe quarter two are gentler spirits.

1533
01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.500
Was this violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era.

1534
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:13.880
Okay,
so they'd just been doing that forever.
Yes.

1535
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:17.580
So there's just like presidents just do that in Russia.

1536
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:21.420
Always was half murder,
crossfire,
terrorist act.

1537
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:26.250
In 2008 there was six of those murder only.
There's another six.

1538
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:31.200
Listen,
two of them were brought to trial.
Look at me right now.
Putin is Gandhi.

1539
01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:33.340
Putin is Gandhi compared to Khrushchev.

1540
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.950
Gandhi compared to style and [inaudible] de Lennon,
Gannett compared to any,

1541
01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:42.630
anybody who was in power before him.
Those guys used to kill wholesale.

1542
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.960
I mean,
and that's a fact up to their elbows in blood.

1543
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:48.660
Who's that guy that got murdered recently that was running?

1544
01:31:48.661 --> 01:31:51.840
It was a political opponent.
This shot that dude down.

1545
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:55.320
So when his death was not related to the journalist's work,

1546
01:31:55.321 --> 01:32:00.250
the conviction rate exceeds 90% what to put him in jail too if they don't just

1547
01:32:00.251 --> 01:32:02.890
kill him when the debt.
What does that quote though?

1548
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:06.940
When the death was not related to the journalist's work to convict.

1549
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:11.950
So you're talking about the rates of conviction.
That was a weird quote.
Oh,

1550
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:15.870
rates of conviction are very high.
Yeah,
of course
they do.

1551
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.110
That's all about you though.
Espionage,
those kinds of trials.
Yeah.

1552
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:23.680
You're going straight to the pokey son.
Do not pass.
Go.
Good luck.
What you trial.

1553
01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:28.390
That's true.
The judge is like,
yeah,
listen to Ya.
20 years.
Fuck off.

1554
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.190
But aggression,
aggressive part of the world.
United States like Russia,
however,

1555
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.100
we're smarter.
No,
we're better.
Nope,
we might attack.

1556
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:41.350
We pray our funnier.
Why are we funnier?
Because we're better.

1557
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.010
That's the two generals are on James at the comedy store general.

1558
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:51.760
This is a quiz.
Why?
Because we print,

1559
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:56.770
we have protections for our people on the fringes are creatives.

1560
01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:01.630
Our weirdos are Fashionista is all the people that make our culture interesting.

1561
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:06.520
Steven jobs,
he wasn't good at crossfit.
No.
He's going to yell at an employee.

1562
01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:09.430
Either was this gay guy named Martin Luther King,
but they,

1563
01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:12.790
but we provide at least there was Duke recourse.

1564
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:17.440
At least we know that there are softer strengths.
I have to be protected.

1565
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.380
It makes you more interesting and it makes you more creative and stronger.

1566
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:25.570
You gotta be innovative.
You're innovators are Weirdos like Leonardo Da Vinci.

1567
01:33:25.571 --> 01:33:30.190
I apparently was gay.
What?
I sat it rages.
Wait a minute.

1568
01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:35.020
Guess what?
What?
There are a lot of very smart in Russia.
If you're gay,

1569
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:37.790
it's not that safe for you,
right?
You get tossed off a building.

1570
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.370
So what you do is when you do that with people who are creative and you

1571
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.740
marginalize a group of people cause they're different in the name of purity or

1572
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:48.970
whatever,
like really weird public statement about homosexuality.

1573
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.180
The law in Russia,
like just homosexuality,
illegal in Russia,

1574
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.760
well a lot of times they're acquainted with pedophiles.

1575
01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:58.540
The LGB community has real trouble there and,
and it's hard to get apartments.

1576
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03.460
It's more of subtle.
It's hard to,
it's hard to just live and make a living.

1577
01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:08.110
So what happens is all those creative people who could be contributing and

1578
01:34:08.111 --> 01:34:12.400
coming up with beautiful ideas there,
they're marginalizes perverts,

1579
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.500
deviance.
And that's the dumbest.
Don't get to inherit the earth.

1580
01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:19.950
The meek.
A lot of times that the people that provide you your fucking good.

1581
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:24.130
He's Russian gay propaganda law for the purpose of protecting children from

1582
01:34:24.131 --> 01:34:28.450
information,
advocating for a denial of traditional family values.

1583
01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:32.930
Oh,
the gay propaganda law and the anti gay law.
The bill.

1584
01:34:32.931 --> 01:34:37.720
It was unanimously approved by the State Duma on 11th of June,

1585
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:40.270
2013th Holy Shit,
man.

1586
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:44.860
Said he wanted to protect children from exposure to,
you know,
home activity.

1587
01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:49.870
Yeah,
and it was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on the 30th of June,

1588
01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:52.950
2013 how long is he going to be president?
So let me,

1589
01:34:53.150 --> 01:34:55.420
let me ask you a better question.
So with those kinds of laws,

1590
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:57.860
this kind of loss that marginalize anybody that's not,

1591
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.930
that's not normal quote unquote,

1592
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.700
that's not traditional prototypical male female.
Right.
Awesome.

1593
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:06.830
When was the last time you bought,
and I'll wait,

1594
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.740
what was the last time you bought one Russian product please?

1595
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:12.560
Besides the fact that they're essentially a one crop economy,

1596
01:35:12.561 --> 01:35:14.630
which is oil and I guess some other commodities.

1597
01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.360
What happens is you kill all your creativity.

1598
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.810
What happens is you are not a strong country.
Your weapon read isn't even good.

1599
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.660
That's the irony of all this shit,
right?

1600
01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.970
You had that mindset and you have one idea of what strength is.

1601
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:28.820
You're going to be fucking week and you're not going to be creative as a

1602
01:35:28.821 --> 01:35:31.280
coalition and coffee.
Good rifle.
It's a very good rifle.

1603
01:35:31.281 --> 01:35:33.920
Made some good shit design in 1957 I believe.

1604
01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:40.230
2012 previously holding the position for 2000 2008 so he's been right now he's

1605
01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:46.330
on seven years in office are,
sorry,
he's been longer that learn that.
Yeah,

1606
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:48.830
but I mean seven now currently.

1607
01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:52.100
And then he did eight years before.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1608
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.560
But he didn't even take four years off when he took four years off.

1609
01:35:54.561 --> 01:35:57.920
He was like running shit from behind.
He's got to look like I'll kill you.

1610
01:35:58.250 --> 01:36:01.430
Like he's like a little [inaudible].
It's a black belt in judo.

1611
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.730
[inaudible] yeah.
Legit black belt in judo.

1612
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:07.700
Like he could actually throw people around.
Probably smart as fuck.

1613
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:09.470
And in his mind,

1614
01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.910
you know Putin is running a country that requires a strong man.
Yeah.
It's,

1615
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:19.550
it's who they respect.
So he's caught in that too.
Even if he agreed to the world.

1616
01:36:19.670 --> 01:36:23.480
Let's say you're the king of the world.
How do you fix Russia?
You,
you,

1617
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:26.900
you come back,
come at them with up,
you present an idea,

1618
01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.760
the idea I just presented,

1619
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:33.590
which is the idea that you might want to protect the people that you consider to

1620
01:36:33.591 --> 01:36:37.220
be queer as deviants and Weirdos,
nerds or whatever they are.

1621
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.900
Because those people a lot of times are your creatives.
I don't know why,

1622
01:36:41.901 --> 01:36:42.734
but they are.

1623
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:47.960
And I think they lived in too much of a wartime culture for like for too long

1624
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:51.230
identity,
develop this hardness to them that yes,

1625
01:36:51.231 --> 01:36:55.480
why they're lacking in the creativity and the innovation and make it a forward

1626
01:36:55.481 --> 01:36:56.170
that.
And I don't.

1627
01:36:56.170 --> 01:36:59.420
And I think that a lot of times when you've been traumatized that you're,

1628
01:36:59.421 --> 01:37:03.620
you're dealing still with the residue and the trauma of World War One and World

1629
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.310
War II.
And that's very real.
And you know,
and also by the way,

1630
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:11.210
communism and having nothing and,
and you know,

1631
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.590
they have strong communities.
I mean,

1632
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.470
my friend went to Russia and said everybody was nice to him.

1633
01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.120
Fucking they're good people and they're innovative people in their critic.

1634
01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:20.480
Look at how good they are at boxing.

1635
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:23.210
Anything the Russians put their mind to that they,

1636
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:27.310
that they hold value for like strengths,
like MMA,
like,

1637
01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:30.160
like boxing.
Look at how good they are.
So they're,

1638
01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:34.550
they're incredibly industrious discipline,
smart people.
And I just wish there,

1639
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:38.300
I'm sorry,
how to get weed over.
No,
I bet you don't.
I bet if you have money,

1640
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:40.430
you get everything you want.
Right?
If you got money.
Yeah.

1641
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.360
If you're connected to the oligarchy,
but,
but I think Putin's ever tried DMT.

1642
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.360
I think he's too measured for that.
Well,
I think you would want to know,
you know,

1643
01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.350
maybe I based on a lot of shit,
he does whatever he wants.
Yeah,
for sure.

1644
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:56.184
Bizarre.

1645
01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 1>How many,
how many checks do you think he's gotten?
A stable.
Wow.
I,</v>

1646
01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.680
I will tell you this,
I truly believe this.
I think that he does.

1647
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:09.360
He can just sit there and he has women flock to him.
Oh,
for sure.

1648
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:12.120
They love him for sure.
The best of them in the world.

1649
01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:16.800
He doesn't have to do it right.
It's not going to power.
My wife was like,
he's,

1650
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.940
he's hot.
Whoa.
I go,
but he's,
he's a gangster.
She does.

1651
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:24.690
Who doesn't like a gangster?
Ooh.
I was like,
Ooh,
Jeez.
I had to walk away.

1652
01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:27.180
I was like,
Whoa,
it's uncomfortable.
Steal your girl.
Yeah.

1653
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:30.450
The take your Arrow still your,
your football right here with that.

1654
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.400
Know the story,
but fucking Sturge will told me about this.
He,

1655
01:38:35.401 --> 01:38:39.330
uh,
who was the football player where Putin stole his ring.

1656
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.520
Google that it's a,
the owner of the Patriots.
Was it him?
It wasn't a player,

1657
01:38:44.521 --> 01:38:47.810
it was just the owner of the Patriots.
Is that the guy that craft that guy?
Okay.

1658
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:52.020
So he had this a Superbowl ring on it meets Putin.
Putin says,

1659
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:54.450
can I hold the ring?
You know,
and then like takes the ring off,

1660
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:56.640
puts it on and it's like,
hmm.
He said something like,

1661
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:58.350
you could smash someone's face with this ring.

1662
01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:01.920
And laughed and then just walked off of the ring and they were like,
Hey,
uh,

1663
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:06.720
where's the ring?
He's like,
no,
he just stole the ring.
You know,

1664
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:11.700
Harvey cartel.
Really?
He just took his ring,
my ring.
No,
that's awesome.

1665
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:13.650
This murdering a dick.

1666
01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:16.740
So he just decided he wanted it and took it off the guy's hand and this is

1667
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:20.440
laughing and walked off with it.
As the story goes,
crap handed.

1668
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.970
The diamond studded ring to Putin is a bit of show and tell I could kill someone

1669
01:39:23.971 --> 01:39:27.660
to string.
Putin reportedly said as he fitted to his finger,

1670
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.160
then we craft how did his hand to get it back.

1671
01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:33.300
Putin surrounded by KGB agents were this least slipped the ring into his pocket.

1672
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.170
Wow.
News circulating quickly.
The ring was not meant to as a gift,

1673
01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:39.480
which prompted craft to issue the statement at the time.

1674
01:39:39.481 --> 01:39:42.840
At the end of a very productive three hour business meeting with President
Putin,

1675
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.630
I showed the president my most recent Superbowl ring craft set.

1676
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:47.580
Upon seeing the ring President Putin,

1677
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.910
a great knowledgeable sports fan was clearly taken by its uniqueness.

1678
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:51.721
At that point,

1679
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:55.410
I decided to give him the rings assembled the respect and admiration that I have

1680
01:39:55.411 --> 01:39:58.120
for the Russian people and the leadership of President Putin,

1681
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:03.000
Aka I wanna live.
I wanna live.
Love it.

1682
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:06.360
I take this,
this murdering them.
I,

1683
01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.580
I do have an admiration.

1684
01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:12.330
I just think you think he's ever killed anybody with a ring?
Uh,
yes.

1685
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:17.160
Probably he wasn't,
but AGB guy for people to death.
George W.

1686
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.790
Bush administration had pressured him at the time to let go of the ring to avoid

1687
01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:23.220
an international incident.
That's hilarious.
Wow.

1688
01:40:23.221 --> 01:40:27.420
In 2013 craft reneged and offered some backstory about the incident.

1689
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:30.930
A legging alleging that the Bush administration had pressured him at the time to

1690
01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:33.420
let go of the ring.
Wow.

1691
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:37.950
It would really be in the best interest of us Soviet relations if you meant to

1692
01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:41.400
give the ring as a present craft or crawls the White House saying,

1693
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:45.270
I really didn't want to.
I had an emotional tie to the ring.
It has my name on it.

1694
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:49.800
Kraft said,
I didn't want to see it on Ebay,
but met maybe putting this stuff.

1695
01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:52.710
I know there's a language barrier so you probably miss.
Understood,

1696
01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:53.980
but he's saying no,
he

1697
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.160
<v 0>didn't shut the fuck up.
They will you a Russian propaganda agent.</v>

1698
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:00.520
There was a pause at the other end of the line and the White House voice

1699
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:03.610
repeated.
It would really be in the best interest.

1700
01:41:03.611 --> 01:41:06.820
If you meant to give the ring as a putting the faith,
bro.
No,

1701
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:09.640
I'm saying that your dad,
when he took that ring,

1702
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:14.920
he punked out dude and took his ring.
It's not a thief.
He's gangster.

1703
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:15.870
Yeah.

1704
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:20.650
Was up there pumpkin Harvey Keitel to drive 124 diamonds.

1705
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:25.780
The Great Harvey Keitel.
Yes.
Told me a story.
Think it was him.
They said,
you know,

1706
01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:30.640
remember that I wouldn't know.
Um,
what's that?
What's that?
Fucking that La femme.

1707
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:35.560
Nikita not indicated the actress and the TV show.
Yes.
I've met her once.
She was,

1708
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:38.770
she went to Russia,
Candy Alexander,
so to ask.
Okay,

1709
01:41:38.771 --> 01:41:42.400
so she went to Russia with her boyfriend.
The Putin liked her.

1710
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:46.400
He used to watch the show all the time.
I heard this from,
I bought,

1711
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:47.860
I think it was Harvey Keitel.

1712
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:53.700
He kept that dude out into another room and had her out on the balcony talking

1713
01:41:56.351 --> 01:41:59.070
to her the whole time and basically he,

1714
01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:03.340
the guy couldn't get back in and it was very clear that Putin was making a play

1715
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.000
for La Femme,
Nikita.
And it's like,
you're in my town now.

1716
01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:11.470
You go take a seat and then you came here to take a seat.

1717
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:14.290
I'm going to take what's mine and apparently she was gone.

1718
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:16.600
I don't think she did anything obviously,
but you know,

1719
01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:19.470
let's pretend she did right there it is.
There it is,

1720
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:24.250
and he dug her was what it was.
Jack Nicholson and around Bro.
Not around.

1721
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:29.340
He's not there bro.
He's not allowed to be in his have legs for this.

1722
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.910
He was apparently locked out.

1723
01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:33.760
He was like trying to get in the room and there was all right.
We didn't know.

1724
01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.140
It's kind of interesting when you see a guy running the country like that in

1725
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:43.141
2019 that he's could run the country in that gangster fashion Morris thing that

1726
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:47.320
he got people to Sean Penn.
Yeah.

1727
01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.640
It's more interesting to me that he's gotten himself in a position where people

1728
01:42:51.641 --> 01:42:55.330
would actually vote for,
so it technically,
it's been democratically.
I liked it.

1729
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.620
Yeah.
I bet.

1730
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:59.860
At a certain point in time they don't know who the fuck should be running things

1731
01:42:59.861 --> 01:43:04.150
over there.
Yeah,
probably Kalika in this end early today,
my friend,

1732
01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:08.710
always great.
Always come see me.

they're listening still.

1737
01:43:26.610 --> 01:43:30.680
May 17,
18.
I got some days too that I just started selling.
Um,

1738
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.790
that just went on sale.

Dammit.

Come from and keep your arms heavy in your belly tight.
What does that mean?

1747
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:10.480
It just sounds like an awesome thing.
It's heavy.
I want my aunt Billy Joel Song.

1748
