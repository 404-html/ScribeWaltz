00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>But what they're essentially doing is just piecing together what they think is</v>

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:12.771
<v Speaker 1>like an argument based on these predetermined patterns that they've picked up.</v>

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>as you as a white male wouldn't understand a woman of color what fucking color</v>

8
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you will like what you're white.</v>

9
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

10
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you're Asian,</v>

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but I mean when you're talking about the color of your skin,</v>

12
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't say color.</v>

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.873
<v Speaker 1>You just can't,</v>

14
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you might want to say ethnicity.</v>

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.311
<v Speaker 1>You might want to say,</v>

16
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:29.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.923
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

19
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

21
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

22
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

23
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

25
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 2>let me clarify.</v>

26
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

27
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I completely concede that there is a lived experience of being a certain,</v>

28
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 2>being a minority ethnicity,</v>

29
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 2>especially in America or in Australia,</v>

30
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>new countries that is different from being a white man.</v>

32
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely concede that.</v>

33
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 2>The thing is why can't we talk about the actual details of the experience</v>

34
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 2>without assuming that there's a homogeneity between that experience as well.</v>

35
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Like not every Asian experience in America is the same.</v>

36
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.270
<v Speaker 2>They have certain commonalities in that they're subject to racism in a way that</v>

37
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:08.104
<v Speaker 2>you and I aren't,</v>

38
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 2>but they are so wildly different.</v>

39
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the details of the experience and what's acceptable and how we,</v>

40
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 2>how we want to converse with one another.</v>

41
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's not assume that because a person has a particular set bunch of labels</v>

42
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:21.064
<v Speaker 2>attached to them,</v>

43
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>

44
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>

45
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.541
<v Speaker 2>Asian,</v>

46
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>white man,</v>

47
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

48
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.251
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

49
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>that that immediately disqualifies them from having a conversation about these</v>

50
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

51
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's weird when you look at people from that error and you consider</v>

52
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>that was him.</v>

53
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.973
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

54
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking groovy mustache.</v>

55
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you love to go back in time and hang out with John L.</v>

56
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Sullivan?</v>

57
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>We use the fucking heavyweight champion of the world.</v>

58
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine some of the old school puts you,</v>

60
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>that guy got old school place.</v>

61
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>You imagine what it must've been like.</v>

62
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Just a funny saying.</v>

63
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>In Sullivan's era,</v>

64
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>no formal boxing titles existed.</v>

65
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>He became a champion after defeating Patty Ryan and Mississippi City near Gulf</v>

66
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Port Mississippi on February 7th,</v>

67
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>1882 modern authorities have retroactively labeled Ryan the heavyweight champion</v>

68
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:09.974
<v Speaker 1>of America.</v>

69
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>But any claim to Ryan being a world champion would have been dubious.</v>

70
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He had never contended internationally as Sullivan had.</v>

71
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I could lick Patty Ryan,</v>

72
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.303
<v Speaker 1>not crazy.</v>

73
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Sullivan was first considered the world heavyweight champion after either 1888</v>

74
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Charlie Mitchell in France or the following year when he knocked</v>

75
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.841
<v Speaker 1>out Jake kill rain in a ready for this round 75 I told you,</v>

76
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.293
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

77
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Have a scheduled 80 round.</v>

78
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>They a schedule the schedule.</v>

79
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know the head of the end told off fuck set.</v>

80
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Round 75 that hurts my head.</v>

81
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Just how long was he drowned though?</v>

82
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Is he trying to like two seconds?</v>

83
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it was three minutes.</v>

84
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just like it is today.</v>

85
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.281
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

86
00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:58.581
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

87
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>what does an in time,</v>

88
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.750
<v Speaker 1>what does that and what the fuck is 75 times fat and a half,</v>

89
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.074
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

90
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>225 minutes.</v>

91
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

92
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

93
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>that's sane.</v>

94
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing a podcast.</v>

95
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.421
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

96
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine bare knuckle boxing a guy for three hours?</v>

97
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 3>How much do you believe in,</v>

98
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 3>whether it is DNA or a soul or something like something that's purely uniquely</v>

99
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.130
<v Speaker 3>about that person when they are born and that's part of our day are or match</v>

100
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 3>matches called a cherry.</v>

101
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 3>You know the famous nurture versus culture debate.</v>

102
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.851
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

103
00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 3>what's your take on what's more important in this?</v>

104
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

105
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Well they have done studies where they've taken twins that were separated at</v>

106
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>

107
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>there were adopted and they get them together after not seeing each other entire</v>

108
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.540
<v Speaker 1>life and they find out they like the same kind of music.</v>

109
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

110
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>They have very similar likes and dislikes.</v>

112
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Their personalities are very similar.</v>

113
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a strong argument for nature over nurture.</v>

114
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

115
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.710
<v Speaker 1>But there's no denying that nurture plays a huge role as well.</v>

116
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:02.191
<v Speaker 1>I should take,</v>

117
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:03.090
<v Speaker 1>it's either or.</v>

118
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I think we live in a soup of possibilities and I think that you can get super</v>

119
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:14.301
<v Speaker 1>lucky with the amount of exposure that you have to positive and even to negative</v>

120
00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:15.414
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

121
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Like there's an expression,</v>

122
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>hard times make good people,</v>

123
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:24.231
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that in a certain sense that there's some experiences that</v>

125
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>children and adults even have that they get through and it makes them more</v>

126
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:29.791
<v Speaker 1>empathetic.</v>

127
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It makes them kinder and make some more understanding and it makes them</v>

128
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:33.661
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

129
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>like more,</v>

130
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.033
<v Speaker 1>more character.</v>

131
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.021
<v Speaker 3>Even that the way,</v>

132
00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because you're right,</v>

133
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's part of that argument that's south at through and you do see that</v>

134
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 3>happen a lot and then you see somebody who was through the exact same thing and</v>

135
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 3>it makes them 10 times more of an asshole.</v>

136
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

137
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I go heart song on her and everybody else into pyrolysis and of them and he's</v>

138
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

139
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 3>That's where you think like what is the make these one person make a right turn</v>

140
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 3>and go in and their action where they become kinder and nicer because they felt</v>

141
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 3>what it is to get hurt and what is the other one may make the complete opposite</v>

142
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 3>turn and go in a direction of Aiga hearts.</v>

143
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't care for anybody else's feeding.</v>

144
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has to pay for the Fed that I go heart ones.</v>

145
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

146
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.801
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>

147
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

148
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's that moment where you can really make a 90 degree turn one way</v>

149
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:16.774
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

150
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 3>What is the make people make the choices they make.</v>

151
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think hormones have a stigma in this country because of Barry bonds and</v>

152
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:29.030
<v Speaker 1>fucking Sammy Sosa and all this crazy shit where everybody's like,</v>

153
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.421
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

154
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking cheaters in baseball.</v>

155
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>They ruined everything and sports and everyone is so concerned with um,</v>

156
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>what we hear about with cheating and steroids and athletic performance that then</v>

157
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you're missing out on a core essential aspect of being a human being,</v>

158
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.280
<v Speaker 1>being a man,</v>

159
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>especially um,</v>

160
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the lack of testosterone directly related to depression,</v>

161
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 1>directly related to these,</v>

162
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>these people that start hitting age regardless of traumatic brain injury,</v>

163
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>they start getting older and they feel like fucking shit.</v>

164
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>They feel like shit.</v>

165
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked to a lot of them that get on testosterone and all of a sudden</v>

166
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>their glow again,</v>

167
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>they have energy.</v>

168
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>They want to start doing things there are active.</v>

169
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:16.091
<v Speaker 1>And someone I've talked to guys who are on testosterone that don't like to talk</v>

170
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>about it because they're worried that someone's going to look at them first of</v>

171
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>all as being inferior because they need to add,</v>

172
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>artificial testosterone to their system and that they're,</v>

174
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>they might be a roid head now.</v>

175
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>They might be a cheater and some like,</v>

176
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking planet?</v>

177
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>You're 55 years old,</v>

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>you playing major league baseball behind my back with the life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're doing too good with these new home.</v>

181
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you'll take aspirin if you have a fucking headache,</v>

182

<v Speaker 1>you take Ibuprofen,</v>

183
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll take medication if you're sick.</v>

184
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Like why won't you take testosterone?</v>

185
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Why won't you get your hormone levels change?</v>

186
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I have a very good friend that won't do it because he's afraid of all these</v>

187
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:52.821
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

188
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

189
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:53.420

194
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.820
<v Speaker 2>down with a guy two weeks ago,</v>

195
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:06.660

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.130
<v Speaker 2>how much more important it is to to reach out to these guys and,</v>

223
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Bears transmit sexually transmitted diseases to each other or they die people.</v>

224
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I think two is once you get the clap,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's killing them though.</v>

230
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.733
<v Speaker 2>Like as an eight,</v>

231
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.120

236
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

237
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>we're so funny with what we want to keep around.</v>

238
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Speaker 1>You know we have this idea that we are in charge somehow or another,</v>

239
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:28.420
<v Speaker 1>making sure that animals don't go extinct and the like Koala bear needs to stay</v>

240
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

241
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.560

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

245
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:33.640

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but if they all died because of fucking herpes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe we should concentrate on poor people before we concentrate on</v>

249
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.691
<v Speaker 1>herpes.</v>
