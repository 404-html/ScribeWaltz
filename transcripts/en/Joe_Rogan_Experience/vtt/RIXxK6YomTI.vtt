1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Still sexual because of society,</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>that's why women think of women as being sexual.</v>

4
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like women will make out with women and party with women,</v>

5
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>and part of it is because they think that guys like it.</v>

6
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.931
<v Speaker 1>But also part of it is because in our society that it has been deemed that women</v>

7
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>are more sexual,</v>

8
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>they're more sex objects.</v>

9
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>They use them to sell watches and cars and shit like that.</v>

10
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's more natural and accepted.</v>

11
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>So I think a gay guy would have way less problems fucking a straight girl than a</v>

12
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>straight guy would have fucking a gay guy.</v>

13
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

14
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.301
<v Speaker 1>So if you said to a guy,</v>

16
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:30.511
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

17
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.051
<v Speaker 1>fuck a girl,</v>

18
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>he probably do it quicker than a Hetero guy would fuck another guy in the ass.</v>

19
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Even though he'd fuck is going on the last,</v>

20
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the Hetero guy was in prison.</v>

21
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's then it's alive.</v>

22
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Different Ball because guys,</v>

23
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>guys are saying,</v>

24
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gay,</v>

25
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>but just made it put my cooking something.</v>

26
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a strange thing,</v>

28
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:45.391
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

29
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>How much humans adapt?</v>

30
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They adapt so much that straight people become gay.</v>

31
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>While they're in jail to jail.</v>

32
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I've become the best master bedroom on the planet.</v>

33
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking get artwork.</v>

34
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I saw a shank that someone made at a toilet paper.</v>

35
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>They don't know exactly how the dude did this,</v>

36
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but he somehow or another created a shank and use something to harden to toilet</v>

37
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:07.854
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

38
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>shank dues.</v>

39
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing ever.</v>

40
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean just you think about human ingenuity and one of the things about prison</v>

41
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>is that these guys are forced to adapt and survive and you know,</v>

42
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>and kind of use their ingenuity.</v>

43
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's their creativity and create things that no one,</v>

44
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that's why they develop tattoo needles with,</v>

45
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>at a take pens and they get the ink and they,</v>

47
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll burn things and use the,</v>

48
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:30.701
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

49
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:30.931
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

50
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:31.764
<v Speaker 1>the milk.</v>

51
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>They'll like make ink.</v>

52
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>They make their own ink out of burning plastic and burning paper.</v>

53
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And then they figured out how to make some sort of a machine with a battery.</v>

54
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's really kind of amazing some of the things that people had done in jail.</v>

55
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>But this was one of the weirdest man.</v>

56
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>The guy made a weapon out of toilet paper.</v>

57
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone with it or don't they found it?</v>

58
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I think they found it,</v>

59
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

60
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck this guy did to make the toilet paper hard.</v>

61
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.681
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

62
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>he had made it to the point where it was like plaster.</v>

63
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.831
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

64
00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.281
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

65
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>he like he had developed a shank and actual shank out of toilet paper.</v>

66
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.451
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

67
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>it's one plus on everyone.</v>

68
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I end up fucking imprisonment.</v>

69
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I would not survive.</v>

70
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a dark fucking world man.</v>

71
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who just got out of this guy warm machine,</v>

72
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:11.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:11.881
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>

74
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So one machine can be nice guy.</v>

75
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Writer's room twitting.</v>

76
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You ask him where you were playing.</v>

77
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.214
<v Speaker 1>he got a,</v>

79
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>he got in some shit on Twitter.</v>

80
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a pretty experienced.</v>

81
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

82
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.361
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.194
<v Speaker 1>And that's just,</v>

84
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>that's just small time shit that's just doing a year.</v>

85
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you watch those locked down shows,</v>

87
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to scary man.</v>

88
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>There's windows in Jersey for strike force.</v>

89
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember driving back to the airport.</v>

90
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what was Newark or JFK or whatever,</v>

91
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but on the way to the airport actually we you drove,</v>

92
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you drove past a prison yard and in Australia,</v>

93
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>like in Melbourne we have one prison.</v>

94
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>We have bough in prison now,</v>

95
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:44.761
<v Speaker 1>which is in the country.</v>

96
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like out of Melbourne.</v>

97
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>We used to have a um,</v>

98
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>a one right in the heart of the city but now it's out.</v>

100
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not used to saint prisoners and like we drove past a prison yard and like</v>

101
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>as you driving past the fucking fence to the prisoners right there with</v>

102
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>prisoners walking around in fucking orange.</v>

103
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>And even though I was in a cab or sort of shit myself,</v>

104
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>just not used to sing that being from Australia,</v>

105
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm like prisoners right there,</v>

106
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.680
<v Speaker 1>right near the road.</v>

107
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I can see them walking around.</v>

108
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.200
<v Speaker 1>The president is very kick,</v>

109
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.631
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

110
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:11.171
<v Speaker 1>big sign.</v>

111
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>The numbers of people in prisons,</v>

112
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>a big sign that this society is a mess.</v>

113
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>That's if you ever wanted like some real hardcore evidence as to how much of a</v>

114
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>mess I society is.</v>

115
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Our prison numbers are huge.</v>

116
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>More people are in prep,</v>

117
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>more black banner in prison right now then wherever.</v>

118
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Slaves.</v>

119
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

120
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

121
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.453
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

122
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.023
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true though.</v>

123
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.641
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

125
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:30.881
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

126
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>just the sheer numbers,</v>

127
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>there's millions of people.</v>

128
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>There's more people in jail in America,</v>

129
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>then all of China.</v>

130
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.211
<v Speaker 1>And that's incredible.</v>

131
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>When you consider China has over a billion people,</v>

132
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there's way more people in jail here.</v>

133
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

134
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>We have more people in jail than several countries.</v>

135
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you add up a bunch of different countries in a row,</v>

136
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>we have more putting more people in jail than them.</v>

137
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.401
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

138
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.031
<v Speaker 1>that is amazing.</v>

139
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>they make money off of it.</v>

141
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the sickest part about our jail system is that we have private business,</v>

142
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>the Giles Beta,</v>

143
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>very crammed and they're building more of them all the time and they're</v>

144
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>arresting people and more and more silly shit all the time.</v>

145
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.021

00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>which is in Melbourne's inner northern suburbs,</v>

168
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.230
<v Speaker 1>which has become quite a trendy spot at that moment.</v>

169
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Used to be just the big ethnic spot still is,</v>

170

<v Speaker 1>but pronounced Jr,</v>

202
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:24.880

203
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>the old English style for jail and old Melbourne Giles way.</v>

204
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Ned Kelly,</v>

205
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>who's the most famous criminal of all time.</v>

206
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:30.971
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

207
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Movies on him.</v>

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>He was the dude that wore like a fucking nightmare.</v>

209
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I thought chopper was the most short reads,</v>

210
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the most popular at the moment.</v>

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.300
<v Speaker 1>he's away.</v>

214
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>The last 10 years or so since Eric Bana did the movie.</v>

215
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 1>That was a great movie.</v>

216
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.990

<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

219
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>A bonafide celebrity now in Australia.</v>

220
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He's good.</v>

221
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I liked that a comedian who does the impressions of him hard enough.</v>

222
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Fuck out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Doing the weather and that talking a little about these hot enough fuck out.</v>

228
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.260

229
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>the whole criminal thing in,</v>

230
00:05:58.941 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>in Melbourne at the moment is really being glorified,</v>

232
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>especially at our mobsters because there's this underbelly TV series,</v>

233
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>which I think is hit America on one of the networks,</v>

234
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>but underbelly is intellect.</v>

235
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.704
<v Speaker 1>It's fourth season.</v>

236
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.131
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

237
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.391
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

238
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>it started off being about the,</v>

239
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

240
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the Melbourne underworld,</v>

241
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>the Italian mobs and the,</v>

242
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>the Aussie sort of mobs that were warring with each other over the last 15</v>

244
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

245
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>And there's only a few of them left now.</v>

246
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>They ended up mostly killing each other off,</v>

247
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just a news Piper's a full of it.</v>

248
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>An underbelly series is right.</v>

249
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so high in Australia.</v>

250
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:28.641
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

251
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

252
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a nation we've with,</v>

253
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.040

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.891
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

256
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes more popular.</v>

257
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

258
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.290

00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it.</v>

293
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

294
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.761
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

295
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the godfather movies.</v>

296
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the John Gadi thing in New York.</v>

297
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this weird sort of a romantic thing of knowing someone that's</v>

298
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:34.544
<v Speaker 1>in the Mafia.</v>

299
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.661
<v Speaker 1>People of,</v>

300
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>we had finished his man.</v>

301
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this organized crime thing is a deep thing.</v>

302
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston and it was Whitey Bulger.</v>

303
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>That guy who just got busted.</v>

304
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>He was on the run for like 16 years,</v>

305
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but he ran the Irish mob and you know there was a lot of,</v>

306
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I were trained with a lot of Whitey Bulger's hit men.</v>

307
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever use to have that Boston accent?</v>

308
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:54.884
<v Speaker 1>I had that for awhile.</v>

310
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

311
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.851
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

312
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Exit Man.</v>

313
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty decent.</v>

314
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

315
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:57.861
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

316
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:58.551
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I see a movie,</v>

317
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>so your boss Doug Guy and you want to be look like a Douche bag.</v>

318
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:02.474
<v Speaker 1>It's a great accent.</v>

319
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

320
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I love the sound of the pack.</v>

321
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking car had the fuck out myself on TV.</v>

322
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 1>When I was 19 I was in the bay state games and taekwondo tournament in there.</v>

323
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I heard myself on TV and it was so bad.</v>

324
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

325
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I immediately got rid of the accent and figured out how to get it out.</v>

326
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

327
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I had had it.</v>

328
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I had it.</v>

329
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.033
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty deep.</v>

330
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>We've been working really hard and I was like,</v>

331
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:22.911
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

332
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:23.661
<v Speaker 1>I listen to myself.</v>

333
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:23.901
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

334
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is sort of like a mix between an American and British and</v>

335
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>something else?</v>

336
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange,</v>

337
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.211
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

338
00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

339
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.551
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

340
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

341
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I like movies where they have the Boston accent,</v>

342
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking hot accent to try to replicate.</v>

343
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

344
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>It's people fuck it up all the time.</v>

345
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

346
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:38.091
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

347
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky one.</v>

348
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.421
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting,</v>

349
00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun accent.</v>

350
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a good accent to have.</v>

351
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.011
<v Speaker 1>If you here,</v>

352
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:43.551
<v Speaker 1>if you're out,</v>

353
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're drinking and you're around a bunch of guys at Boston accents,</v>

354
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they're going to be funnier.</v>

355
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>That that's probably the funniest group of humans per capita is Boston men.</v>

356
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

357
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>it's hard life up there,</v>

358
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

359
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.831
<v Speaker 1>Women are ugly.</v>

360
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's cold as fuck.</v>

361
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Women are ugly and Boston monsters really monsters.</v>

362
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.591
<v Speaker 1>Women in Texas,</v>

363
00:09:00.591 --> 00:09:01.424
<v Speaker 1>it's like I said,</v>

364
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not their fault.</v>

365
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It's six.</v>

366
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>This is hot women.</v>

367
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't dealt with the hottest.</v>

368
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Texans have the nicest Americans too.</v>

369
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes us to just really polite and you got it.</v>

370
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.251
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

371
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:11.551
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

372
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you're only dealing with city,</v>

373
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:13.321
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

374

<v Speaker 1>There's a different,</v>

375
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a different Texas chainsaw massacre,</v>

376
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:17.514
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>

377
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to go out into the way you got to go to Jasper where they drag</v>

378
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>black people behind trucks showing it that there's a,</v>

379
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:23.431

384
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:26.634
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

437
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.083
<v Speaker 1>It's like some true,</v>

438
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>even though the repo guy is doing,</v>

439
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>is legal,</v>

440
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:32.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 1>the bank is repossessing its property and the hardest guy to do it.</v>

442
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 1>What the shooter is doing is legal too,</v>

443
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't represent yourself as a repo man.</v>

444
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And even if you did,</v>

445
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.491
<v Speaker 1>even if he did,</v>

446
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.324
<v Speaker 1>he might be able to shoot you.</v>

447
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's not true though,</v>

448
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that if you shoot any true to it,</v>

449
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill them.</v>

450
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

451
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>

452
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:46.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

453
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to shoot him.</v>

454
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

455
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:48.871
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to even shoot.</v>

456
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

457
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no law like it's like a deer.</v>

458
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

459
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me,</v>

460
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I just got you shoot them.</v>

461
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You get to Mike show you killed him.</v>

462
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I can see you for shooting them.</v>

463
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

464
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I bet they could.</v>

465
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

466
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.051
<v Speaker 1>I bet they could.</v>

467
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So not necessarily whether they would win would they could probably take you</v>

468
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:02.094
<v Speaker 1>through the system.</v>

469
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

470
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

471
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you did shoot them and kill them,</v>

472
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't know.</v>

473
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.971
<v Speaker 1>Then they can't see.</v>

474
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:06.781
<v Speaker 1>You obviously know that,</v>

475
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be,</v>

476
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be charged for manslaughter.</v>

477
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

478
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>people who've gotten in trouble in Texas for shooting their wife and boyfriend</v>

479
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and gotten away with it.</v>

480
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

481
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a crime of passion.</v>

483
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:16.861
<v Speaker 1>You come home,</v>

484
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>some guys banging your wife and you fucking shoot him.</v>

485
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

486
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with that.</v>

487
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:20.980
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

488
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>there's some tricky shit that you can get away with Texas.</v>

489
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.841
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

490
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a concealed carry state.</v>

491
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.691
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it is.</v>

492
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're allowed to like go wild west style and have had all</v>

493
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>fucking Holston lister is in some places you're not allowed to do that,</v>

494
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>but you are allowed to carry it out in the open.</v>

495
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you have like a handgun,</v>

496
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you just allowed to hold it out in the open as you walk towards the supermarket.</v>

497
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck man,</v>

498
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>imagine you know you're going to the supermarket and some dude,</v>

500
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just walking with his gun out in the open because that's how the law is.</v>

501
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>The law states that at the sand coming to America,</v>

502
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I admit a care is indeed.</v>

503
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about this whole a Norway thing that just went down with this</v>

504
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:57.791
<v Speaker 1>one guy?</v>

505
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting all the information yet opened up at a camp,</v>

506
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:01.770
<v Speaker 1>a children's cancer,</v>

507
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>a huge amount of children.</v>

508
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how many it's going to be all told cause there's a lot of</v>

509
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>injuries and some of these kids are going to die,</v>

510
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's over 80 kids I believe and know is one of those countries that flies</v>

511
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 1>under the radar.</v>

512
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>And you'd never hear shit from Norway.</v>

513
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Nothing bad ever comes out of nowhere on my buddy Doug.</v>

514
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope just filmed his last DVD there.</v>

515

<v Speaker 1>Oslo where this,</v>

516
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 1>all this happened now and there's one guy,</v>

517
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>some crazy.</v>

518
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 1>All they're saying is he's very religious and you know,</v>

519
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

520
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.491
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

521
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and anti Muslim I believe,</v>

522
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's who knows,</v>

523
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>who knows how much they even know about what the fuck the real situation is.</v>

524
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.391
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

525
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:34.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

527
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>the dust is still settling.</v>

528
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>What a horrible,</v>

529
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>horrible fire hoses this paper to do.</v>

530
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:39.311
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

531
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:39.581
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

532
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>the thing is just being fucking pure evil.</v>

533
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Just you're fucking evil.</v>

534
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:43.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

535
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:44.591
<v Speaker 1>who knows man,</v>

536
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:44.801
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

537
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the,</v>

538
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the man who a shot,</v>

539
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 1>there was a woman who was a congressman shutting the place where the head or</v>

540
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:51.461
<v Speaker 1>whatever?</v>

541
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

542
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>She lived deferred and then,</v>

543
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:53.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>he killed a bunch of people also on the scene.</v>

545
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>That guy had a bunch of videos that he had put on Youtube and written some</v>

546
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>things and it was just,</v>

547
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he was obviously,</v>

548
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 1>his brain wasn't working right.</v>

549
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>He had like his,</v>

550
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 1>like he would make these who say these things are just like would they would</v>

551
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>call word salad?</v>

552
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Just throw a bunch of words together.</v>

553
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:11.920
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense.</v>

554
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Like there was obviously a disconnect if he was,</v>

555
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>it was functioning incorrectly.</v>

556
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

557
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:16.791
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

558
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>the human mind is a very complicated instrument and sometimes it's,</v>

559
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

560
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up and sometimes it's,</v>

561
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.101
<v Speaker 1>it's off.</v>

562
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Just like some people get cancer and some people get diseases,</v>

563
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.990
<v Speaker 1>some people's brains don't.</v>

564
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Some people have some fucking balls watching his TV show with this guy had a</v>

565
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:35.510
<v Speaker 1>fetish for vomit hills quarter.</v>

566
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

567
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

568
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it's off the Greek word for vomit.</v>

569
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I should have asked Irene,</v>

570
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but as a finish of his,</v>

571
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:45.500
<v Speaker 1>and the only way he could get hard was when chicks vomited.</v>

572
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So he wouldn't pay prostitutes to spew on him and vomit.</v>

573
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you went to a restaurant and he saw someone chuck,</v>

574
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 1>he would go and scoop the chuck up and put her in a plastic bag.</v>

575
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And I took the camera inside this giant freezer that he'd stored all these bags</v>

576
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>of vomit from over the years.</v>

577
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And he had each one of the bags like documented,</v>

578
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.450
<v Speaker 1>so he was grabbing a bag off the off.</v>

579
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They were frozen,</v>

580
00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:07.741
<v Speaker 1>frozen.</v>

581
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:08.421
<v Speaker 1>He'd grab it,</v>

582
00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

583
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.590
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

584
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.400
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

585

587
00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.660

588
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.730

589
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.920

<v Speaker 1>So fucking finish for people fucking chucking up and Gil spewing on it.</v>

591
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.070
<v Speaker 1>The only way he could get an erection if a hooker or a friend of his,</v>

592
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 1>would you pay them to stick their fingers down their throat and check up on him?</v>

593
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Why don't,</v>

594
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.520

<v Speaker 1>Like also these dudes,</v>

597
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:37.890

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.520
<v Speaker 1>they called feeders and they feed those fat chicks.</v>

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that feeders?</v>

601
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>There's something on a TV show.</v>

602
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I saw a show again,</v>

603
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.601

<v Speaker 1>10 pounds.</v>

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 1>110 hundred and 20 pounds,</v>

611
00:14:58.521 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

612
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>They have these wives or girlfriends who are fucking behemoths,</v>

613
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:04.210
<v Speaker 1>like 300 pound Emanuel,</v>

614
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Yarbrough looking fucking women who lie in bed all day and immobilized because</v>

615
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:08.931
<v Speaker 1>they're so huge.</v>

616
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Speaker 1>The cat really fucking move and then little men feed and the little men feed</v>

617
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:12.021
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

618
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>They're called feeders and they get off sexually on feeding these women and just</v>

619
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>constantly fucking feeding them and give them these women fucking fat.</v>

620
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I'm surprised.</v>

621
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised.</v>

622
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I would have been surprised if you told me that 20 years ago if you told me that</v>

623
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 1>before I knew about the Internet,</v>

624
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like flat.</v>

625
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.863
<v Speaker 1>They can really,</v>

626
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I would say that doesn't even make any sense.</v>

627
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:30.771
<v Speaker 1>Why would somebody,</v>

628
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and maybe one person's into that,</v>

629
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>this other dude on the show,</v>

630
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>online community on this.</v>

631
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

632
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:35.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

633
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>apparently it's like the,</v>

634
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I won't say a popular thing,</v>

635
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a thing.</v>

636
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 1>There's like a feeder community and fucking skinny dudes are feeding these</v>

637
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>chicks.</v>

638
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Just feeding them constantly sitting by the bedside.</v>

639
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Fucking someone needs.</v>

640
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>When those people become immobile and they can't even leave the house,</v>

641
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 1>who think,</v>

642
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:48.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

643
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the perfect time to go on a diet.</v>

644
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't even move.</v>

645
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.170
<v Speaker 1>How long would it take to starve someone like that to death?</v>

646
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>If you just gave him water,</v>

647
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>they have so much fat.</v>

648
00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Precious.</v>

649
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 1>The fact wouldn't pay for a wall more than a normal person.</v>

650
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You would die of starvation still.</v>

651
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Even if you were there,</v>

652
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that would cause your stomach would start shrinking.</v>

653
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 1>There's extra to happen.</v>

654
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 1>You give them water rights.</v>

655
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.170
<v Speaker 1>They're staying hydrated.</v>

656
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>If you just gave him water and how nobody started building,</v>

658
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

659
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.843
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

660
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to efficient.</v>

661
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can just like use it as an alternative fuel supply,</v>

662
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.221
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

663
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>they're not using up any food for energy because they're just fucking lying</v>

664
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.604
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

665
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>They need some just to pump blood and breathe air.</v>

666
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 1>They need,</v>

667
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>they need some energy.</v>

668
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's possible.</v>

669
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:28.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

670
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

671
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

672
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:29.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

673
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:30.261
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible.</v>

674
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I know you would starve to death even if you're a big fat fuck,</v>

675
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder how many days it would last.</v>

676
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you would last like if you had like a lean guy,</v>

677
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you know like you get like a fucking cow,</v>

678
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 1>King's super athlete,</v>

679
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>lean guy and you put them in a room with some job of the Hautelook and stop them</v>

680
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:44.841
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

681
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:45.621
<v Speaker 1>Who would die first?</v>

682
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Who would die from?</v>

683
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.083
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

684
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You would think the fat guy would have at least a little bit more energy.</v>

685
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 1>How's the little guy fuck the fat chick?</v>

686
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.520
<v Speaker 1>How does everyone find the pussy to probably does?</v>

687
00:16:53.521 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It probably does.</v>

688
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It probably just fucking tosses off beat.</v>

689
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 1>It's somebody who likes him,</v>

690
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you know there's some people out there that are just happy than anybody likes</v>

691
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:00.411
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

692
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 1>They'll take anybody broken.</v>

693
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.523
<v Speaker 1>It's probably doesn't.</v>

694
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.770
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman who died who was like grafted into a couch.</v>

695
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 1>She was slowly,</v>

696
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:13.031
<v Speaker 1>her skin was starting to graft itself to the couch and when they cut her out of</v>

697
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:13.671
<v Speaker 1>the house,</v>

698
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 1>they had cut a hole in the wall to pull her out of the house.</v>

699
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.091
<v Speaker 1>And when they cut her out,</v>

700
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 1>they had to cut her out with the couch.</v>

701
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

702
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>And then she died of complications.</v>

703
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:22.671
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

704
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:23.301
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy,</v>

705
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

706
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

708
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:24.801
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

709
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:25.011
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

710
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:25.491
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

711
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:26.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a broad spectrum.</v>

712
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>People can go off the fucking dignity,</v>

713
00:17:29.091 --> 00:17:29.421
<v Speaker 1>dignity,</v>

714
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>deep end in many different ways.</v>

715
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 1>This other dude on the show had an obsession that he wanted to return to the</v>

716
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>womb.</v>

717
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>

718
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>And he's wife was pregnant and he was jealous of his unborn child for being in</v>

719
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>his wife's womb.</v>

720
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.981
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

721
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:43.351
<v Speaker 1>did his thing,</v>

722
00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>was he,</v>

723
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>he had an obsession with needing to return to the womb.</v>

724

735
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 1>While we live in extreme times and you and I traveled in the most extreme</v>

736
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.191
<v Speaker 1>circles,</v>

737
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:17.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>if you really think about it,</v>

739
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the cage fighting commentary and kickboxing commentary flying all over the world</v>

740
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:24.250
<v Speaker 1>and being around all these savages and,</v>

741
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>and yet we're still shocked by the level of human behavior out there in the</v>

742
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:28.331
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

743

<v Speaker 1>Let's try and use that like I don't get shocked by the volunt knockouts.</v>

744
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I seen the crazy cuts and the blood and the sea,</v>

745
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:38.010
<v Speaker 1>but did you think that when you were in that fight with that dude,</v>

746
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:38.761
<v Speaker 1>that dude was coming out?</v>

750
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 1>though you're not getting in them,</v>

779
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

780
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm told the k one will survive,</v>

781
00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:28.471
<v Speaker 1>but in what capacity?</v>

782
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

783
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Not that it showed Tom will take over,</v>

784
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but it showed time's going to be the one to watch this and Mark Cuban's a bad</v>

785
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:35.454
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

786
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:35.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

788
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Dallas Mavericks brought them along to that title,</v>

789
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 1>owns Hca.</v>

00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 1>And by k one it's probably like 1000 bucks.</v>

792
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You could break by k one for their debt.</v>

793

<v Speaker 1>but the price tag for k one was $30 million.</v>

795
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be less than that now,</v>

796
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.491

799
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.420
