<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>

13
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.770

<v Speaker 2>long sleeve tee shirt.</v>

22
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I could pretty much recite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never felt more liberated than when I </v>

23
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>got rid of all my stuff and I'm in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different country every couple of weeks.</v>

24
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

25
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 2>why not the roller bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

26
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 2>if you travel in any kind of third world</v>
<v Speaker 2>country down cobblestones.</v>

27
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had a roller bag,</v>

28
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:23.260
<v Speaker 2>but I ditched my first trip to London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a change trains like four times going up</v>

29
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 2>and down these damn stairs by the clunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clunk,</v>

30
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 2>clunk back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really sucks.</v>

32
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to carry it on my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

33
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get any money from these guys.</v>

34
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:37.111
<v Speaker 2>But as the tom been fantastic travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags so well configured,</v>

35
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.550

<v Speaker 2>I get in there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you carry around with you everywhere</v>

39

<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Tom Ben,</v>

40
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>is this for hiking or is this just </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily a trap?</v>

41
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a travel ban.</v>

42
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to take a serious hike with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

43
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.960

<v Speaker 2>it looks like it's pretty sturdy,</v>

44
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 2>very sturdy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use packing cubes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you could run further than the person</v>

90
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 2>trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

92
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be like one of these old</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that can't run,</v>

93
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.050
<v Speaker 2>so it comes in handy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

94
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>And this is a little homemade,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

99
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:28.000

<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

104
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.570

<v Speaker 2>but if you would grab that handle and </v>

105
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 2>put weight on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it doesn't move obviously.</v>

106
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's instantly adjustable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

<v Speaker 2>your iphone.</v>

112
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It shows you how to do the API called.</v>

121
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>really interesting what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Going to the UFC and Kettlebell.</v>

127
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a pain in the ass to lug </v>

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>around and you can just in your hotel </v>

<v Speaker 2>Good stuff.</v>

133
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I knew about isometrics back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties when,</v>

134
00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a young wrestler,</v>

135
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 2>a coach use to use a lot of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

136
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.331
<v Speaker 2>that's the workout gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know Bruce Lee was really into </v>

137
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:10.331
<v Speaker 2>isometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

138
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>he was into what they would call dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 2>tension,</v>

139
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Great Charles Atlas,</v>

140
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Charles Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Charles Atlas,</v>

141
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 2>those comic book ads of these to have in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back like becoming a,</v>

142
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 2>you were 98 pound weakling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming like a big stud.</v>

143
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 2>That was like what he was advertised a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of different dynamic tension </v>

144
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 2>exercise for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.960
<v Speaker 2>the father of modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.040
<v Speaker 2>ice metrics was the guy by the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexandra is asked who was a Russian </v>

147
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.791
<v Speaker 2>circus performer and he was traveling </v>
<v Speaker 2>around doing wrestling and bending steel</v>

148
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 2>breaking chains over his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a little guy about my size and</v>

149
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 2>he was captured by the Germans during </v>
<v Speaker 2>World War One and imprisoned and Zass,</v>

150
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to get a little extra food </v>

151
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>because he's worried about losing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>physique.</v>

152
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 2>He offered to train the comma dance dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>for extra food.</v>

153
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.940
<v Speaker 2>So meanwhile he's practicing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>isometrics on the cell bars every day.</v>

154
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>And he eventually bent the bars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>escaped,</v>

155
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.090
<v Speaker 2>went back to the circus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got recaptured this time they put him in</v>

156
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 2>chains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bent the,</v>

157
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>he broke the chains and bent the bars </v>
<v Speaker 2>and escaped.</v>

158
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Not just twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four times.</v>

159
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>He escaped from the Germans bots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all written in his biography.</v>

160
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it has anyone ever wikipedia </v>
<v Speaker 2>this gentleman.</v>

161
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Back then they couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't verify my story,</v>

162
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that this guy was </v>

163
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually an old,</v>

164
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.141
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old black and white youtube of him </v>

<v Speaker 2>She's Alexandra is ass.</v>

166
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Another proponent of isometrics was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fame.</v>

167
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Henry Wittenberg pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up a picture of that guy.</v>

168
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Z Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His biography is a big one.</v>

169
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Probably 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty pounds under 65.</v>

170
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.630

<v Speaker 2>Chains?</v>

171
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started as a kid in the forest.</v>

172
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually went to some right there.</v>

173
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>

174
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 2>When he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was a young boy,</v>

175
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 2>he was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

176
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

177
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lifted beams like that,</v>

178
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beam is really heavy.</v>

179
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>He's got a beam wrapped around his neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his teeth.</v>

180
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

181
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a tif lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a special math piece where he's </v>

182
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>gripping it with his jaws and using his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

183
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how hard to beat to chuck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy out.</v>

184
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that kind of net.</v>

185
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

186
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would been saplings in the forest </v>

187
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>because he couldn't afford steel </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

188
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Speaker 2>And he would ben trees to get his </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength while these guys were the real </v>

189
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>deal back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

190
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>They were a pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny to know supplements,</v>

191
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:51.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no designer whey protein PCA's know </v>

192
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Speaker 2>there was none of this like a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going in a ball like a catabolic.</v>

193
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

194
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>been 15 minutes after my workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they just eat good food and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>

196
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of meat.</v>

197
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>They're also closer to monkeys because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

198
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>it was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

199
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It hadn't evolved yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these,</v>

200
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.570
<v Speaker 1>these people back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also didn't really understand like </v>

201
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>the modern principles of strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

202
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't even think they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

203
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it in a bad way at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

204
00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:28.561
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they necessarily had like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding of all the mechanisms </v>

205
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.670
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just knew you train hard classes,</v>

206
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you get stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>train heart gets stronger.</v>

207
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>This guy knows what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go visit them.</v>

208
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>You can actually buy his book on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty interesting biography.</v>

209
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And I found a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was translated from Russian to </v>

210
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It translates kind of funny.</v>

211
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the confusing things is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>in Russia they use different names for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same person.</v>

213
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So they keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

214
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird man.</v>

215
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And how so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

216
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just called them by four different </v>

217
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

218
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>are they nicknames or nicknames like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie's a,</v>

219
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Ukrainian right.</v>

220
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't they use different names?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately you're off camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not going to be able to hear,</v>

222
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

223
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use different names,</v>

224
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>like little pet pet names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as I'm reading,</v>

225
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking who the hell they talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

226
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm reading back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

227
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.851
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about Alexander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they referred them with four </v>

228
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:32.421
<v Speaker 1>different names in the text and it said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a kind of a weird </v>

229
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>translation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Adley fascinating about his life.</v>

230
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:41.151
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>those old school strongman type </v>

232
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:44.061
<v Speaker 1>characters in because there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were doing things back in </v>

233
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the day like you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always want.</v>

234
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I always bring up the catch wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneer,</v>

235
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:52.090
<v Speaker 1>a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burns' farmer burns who used to do </v>

236
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to hang himself by his neck.</v>

237
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull this up Jamie,</v>

238
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually photos of this guy.</v>

239
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 1>This guy had a neck like my waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he only weighed about 165 pounds and</v>

240
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>he used to drop like a hangman's drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and catch himself by his neck.</v>

241
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:12.141
<v Speaker 1>Look at him here and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actually a baiting heavyweights </v>

242
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:13.160
<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>

243
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>This is a day where I wasn't just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pin,</v>

244
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>but you could do submissions in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>force it.</v>

245
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Got into the shoulders and people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>also tap.</v>

246
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And this is rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough American martial art.</v>

247
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>

248
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.280
<v Speaker 1>what's now known as catch wrestling or </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch as catch can and when you would </v>

249
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.481
<v Speaker 1>get someone into submission to hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would call it a catch and there </v>

250
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:38.331
<v Speaker 1>were a lot of submission holds that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had back in those days that are still </v>

251
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:43.041
<v Speaker 1>super effective today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back over the old rule </v>

252
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:43.041
<v Speaker 1>over old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 1>depictions and old images of submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves from farmer burns,</v>

254
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff that's still completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to.</v>

255
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

256
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually had his original mail order </v>
<v Speaker 1>course back in the day when,</v>

257
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:57.861
<v Speaker 1>as a household or collecting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had his original home </v>

258
00:11:57.861 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>training course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

259
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to keep it in plastic and stuff </v>

260
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

261
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

262
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>A neck crank he's got going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of the old order.</v>

263
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 1>Nelson man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of moves that they had </v>

264
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that they used to use back then that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely effective today.</v>

265
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>But just as Josh Barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

266
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:19.591
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to bring him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really surprised deet and deeds a </v>

267
00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:19.591
<v Speaker 1>hell of a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:24.000
<v Speaker 1>really well trained black out and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think even he was surprised with that </v>

269
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 1>headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He caught them in a scarf hold two,</v>

270
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:28.500
<v Speaker 1>which is like about as old schools that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets lost.</v>

271
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>They get so some of these things are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

272
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Speaker 1>They're new younger guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was coming up the great </v>

273
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.441
<v Speaker 1>and Gracie Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were so many different defenses </v>

274
00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:43.681
<v Speaker 1>against a headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just basically just kinda gave up on </v>

275
00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't practice that stuff,</v>

276
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you get some wrestler or catch wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo guy,</v>

277
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:52.921
<v Speaker 1>some rough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you in one of those headlocks </v>

278
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:52.921
<v Speaker 1>unexpectedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

279
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>He can really hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially a really strong guy.</v>

280
00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:59.721
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>into play a lot is that bulldog choke </v>

281
00:12:59.721 --> 00:12:59.721
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

282
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you rarely see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

283
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 1>like every couple years someone will get</v>
<v Speaker 1>one last one being Raquel Pennington.</v>

284
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Got It on Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan Smith and Ashley.</v>

285
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:10.261
<v Speaker 1>Evan Smith was kind of known as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the grappler in that match up with </v>

286
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:13.271
<v Speaker 1>Raquel Pennington was more of a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she caught her in that bull dog </v>

287
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 1>choker and someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a school yard headlock.</v>

288
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other needs or whatever.</v>

289
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

290
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Right in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is when someone's head is </v>

291
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>here and you get that form under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>choke and you clamp down,</v>

292
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot that guy can do.</v>

293
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot when the head is here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a strong person and you're</v>

294
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>fully locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting on it.</v>

295
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 1>There was not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go right there.</v>

296
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>You see it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to refer to that as the Rodeo </v>

297
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 1>chuck because it's like a cowboy ticking</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a steer on most.</v>

298
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 1>rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really early was a bruce Lee choked out.</v>

301
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:53.371
<v Speaker 1>Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the same game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

302
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 1>game of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite movies.</v>

303
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>He also had the first mma gloves in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

304
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.720
<v Speaker 1>MMA gloves and enter the Dragon.</v>

305
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>The Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

306
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it a.</v>

307
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>was it an opera or was it the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>it was a neck crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they call that?</v>

309
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a crucifix of course effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

310
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

311
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.740
<v Speaker 1>So he was pretty burly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

312
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:22.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean as far as like being open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so far ahead of his time with </v>

314
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:26.911
<v Speaker 1>combining martial arts mean he truly was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original mixed martial artist </v>

315
00:14:26.911 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 1>because in the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even when I was starting out in the</v>

316
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early eighties,</v>

317
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you really weren't supposed to train </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

318
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I would get the stink eye if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go to a boxing gym and try to </v>

319
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>learn some boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.810
<v Speaker 1>they would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my truck window school,</v>

321
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>you basically could learn everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want here.</v>

322
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You didn't need to go anywhere else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely didn't want to learn more </v>

323
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Thai or any of those other techniques.</v>

324
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You just would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's taking time away from your practice</v>

325
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>here and this is what you really need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

326
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's martial arts teachers trying to </v>

327
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>protect their turf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

328
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about losing income.</v>

329
00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 1>If the students are going from this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to the other thing,</v>

330
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>will you see it from even Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructors,</v>

331
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:07.211
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately with Jujitsu instructors </v>
<v Speaker 1>who only trained with the GE start </v>

332
00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:11.171
<v Speaker 1>saying terrible things about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>train Nogi and the reason being is </v>

333
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>because they have too many techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>that rely upon handles on handles.</v>

334
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as they roll with a grappler</v>

335
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

336
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.960
<v Speaker 1>they're going Nogi and they roll with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really good solid college </v>

337
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 1>wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get smoked.</v>

338
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't.</v>

339
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:29.771
<v Speaker 1>They can't deal with someone who's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at manipulating bodies that </v>

340
00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:33.161
<v Speaker 1>are sweaty and with gable grips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooks and under hooks and their use of </v>

341
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 1>those collars and they used to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing sleeves.</v>

342
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole different game and being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>former NCAA division one wrestler I </v>

343
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:42.990
<v Speaker 1>hated that gave for my first three years</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

344
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And then finally as I started getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little old are getting close to my ffts,</v>

345
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I started loving it because it does slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>that game down and completely slows it </v>

346
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.041
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a smaller and weaker you </v>

347
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:57.041
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

348
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>The gate definitely gives you a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to even the odds they're a little bit.</v>

349
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows you to control people.</v>

350
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good about the key is people that</v>

351
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:07.991
<v Speaker 1>live in cold climates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever get in a self defense </v>

352
00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:10.721
<v Speaker 1>situation with some war and a jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a conversation with a friend </v>

353
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:10.820
<v Speaker 1>of mine and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>

354
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 1>if you are in some sort of a street </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with Jujitsu,</v>

355
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>black belt and you have a leather jacket</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

356
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be a dead person </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if that guy just grabs your </v>

357
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.371
<v Speaker 1>collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to do is get inside your </v>

358
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:25.991
<v Speaker 1>collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab a hold of the back of that collar </v>

359
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:25.991
<v Speaker 1>and you're gone.</v>

360
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 1>You're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to just clamp on the other </v>

361
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 1>side and he's going to choke you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

362
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a weapon or it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

363
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always think like,</v>

364
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm like in a straight fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be using all this fancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you got to be the most basic </v>

366
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>stuff you learn as a white belt at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue about to fall back on that stuff.</v>

367
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 1>you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

370
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>like a person who you're fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably is not a trained martial artist</v>

371
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:55.270
<v Speaker 1>know most likely a buddy of mine got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a street fight with a train martial </v>

372
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>artist once he told me that these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

373
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 1>he and this other guy was like yelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>at each other or something on the </v>

374
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.021
<v Speaker 1>highway and they decided to pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they pulled over to the side of the </v>

375
00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:05.021
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

376
00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:08.440
<v Speaker 1>They got out and they started duking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and he threw a leg kick and the guy </v>

377
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.340
<v Speaker 1>checked it and the guy shot for a double</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he stuffed it and they're both </v>

378
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:12.340
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

379
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

380
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:18.671
<v Speaker 1>And they said they went at it for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes and then high fived each </v>

381
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:21.500
<v Speaker 1>other afterwards and got back in the car</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a good outcome.</v>

382
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've realized.</v>

383
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

384
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought another train guy,</v>

385
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.240
<v Speaker 1>they thought they were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each guy thought they were going to get </v>

386
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.240
<v Speaker 1>out and beat the shit out of some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't know what he was doing.</v>

387
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And they both got out and then moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like,</v>

388
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this motherfucker.</v>

389
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And then after awhile they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought it was funny.</v>

390
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I have,</v>

391
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I have used digital jobs in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the street straight back when I had </v>

392
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>my school in Philadelphia.</v>

393
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when crazy people would come into town </v>

394
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.690
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we had jim fights but a couple of </v>

395
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:52.690
<v Speaker 1>times even on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 1>just crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

397
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Had a cab driver tried to run me over </v>
<v Speaker 1>one time and I was furious.</v>

398
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

399
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I used to commute by bike quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

400
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.600
<v Speaker 1>when I went by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so mad I,</v>

401
00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:06.601
<v Speaker 1>I hit this out of his cab and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gave him a couple of my express my </v>

402
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:13.551
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy pulls over and jumps </v>

403
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:13.551
<v Speaker 1>out of the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

404
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.320
<v Speaker 1>there's coming at me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:20.321
<v Speaker 1>I just used the inside control and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid him over the top of the cab and it </v>

406
00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 1>was over before it started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave up and just got back in.</v>

407
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 1>But thank God for basic standups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self defense also.</v>

408
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for him that you're a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

409
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sort of smash his face in nowadays,</v>

410
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:35.961
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smashed someone's face and you're </v>

411
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:35.961
<v Speaker 1>going to have all sorts of lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking on the door.</v>

412
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because was always a video of it.</v>

413
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Now in the word disguises bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go out of the house with like</v>

414
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:42.690
<v Speaker 1>a mascot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

415
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

416
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It must be tough to wear mustaches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

417
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

418
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Street self defense is like la obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>last alternative,</v>

419
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.920
<v Speaker 1>like you would most likely never use any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the techniques that you learn if </v>

420
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.901
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky you could live your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and never used any martial arts if </v>

421
00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:02.901
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's luck.</v>

422
00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

423
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

424
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally like to run,</v>

425
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 1>not because I think running is such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good workout.</v>

426
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I like to run for the skill of running </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't run,</v>

427
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not good at running.</v>

428
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

429
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I do it more as a martial art because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>

430
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you run,</v>

431
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't run,</v>

432
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the way most people move.</v>

433
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 1>mid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

435
00:19:28.801 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>70 year old guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I practice sprints at least once,</v>

437
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:37.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes twice a week just for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill of being able to run fast.</v>

438
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Sprints are really good for your system </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

439
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in,</v>

440
00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it can be systemic was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>it was a real interesting study done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

442
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>They found that people that run in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone that like do 10 ks,</v>

443
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>five k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.320
<v Speaker 1>competitive running marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlons,</v>

445
00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 1>and such actually a shorter life </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy than people that don't run at</v>

446
00:19:57.241 --> 00:20:02.241
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was really surprised they claim </v>

447
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:02.241
<v Speaker 1>it's the oxidative stress.</v>

448
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 1>My theory is people don't use the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus properly embraced properly.</v>

449
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 1>They found that people that lived all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them were the people that run real slow,</v>

450
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.850
<v Speaker 1>just nice measurably like zen running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They they live longest.</v>

451
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.290
<v Speaker 1>They live longest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

452
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.530
<v Speaker 1>if you ever heard of the theory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a certain amount of </v>

453
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:21.530
<v Speaker 1>heartbeats that you get in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have heard that.</v>

454
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a kind of almost makes sense.</v>

455
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the age of professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

456
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.860
<v Speaker 1>like how they die young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burn,</v>

457
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they flame out in time pretty young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you have been </v>

459
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.721
<v Speaker 1>really a pioneer in avoiding like </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping your body healthy like deep into</v>

460
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>your sixties and seventies and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a whole program about that,</v>

461
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 1>about with Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has.</v>

462
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it just it for a lifetime.</v>

463
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.880
<v Speaker 1>We're actually going to do a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>April in Maui.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would like to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

468
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard.</v>

469
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just tell these guys,</v>

470
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:08.101
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just taking a week off and gone to </v>

471
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Maui is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to,</v>

472
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like my time off is most of the </v>

473
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>time if I actually have actual time off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent it with my family.</v>

474
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring your wife,</v>

475
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 1>bring your wife and you're a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>diving.</v>

476
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can take a paddleboard lessons </v>

477
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>while you come up and paddle board </v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>

478
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

479
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 1>always nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

480
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm there somebody gets bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a shark.</v>

481
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't know what the fuck is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have that big fear.</v>

482
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Ever since I saw that movie jaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

483
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>forget at bed while we're there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching TV.</v>

484
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And there was a newscast a about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid who got his leg mauled and uh,</v>

485
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids were just in the pool or just in</v>

486
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

487
00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the ocean rather that day we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>snorkeling.</v>

488
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And then we came back and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this thing about the surfer who</v>

489
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>just got mangled and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had them all stitched up and he was</v>

490
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:57.250
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a primal fear.</v>

491
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's irrational because my chance</v>

492
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:04.640
<v Speaker 1>of being eaten by a shark is way less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than being an accident in a car.</v>

493
00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I rent cars and drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always say that,</v>

495
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make me feel any better</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the also,</v>

496
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 1>the odds of you being eaten by a shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the shore,</v>

497
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.610
<v Speaker 1>radically decreased.</v>

498
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever go to the ocean,</v>

499
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 1>there's zero ads increase when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water.</v>

500
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't go in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't get bit by a shark.</v>

501
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.640
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go to the,</v>

502
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a sunset beach,</v>

503
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe is what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just south of La.</v>

504
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to show me?</v>

505
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Reaches the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seal it.</v>

506
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

507
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:42.661
<v Speaker 1>Going back right off a Huntington beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

508
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.280
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is one big ass shark.</v>

509
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.320
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be bigger than eight feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it just randomly caught it </v>

510
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>because they were doing some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

511
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>so he was filming something else and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing just breached the water.</v>

512
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show that again.</v>

513
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine the fucking size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing?</v>

514
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big shark.</v>

515
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not a seven foot shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine some kid on a surf board and</v>

516
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 1>it just comes up underneath there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they stunned as seals.</v>

517
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:16.621
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever watched sharks hunt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they hit and knock it kind of </v>

518
00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:21.030
<v Speaker 1>unconscious most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then did you ever see the film that </v>

519
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.241
<v Speaker 1>they put the that they got off of right </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of fisherman's wharf in San </v>

520
00:23:24.241 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some tourists were out there and they </v>

521
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 1>were just filming the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pictures of each other and seeing</v>

522
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>all these people hanging around by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water's edge and a great wife.</v>

523
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this seal up in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

524
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.980
<v Speaker 1>like right in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we think it was probably two </v>

525
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.011
<v Speaker 1>different seals that are killed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it killed one and there was just like </v>

526
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>this big bloody puddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it like,</v>

527
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 1>it got ahold of a second one.</v>

528
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just looking at the surface of </v>

529
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.921
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but massive red and I mean these people </v>

530
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:56.881
<v Speaker 1>are 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 feet away from this thing as it's </v>

531
00:23:56.881 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 1>tearing the Sila part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really pretty crazy.</v>

532
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.340
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an awesome picture of a,</v>

533
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 1>a Orca hunting with his calf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great white.</v>

534
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

535
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

536
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:10.050
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stunted and use Jujitsu.</v>

537
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically grabbed and turned it over.</v>

538
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And if sharks don't keep moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically dropped,</v>

539
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 1>held it till it basically drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at eight,</v>

540
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 1>it's liver and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

541
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that analyze the video,</v>

542
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that the mother a orco was teaching</v>

543
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:26.580
<v Speaker 1>the baby how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 1>how to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to kill a shark.</v>

545
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

546
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.470
<v Speaker 1>They're not nearly as agile as an Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere near as smart.</v>

547
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really dumb.</v>

548
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 1>They have a tiny brain that just eat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim around.</v>

549
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

550
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>because when you see that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

551
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:46.540
<v Speaker 1>when he flip it up upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about flipping a shark upside </v>

552
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>down also kinda like knocks it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 1>They just go passive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people actually do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>like in shows and stuff where they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just take and just flip it and rub.</v>

556
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bizarre.</v>

557
00:24:55.431 --> 00:25:00.431
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of weird like flaws in</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's early designs and it's almost like</v>

558
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the designs like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the design of a shark.</v>

559
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to keep swimming.</v>

560
00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

561
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 1>here's that footage off of San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 1>is though,</v>

562
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 1>this is a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

563
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it so close?</v>

564
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a little bit later into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it got closer,</v>

565
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it starts off a little farther away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

566
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

567
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Now let's go further with them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the further away you get to see it back </v>

568
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 1>it up from the beginning because you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this isn't the one though,</v>

569
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

570
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one.</v>

571
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 1>It's from a distance and you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the shark.</v>

572
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 1>The rkv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

573
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 1>which one is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

574
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:38.300
<v Speaker 1>He's just a shark attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the shark eating seal.</v>

575
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 1>This is right off of fisherman's wharf </v>
<v Speaker 1>where all the restaurants are.</v>

576
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:43.070
<v Speaker 1>People are walking around.</v>

577
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

578
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So more than one.</v>

579
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:52.811
<v Speaker 1>Great white too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more than one footage of </v>

580
00:25:52.811 --> 00:25:56.171
<v Speaker 1>this apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is a big deal and </v>

581
00:25:56.171 --> 00:25:56.171
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a phone too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be watching this.</v>

582
00:25:56.171 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean these look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

583
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty feet asked Brittany and chance,</v>

584
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

585
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a better footage though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different angle,</v>

586
00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:08.351
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit further off where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually see the shark breach the </v>

587
00:26:08.351 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 1>water with a seal and it's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

588
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll stay on shore.</v>

589
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

591
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>five different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy swam from Alcatraz to shore,</v>

592
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am i.</v>

593
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 1>One of my heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacquelyn lane used to swim that while </v>

594
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 1>pulling a boat full of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

595
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Shackled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

596
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 1>and like as an annual birthday event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a man.</v>

597
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the guy was still doing all sorts</v>

598
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>of crazy exercises right up into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

599
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a crazy man who really a real </v>

600
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 1>pioneer of health and fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health wellness and juicing</v>

601
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.030
<v Speaker 2>and he got into Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

602
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I always tell these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.890
<v Speaker 2>don't be listened to these trainers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their twenties to thirties or even their</v>

604
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>forties because they haven't been over </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the other side.</v>

605
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

606
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

607
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 2>they just don't have that longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

608
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 2>All my mentors were guys in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

609
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.850
<v Speaker 2>They're the guys I want to learn from </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that went to the other side that </v>

610
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>are super fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really healthy.</v>

611
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

612
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 2>they're the guys I've been looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.820
<v Speaker 2>to put my own program together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to listen to these young </v>

614
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no fucking idea,</v>

615
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

616
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I was a lot of the shit I did when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in my forties and even early </v>

617
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.840
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at him.</v>

618
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were people he would tow,</v>

619
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 2>not just a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tow seven boats or something crazy.</v>

620
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean like 70 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

621
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I think he told like a person for every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year of his life.</v>

622
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So here he's towing like a whole stream </v>
<v Speaker 2>of boats,</v>

623
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>like how many boats were back there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was an amazing swimmer.</v>

624
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:47.810
<v Speaker 2>That water was cold and it doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me like he has a wetsuit on it.</v>

625
00:27:47.811 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he may just have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singlet type.</v>

626
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like there's a wetsuit.</v>

627
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 2>It's harder though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way the savage.</v>

628
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.360
<v Speaker 2>That guy was amazing fitness guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is and he's handcuffed.</v>

629
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Here's a guy that stood the test of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

631
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 2>He had gone to his eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>

632
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Another guy was a master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elliot Gracie.</v>

633
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I made that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had a Jujitsu with a lesson </v>

634
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 2>with the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>when he was in his late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

636
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.440
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

637
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to beat anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

638
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:29.331
<v Speaker 2>Doing competitive just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't want to go up and mess </v>

639
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:29.331
<v Speaker 2>with that old guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

640
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would mess you up.</v>

641
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.610
<v Speaker 2>He had some thick ass hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big hands,</v>

642
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 2>big forearms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

643
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

644
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:40.251
<v Speaker 2>he would just slap it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to hate to be the guy that he </v>

645
00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:41.490
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated stuff on because he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just really put it on you.</v>

646
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I felt damn near injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

647
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he was a pioneer of no holds barred</v>

648
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 2>fights like way back in the day.</v>

649
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing that in the 19 forties,</v>

650
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 2>And even before him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his teacher,</v>

652
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 2>he didn't learn directly for those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brothers did.</v>

653
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I was that guy a salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Ada,</v>

654
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 2>a little Japanese guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

655
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard he won over 800.</v>

656
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>No holds barred fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether that's true or not.</v>

657
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Hicks and $400 dollars </v>

658
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

659
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.170
<v Speaker 2>But made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did,</v>

660
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200
<v Speaker 2>he did a lot of no hold bar type type </v>
<v Speaker 2>deals and he was one of the guys that </v>

661
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really developed that a guard because he</v>

662
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>was finding that big American wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and football players,</v>

663
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting them on his back and he </v>

664
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:29.900
<v Speaker 2>became deadly from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

665
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.400
<v Speaker 2>from fighting from his bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of specialized in that </v>

666
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>particular position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating because that was a</v>

667
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 2>big part of [inaudible] game too with </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping himself.</v>

668
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was like 140 plus</v>

669
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when he was competing and fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>against much larger man,</v>

670
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.310
<v Speaker 1>much larger guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived with them for a month down in </v>

671
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.700
<v Speaker 1>his ranch and tears office and I used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get daily lessons and his favorite thing</v>

672
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 1>was to have you put himself into just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad position,</v>

673
00:29:56.621 --> 00:30:01.621
<v Speaker 1>like mad or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just basically defy you to do </v>

674
00:30:01.621 --> 00:30:01.621
<v Speaker 1>anything to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

675
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a great game that you can play well</v>
<v Speaker 1>into advanced age.</v>

676
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:09.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just let the kids work on you a </v>

677
00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>little bit and just play defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was nothing I could do.</v>

678
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

679
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically knew everything I was going</v>

680
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:14.900
<v Speaker 1>to do before I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

681
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>he'd give his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.080
<v Speaker 1>let's let him out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

683
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 1>he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his defense was just a superb.</v>

684
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.100
<v Speaker 1>You would have either had to use an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual amount of strength or do </v>

685
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 1>anything or I made.</v>

686
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.860
<v Speaker 1>There was no full one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

687
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but it may just put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will Hixon you select guys start on his </v>

688
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 1>back with a full rear naked choke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully locked in.</v>

689
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 1>That's how he would start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>

690
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could develop that kind of </v>

691
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.170
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if you're safe from there,</v>

692
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you say from everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big parts of Jujitsu,</v>

693
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you'll agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ability to be safe in any </v>

694
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.291
<v Speaker 1>position and the ability to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to be safe in those </v>

695
00:30:52.291 --> 00:30:56.011
<v Speaker 1>positions and the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Eddie Bravo did that when he was </v>

696
00:30:56.011 --> 00:30:59.191
<v Speaker 1>training for or one of the big things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he did was he had people start off </v>

697
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:03.121
<v Speaker 1>in bad positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have people start off mounting </v>

698
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:03.121
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people start off in side control.</v>

699
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:05.010
<v Speaker 1>He never started out just facing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.330
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're two equal neutral position.</v>

701
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Every position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every role started with him on his back.</v>

702
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Every role started with him in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised position is such a great way</v>

703
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.530
<v Speaker 1>to work if you're working with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have the same skill sets as </v>

704
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

705
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Hickson was in America for years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years and he only had white </v>

706
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.671
<v Speaker 1>bell blue about level guys to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the way he kept his sword </v>

707
00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:33.871
<v Speaker 1>sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would put himself in these bad </v>

708
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:33.871
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially closed triangles,</v>

709
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe a parsley closed Omoplata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

710
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:42.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the back with a maybe a partially </v>

711
00:31:42.031 --> 00:31:44.581
<v Speaker 1>closed choke or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just was just a genius as </v>

712
00:31:44.581 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 1>getting out of those positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you can show your training </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners what to do,</v>

714
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you can actually make it more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself,</v>

715
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>for you tell them what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

716
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And I mean Hixon didn't just develop his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own Jiu Jitsu skills.</v>

717
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he had a lot of great students</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

718
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a black belt under Hixon to this </v>

719
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most prestigious black.</v>

720
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Seems a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

721
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably the closest thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get to Hickson is a so radio and</v>

722
00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:16.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's unbelievable training with </v>

723
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:18.431
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about law school </v>

724
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:20.161
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luis gave me my very first private </v>

725
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:20.161
<v Speaker 1>lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

726
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 1>add Hickson's old place on Pico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was before I didn't know that there</v>

727
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:23.680
<v Speaker 1>was a difference in the gracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>when I was starting out and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

729
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 1>this is Gracie Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

730
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>This is just like the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who's Hixon Gracie?</v>

731
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the brother didn't even know that</v>

732
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 1>he was the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Carlson gracie school was closer.</v>

733
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It was off Hawthorne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right off sunset.</v>

734
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:43.540
<v Speaker 1>That was closer to where I lived by like</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and you know,</v>

735
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>especially during traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a nightmare to get down to pico.</v>

736
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

737
00:32:47.561 --> 00:32:52.561
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go to this place instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I fucked up and stopped training at </v>

738
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 1>like the best place in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't even know,</v>

739
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it was when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

740
00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a clue how well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just didn't appreciate how,</v>

742
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 1>how good these guys were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I got lucky though.</v>

743
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Any given day I could have a lesson with</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the brothers.</v>

744
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.310
<v Speaker 1>They were one big happy family and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were always there too.</v>

745
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky though that when I came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlson's,</v>

746
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Mario Sperry was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

747
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Carlos by head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toe was there.</v>

748
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch those guys roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch those guys compete.</v>

749
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Vito Belfort was there and it was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was calling,</v>

750
00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:27.590
<v Speaker 1>they were calling him victor Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

751
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>

752
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would spell it with a k,</v>

753
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what happened.</v>

754
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 1>They changed his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand what happened.</v>

755
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know in Brazil a lot of times the </v>

756
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.491
<v Speaker 1>women are able to keep their original </v>
<v Speaker 1>name so they don't always take the name </v>

757
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:43.860
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their husbands.</v>

758
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taking Carlson's name.</v>

759
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

760
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belford is his real name.</v>

761
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have like a gracie </v>

762
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.831
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was taking mother than might have </v>

763
00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:56.831
<v Speaker 1>been a gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

764
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but there's some people that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doesn't,</v>

765
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.290
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

766
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Who has that going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela Gracie know someone.</v>

767
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Someone has that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the men.</v>

768
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Has that going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Gracie,</v>

769
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.650
<v Speaker 1>his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Roger is what?</v>

770
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.970
<v Speaker 1>His father's Gomez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

771
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:17.410
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:34:17.411 --> 00:34:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

773
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So I think Caesar to Caesar have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar situations,</v>

774
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.220
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

775
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know it's not uncommon for the,</v>

776
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 1>a married woman to keep her maiden name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

777
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

778
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:38.351
<v Speaker 1>so like I used to see everybody called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vittorio Victor back then.</v>

779
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And like if you look at the early UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I even call it.</v>

780
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember someone pulled me aside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

781
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't call him Victor Gracie at UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

782
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't call him gracie because Horian</v>
<v Speaker 1>was suing Carlson.</v>

783
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

784
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Like Horian was suing all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie's they couldn't even use their </v>

785
00:34:59.830 --> 00:34:59.830
<v Speaker 1>last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

786
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.301
<v Speaker 1>Carlson Gracie is a legend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real legend in Brazilian Jujitsu </v>

787
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was the guy who came in and beat </v>

788
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 1>the guys that Leo couldn't beat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawson was a bigger,</v>

789
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 1>tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger guy.</v>

790
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was more of a bulldog </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

791
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.810
<v Speaker 1>which is why it was perfect that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pretty much to bridge the gap </v>

792
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.730
<v Speaker 1>between Ellias young sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Elliot was getting a little up there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

794
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was starting to fail physically a </v>

795
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.050
<v Speaker 1>bit and his own sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a little bit too young still,</v>

796
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 1>so call us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call us,</v>

797
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and Greg was like the one to defend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family honor up until the point where a </v>

798
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Hickson and halls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie</v>

799
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.160
<v Speaker 2>got into the young man and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic group of students.</v>

800
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:45.400
<v Speaker 2>It was an unbelievable teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little boost.</v>

801
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Montay Mario Sperry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had some really amazing,</v>

802
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 2>amazing students as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ability to go out and recruit talent</v>

803
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:54.860
<v Speaker 2>was just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

804
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.900
<v Speaker 2>he just knew how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an eye for guys that were going </v>

805
00:35:59.900 --> 00:35:59.900
<v Speaker 2>to be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

806
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.041
<v Speaker 2>He also had like a great family </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment like that Carlson Gracie </v>

807
00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:04.041
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were very tight knit.</v>

808
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It said it's a fascinating time in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of martial arts.</v>

809
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:12.861
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties and what happened to </v>

810
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:16.491
<v Speaker 2>this [inaudible] Jitsu in America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it just sort of exploded and change </v>

811
00:36:16.491 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 2>the face of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really did.</v>

812
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I had my first experience in 89 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just made up my mind.</v>

813
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to learn it.</v>

814
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I went in as a NCAA division one </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

815
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I had a really good record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

816
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:36:30.441 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like most wrestlers kind of hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardheaded.</v>

818
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Why do these skinny Brazilian guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to show me,</v>

819
00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm,</v>

820
00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm tapped like a typewriter by Heuler </v>
<v Speaker 2>and black hole.</v>

821
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this that he's doing to me?</v>

822
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

823
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I asked Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I learn this martial art?</v>

824
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out to torrance is the only game in</v>

825
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 2>town at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was true.</v>

826
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.130
<v Speaker 2>And I see you went from philly all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to tour and train and I would stay </v>

827
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.130
<v Speaker 2>for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have so much money.</v>

829
00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I was a former school teacher and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little retirement accounts set </v>

830
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 2>some money set aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 2>after I quit teaching and money I set.</v>

833
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.710
<v Speaker 2>So I use that to fund by Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

834
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 2>The meantime I had opened up my exercise</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a personal training gym.</v>

835
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I put some mats in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 2>and I would usually go and take like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand bucks and when I run out of </v>

837
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 2>money I would go back to philly again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says it was my business,</v>

838
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I could just take off whenever I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

839
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

840
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Then I had matt it and it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym of eastern seaboard.</v>

841
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I would just get all my old friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Judo Club,</v>

842
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Quito.</v>

843
00:37:33.361 --> 00:37:38.361
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go in there and just work with </v>

844
00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:38.880
<v Speaker 2>these guys and practice my Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another,</v>

845
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple months later I go back and </v>

846
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.040
<v Speaker 2>spend time again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I got smart.</v>

847
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I started bringing the gracies to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and then they would stay with me,</v>

848
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 2>stay with me sometimes for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

849
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Hoist actually lived with me for a month</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time.</v>

850
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Well I think boys in oil or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know how schools anymore.</v>

851
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:59.210
<v Speaker 2>They just traveling to seminars and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>find that that's more lucrative and they</v>

852
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>get away from the hassle of having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay rent and employees and all the other</v>

853
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>nonsense that comes with schools and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

854
00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:08.370
<v Speaker 2>they're just welcomed with open arms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these weekend seminars.</v>

855
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a guy like hoists are heuler or Hixon</v>

856
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:13.620
<v Speaker 2>wants to do a seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who's gonna say no going to say,</v>

857
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what I do to myself.</v>

858
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go around and show him the </v>

859
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 2>gracies up the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

860
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that I'm really into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days is just basically how can you</v>

861
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:25.770
<v Speaker 2>keep your body still in the game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean,</v>

862
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 2>it is fun to roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

863
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you can do into </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced age,</v>

864
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but you got to be careful and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be very careful with the preparation </v>

865
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>of your body and what are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are</v>

866
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.070
<v Speaker 1>the keys to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

867
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering into their older age,</v>

868
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:44.600
<v Speaker 1>what are the keys to maintaining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body's inelasticity,</v>

869
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.630
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

870
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your strength and vitality.</v>

871
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main cases,</v>

872
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>joint mobility every single day you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do some type of mobility.</v>

873
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 1>People get confused between flexibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mobility.</v>

874
00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Mobility has a connotation of strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to voluntarily go in</v>

875
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>and out of the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a given example,</v>

876
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 1>a bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

877
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.250
<v Speaker 1>a grapple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Stryker,</v>

878
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I've seen your devastating kick spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>round house thing.</v>

879
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You do a one way that like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between mobility,</v>

880
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:17.641
<v Speaker 1>like splash a buddy would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be doing a split or put your </v>

881
00:39:17.641 --> 00:39:18.720
<v Speaker 1>foot up on elevated surface and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding it and stretching,</v>

882
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That flexibility,</v>

883
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but lifting your leg up slowly under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and extending it out and holding</v>

884
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it like the old Bruce Lee movie.</v>

885
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 1>And that is mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

886
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving through the full range movement </v>

887
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.420
<v Speaker 1>regularly is extremely good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joints ache,</v>

888
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you keep your ability to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other advice I have these young,</v>

889
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>these guys out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tap early and tap off and don't be a </v>

890
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.661
<v Speaker 1>fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this whole concept that you can't </v>

891
00:39:51.661 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 1>tap to a lower belt that gets so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys hurt.</v>

892
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many purple bouts </v>
<v Speaker 1>or brown bouts get really pod because </v>

893
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 1>some really big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong or technical blue bag gets him in</v>

894
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:06.001
<v Speaker 1>a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel they can't tap and they'll </v>

895
00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:06.001
<v Speaker 1>literally risk injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

896
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't saying why in the heroin </v>

897
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.081
<v Speaker 1>fortunate [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that ever started that </v>

898
00:40:13.081 --> 00:40:13.081
<v Speaker 1>you can tap to Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

899
00:40:13.081 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the problem is if you feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping,</v>

900
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get injured,</v>

901
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel so much worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much worse,</v>

902
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to take you so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer to recover.</v>

903
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.240
<v Speaker 1>You like if you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody catches you in and you're </v>

904
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>

905
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.240
<v Speaker 1>this is tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

906
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Let me just tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

907
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did I get caught in that?</v>

908
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That feeling that you get is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

909
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you because that way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

910
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't just let your neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out there.</v>

911
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:40.951
<v Speaker 1>You can't not defend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't think about those potential </v>

912
00:40:40.951 --> 00:40:43.501
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see in a lot of Jujitsu </v>

913
00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:46.711
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see when when a higher belt will go </v>

914
00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>with a very enthusiastic and the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitious lower belt,</v>

915
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.800
<v Speaker 1>they oftentimes disregard the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility getting tapped and that's </v>

916
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 1>how they get tapped bore as some higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>belts I've seen.</v>

917
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:03.420
<v Speaker 1>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll roll with a purple belt or a </v>

918
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.671
<v Speaker 1>blue belt or a wipe out and they'll roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everybody like that person's a </v>

919
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:05.671
<v Speaker 1>Ninja.</v>

920
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So we'll roll with every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single person like that person is </v>

921
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.691
<v Speaker 1>like the greatest grappler that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever faced in their life and if they do </v>

922
00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:15.091
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking about like going hard and </v>

923
00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:15.091
<v Speaker 1>being like really physical and hurting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

924
00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but being aware of all the possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being on your toes and being at 10 </v>

925
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.190
<v Speaker 1>at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

926
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.220
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fine or purposely </v>
<v Speaker 1>just put yourself in danger positions </v>

927
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

928
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 1>just to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I think,</v>

930
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a horrendous boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 1>either a henry here on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

932
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

933
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:36.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

934
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>they mentioned a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy that worked in their school,</v>

935
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:43.721
<v Speaker 1>a blackboard in his fifties who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a down in the dumps over been </v>

936
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>haven't been roughed up by a bull boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying,</v>

937
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old was the pool about,</v>

938
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy was like in his twenties and</v>

939
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:56.591
<v Speaker 1>he outweighed by about 30 pounds and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they were the ones who came up </v>

940
00:41:56.591 --> 00:42:00.191
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that like for every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of age and for every 10 pounds of </v>

941
00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the guy having an extra belt</v>

942
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>

943
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So if he knows how to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

944
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 1>just a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say a big,</v>

945
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 1>strong athletic white belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 years old,</v>

946
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe outweighs me by 40 pounds.</v>

947
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be like me fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

948
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a much higher skill level.</v>

949
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.320
<v Speaker 1>What he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he lacks in skill and technique </v>

950
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 1>he's making up for with Hustle and youth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know he's not going to get tired</v>

951
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>and strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

952
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:32.441
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's very dangerous to roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people that are much larger than </v>

953
00:42:32.441 --> 00:42:32.441
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

954
00:42:32.441 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I think there's lessons to be learned in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I certainly did my share of it,</v>

955
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times Rowan,</v>

956
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:42.221
<v Speaker 1>with much larger guards would come off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your neck is fucked up or your back </v>

957
00:42:42.221 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>is cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making weird noises.</v>

958
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

959
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>is this really worth it?</v>

960
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Or rarely really tactical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

961
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's really,</v>

962
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>really technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's completely different.</v>

963
00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:56.831
<v Speaker 1>But if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could roll with you and we could have </v>

964
00:42:56.831 --> 00:42:56.831
<v Speaker 1>a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to try to kill me,</v>

965
00:42:56.831 --> 00:42:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't try to crush me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's sweet being taught,</v>

966
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart big guy.</v>

967
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 1>If he's rolling with the smaller guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an older guy,</v>

968
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.860
<v Speaker 1>he's going to put himself on the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

969
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Now that you swayed me or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just practices defense in the bottom,</v>

970
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 1>why would re way rather roll with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger than me black belt?</v>

971
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Then I would have larger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purple Belt.</v>

972
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good point.</v>

973
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just.</v>

974
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.320
<v Speaker 1>It also like if you roll with a larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you black belt,</v>

975
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:23.450
<v Speaker 1>like a or grace or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anything to prove.</v>

976
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

977
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Like they've also been doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole life.</v>

978
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They know how to do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get away with so much with </v>

979
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 1>physical strength and explosiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

980
00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and just wait and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make you any better.</v>

981
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people,</v>

982
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 1>if you want to learn Jujitsu properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn it from a little guy from a little</v>

983
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:45.970
<v Speaker 1>guy learning from like a Barrett Yoshida</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a boiler,</v>

984
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Gracie or an Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you learn Jujitsu from a smaller </v>

985
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.191
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn like really </v>

986
00:43:54.191 --> 00:43:54.191
<v Speaker 1>technical Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>master Leo.</v>

987
00:43:54.191 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 1>His self defense still stands the test </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

988
00:43:56.271 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

989
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:02.170
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that makes me </v>

990
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 1>really pleased to see that it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone full circle.</v>

991
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu was kind of going the way of a </v>

992
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.111
<v Speaker 1>lot of other martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like judo became like just a form of </v>

993
00:44:11.111 --> 00:44:11.111
<v Speaker 1>jacketed wrestling really.</v>

994
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo tank,</v>

995
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.130
<v Speaker 1>pseudo that they were at one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly martial arts,</v>

996
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

997
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.790
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the bars,</v>

998
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.170
<v Speaker 1>furnaces has been lost in a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

999
00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if they go Olympic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was happening to Jujitsu,</v>

1000
00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just basically shaking hands </v>

1001
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 1>and jumping on their ass and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1002
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's a fun game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1004
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:40.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm not driving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the guys are not </v>

1005
00:44:40.971 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 1>formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Athletes are amazing,</v>

1006
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the average guy,</v>

1007
00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to be really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1008
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:49.881
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to be so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it for fun I think is </v>

1009
00:44:49.881 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 1>important that you back yourself up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self defense.</v>

1010
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And I see now a big trend to going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the origins of Jujitsu.</v>

1011
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 1>The self defense has been really big.</v>

1012
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Guys want to know the basic standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>street defense and it was extremely well</v>

1013
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:04.640
<v Speaker 1>developed in the old Brazilian Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1014
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It was very well developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun knife stick club,</v>

1015
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of clenches.</v>

1016
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Defend yourself against the gods trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ground and pound.</v>

1017
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It was all there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was lost.</v>

1018
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.100
<v Speaker 1>It was last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1019
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 1>it is unfortunate when people were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to chase metals and win by points</v>

1020
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:26.931
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so the they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely unrealistic in the actual </v>

1021
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 1>application against a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight or a fight or rather a who knows</v>

1022
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:36.531
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's really </v>

1023
00:45:36.531 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 1>exciting right now is I'm Nogi </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

1024
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And what Eddie Bravo is done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see Eddie Bravo invitation,</v>

1026
00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:42.900
<v Speaker 1>which was number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was yesterday now,</v>

1027
00:45:42.901 --> 00:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>but I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about.</v>

1028
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I heard some of the results in it.</v>

1029
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a very good way to contest </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill versus skill.</v>

1030
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1031
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 1>What Eddie's done is he's figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to.</v>

1032
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 1>They have it's submission only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they go after it.</v>

1033
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but when it reaches a time limit,</v>

1034
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 1>if it reaches a time limit and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no submission,</v>

1035
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 1>then what they do is they start off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised positions sorta like </v>

1036
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1037
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 1>in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy would start down,</v>

1038
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.101
<v Speaker 1>one raise position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in you have the option of two </v>

1039
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you take the back with over,</v>

1040
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 1>under just over under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a choke locked in,</v>

1041
00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:19.941
<v Speaker 1>but just the back with the hooks in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>over under or spiderweb control meaning </v>

1042
00:46:19.941 --> 00:46:20.220
<v Speaker 1>a arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy,</v>

1043
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the guy's defending the arm bar on it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying on his back.</v>

1044
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 1>You're inside control and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm hooked and your legs are crossed and</v>

1045
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you start from there.</v>

1046
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And so either the person gets a tap or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person on the bottom escapes the </v>

1047
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 1>position and then you count up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>

1048
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So you do it in like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's three rounds of this and</v>

1049
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.910
<v Speaker 1>if someone taps than the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an opportunity to tap that to the </v>

1050
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:50.661
<v Speaker 1>person and whoever taps the quickest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if one person taps the person </v>

1051
00:46:50.661 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 1>within a minute and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person does it in 30 seconds,</v>

1052
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that person with the 32nd person would </v>
<v Speaker 1>win and if there's no taps in the,</v>

1053
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's three rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three rounds of,</v>

1054
00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:02.760
<v Speaker 1>of the submission attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they count up the amount of time it</v>

1055
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 1>took the person to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if one person escapes like 30 seconds</v>

1056
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:08.370
<v Speaker 1>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>then the other person that person would </v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

1058
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how Gary Tone and wound up losing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

1059
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 1>What a fair way to do it.</v>

1060
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a smart way to do it too because it</v>

1061
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:21.021
<v Speaker 1>ensures that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting situations because if two guys </v>

1062
00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:25.071
<v Speaker 1>are just locked up in front of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and no one ever gets to a bad </v>

1063
00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:25.071
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to see any action.</v>

1064
00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But if a guy's on a guy's back and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an over under and they start from </v>

1065
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a dangerous spot.</v>

1066
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And so you're going to see exciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1067
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:37.530
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes grappling from being this </v>

1068
00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>thing that can really wanting to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>polaris,</v>

1069
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had those matches.</v>

1070
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:43.480
<v Speaker 1>What Gary Tonin versus some are Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>Horez great matchup,</v>

1071
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>but it went to a draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 1>a j last name winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want a clear cut winner.</v>

1073
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Plus it gives athletes a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>showcase their skills.</v>

1074
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people want to say.</v>

1075
00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.060
<v Speaker 1>They want to see the skill sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>showcased and you don't get to see that </v>

1076
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes these guys are so damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>good that they neutralize each other.</v>

1077
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always make for a great fight</v>

1078
00:48:07.571 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 1>to really good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1079
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 1>what you've seen this in the UFC many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times you think,</v>

1080
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna be so good.</v>

1081
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1082
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:19.771
<v Speaker 1>this is really boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the guys just basically </v>

1083
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:19.771
<v Speaker 1>neutralize each other because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just so good.</v>

1084
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 1>They're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cancel each other out.</v>

1085
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 1>They can't switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a.</v>

1086
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:27.871
<v Speaker 1>That is a problem and I think Eddie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with the perfect solution with </v>

1087
00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>this format of putting guys in bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions in the last stage of the match</v>

1088
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and like a fun thing to compete it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's excellent.</v>

1089
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's on fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's on UFC fight pass.</v>

1090
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
<v Speaker 1>So now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people getting a chance to see </v>

1091
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 1>it and they put the videos on Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that child is at the pro level.</v>

1092
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty $5,000</v>

1094
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 1>for the might be kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they just did like a grass roots,</v>

1095
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:51.720
<v Speaker 1>then a grassroots thing just for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1096
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.760
<v Speaker 1>amateurs to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be great program about purple </v>

1097
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Speaker 1>bound a brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how agree.</v>

1098
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the logistics of a tournament like </v>

1099
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Bay.</v>

1100
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:02.690
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you it'd be fun to compete in.</v>

1101
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's done six of them and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten better and better and yesterday's</v>

1102
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:09.730
<v Speaker 1>was the biggest one and especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's on fight pass now,</v>

1103
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but he's really figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's figured out how to make this </v>

1104
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.050
<v Speaker 1>exciting thing to watch where people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were on the outside looking in.</v>

1105
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of that cast wrestling,</v>

1106
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:24.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't realize that pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war and just post civil war </v>

1107
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.840
<v Speaker 1>wrestling was the most popular sport in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1108
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People used to sit outside the telegraph</v>

1109
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:33.991
<v Speaker 1>offices to listen to the results of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these old school wrestling </v>

1110
00:49:33.991 --> 00:49:34.660
<v Speaker 1>matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way more popular.</v>

1111
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1112
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.650
<v Speaker 1>baseball was in its infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a civil war era sport that </v>

1113
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.401
<v Speaker 1>was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A basketball was still only like two </v>

1114
00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:47.881
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're playing it and they </v>

1115
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 1>actually used real like peach baskets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1116
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1117
00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a physical education guy came up </v>

1118
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:54.830
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way just to,</v>

1119
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:54.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a game.</v>

1120
00:49:54.901 --> 00:49:59.901
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a conditioning game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the origins of basketball to </v>

1121
00:49:59.901 --> 00:50:02.840
<v Speaker 1>football was Lakers and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I was like this big watermelon</v>

1122
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 1>and welcome ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wrestling was the most popular sport</v>

1123
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was real wrestling though.</v>

1124
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:13.681
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like catch guys like Georges </v>

1125
00:50:13.681 --> 00:50:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Hacking Schmidt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Gosh,</v>

1126
00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:19.030
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer burns and you know,</v>

1127
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 1>even up to the Arabs triangle to Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:26.860
<v Speaker 1>they were still doing real wrestling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course they started getting into</v>

1129
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 1>more of the entertainment business.</v>

1130
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 1>How did it go bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's really fascinating to me </v>

1131
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.121
<v Speaker 1>that wrestling itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an unbelievably difficult </v>

1132
00:50:37.121 --> 00:50:40.961
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you watch amateur wrestling in </v>

1133
00:50:40.961 --> 00:50:43.601
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics or Olympic level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably difficult and it's </v>

1134
00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:47.591
<v Speaker 1>exciting and fun to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no professional venue for </v>

1135
00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:51.881
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The appropriate well until the UFC came </v>

1136
00:50:51.881 --> 00:50:51.881
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1137
00:50:51.881 --> 00:50:54.521
<v Speaker 1>But that's fighting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for people who just want to </v>

1138
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:54.521
<v Speaker 1>wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't.</v>

1139
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It is a great basis though for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

1140
00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it,</v>

1141
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks that there's not a professional</v>

1142
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 1>avenue for actual wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual arresting.</v>

1143
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on television,</v>

1144
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.980
<v Speaker 1>golf or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this massive professional venue </v>

1145
00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.851
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like Eddie Bravo that was </v>

1146
00:51:15.851 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 1>given one for Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is obviously very different than</v>

1147
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just wrestling itself,</v>

1148
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.920
<v Speaker 1>getting the pin and scoring points for </v>
<v Speaker 1>take downs and all those different </v>

1149
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:23.920
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1150
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's something to be said for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a sport.</v>

1151
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not the best as a martial arts for</v>
<v Speaker 1>completing a fight,</v>

1152
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:35.021
<v Speaker 1>for finishing a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with the rules that are </v>

1153
00:51:35.021 --> 00:51:37.421
<v Speaker 1>involved in amateur wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me the guys who get really great </v>

1154
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:41.831
<v Speaker 1>at wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would like to see them have a </v>

1155
00:51:41.831 --> 00:51:44.861
<v Speaker 1>professional avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a way to go from college and then </v>

1156
00:51:44.861 --> 00:51:49.001
<v Speaker 1>compete as a professional wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now there's anything wrong with </v>

1157
00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:53.021
<v Speaker 1>wwe if you're into that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would love it if it was an actual </v>

1158
00:51:53.021 --> 00:51:53.370
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 1>actual real honest to God not </v>
<v Speaker 1>choreographed,</v>

1160
00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 1>nothing thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>

1161
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:03.731
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an attempt for awhile to </v>

1162
00:52:03.731 --> 00:52:03.731
<v Speaker 1>actually come up with a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

1163
00:52:03.731 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Couple temps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:09.041
<v Speaker 1>But it kind of fell by the wayside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if that was the case </v>

1165
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:12.011
<v Speaker 1>with basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you play basketball in college and </v>

1166
00:52:12.011 --> 00:52:14.030
<v Speaker 1>basketballs is like really like people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched on espn is this big deals in the</v>

1167
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Olympics and basketball.</v>

1168
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 1>But then when you went to pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had a dress like a vampire you</v>

1169
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>through glitter onto the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1170
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you have music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you introduce you,</v>

1171
00:52:22.061 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>you have matches in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like,</v>

1172
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:28.781
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck happened in basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some countries where they </v>

1173
00:52:28.781 --> 00:52:32.501
<v Speaker 1>actually do have rail pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on basic,</v>

1174
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:34.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1175
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 1>not essentially Olympic roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1176
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1177
00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each,</v>

1178
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 1>each country has their own little native</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial art folk style wrestling.</v>

1179
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the African countries do this.</v>

1180
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's huge.</v>

1181
00:52:47.891 --> 00:52:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And in countries like Somalia and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1182
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:55.750
<v Speaker 1>what was the other country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met this guy that travels the world </v>

1183
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.880
<v Speaker 1>for the International Olympic Wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Federation and he,</v>

1184
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:03.881
<v Speaker 1>he was just doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just looking at all the different </v>

1185
00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:05.540
<v Speaker 1>aspects of wrestling all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him when I was in Turkey.</v>

1186
00:53:05.541 --> 00:53:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Turkish national </v>
<v Speaker 1>championships of oil wrestling.</v>

1187
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 1>These guys are all pretty much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional level dudes,</v>

1188
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:14.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1189
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:19.270
<v Speaker 1>this is the one where they were these </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo hide trousers that are tied off </v>

1190
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:22.961
<v Speaker 1>at the knee and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically just pour a bucket of </v>

1191
00:53:22.961 --> 00:53:25.991
<v Speaker 1>olive oil over themselves and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out in a grass arena and they just </v>

1192
00:53:25.991 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 1>wrestle</v>

1193
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 2>and it starts out with like 50 dudes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1194
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 2>half of those guys lose and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep going to like two guys </v>

1195
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 2>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Why oil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

1197
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 2>How did that go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>During the Ottoman Empire?</v>

1198
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:43.641
<v Speaker 2>They had a standing army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basically the Ottomans pretty much </v>

1199
00:53:43.641 --> 00:53:46.760
<v Speaker 2>conquered the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had all these young soldiers </v>

1200
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.920
<v Speaker 2>with nothing to do and these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>

1201
00:53:47.921 --> 00:53:48.800
<v Speaker 2>It's the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1202
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 2>you got to keep young men occupied so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they came up with this.</v>

1203
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1204
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:59.030
<v Speaker 2>these are ferocious warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the you don't want your guys hurting </v>

1205
00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they came up with this idea of coated</v>

1206
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:02.490
<v Speaker 2>themselves with oil to make himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>slippery.</v>

1207
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.860
<v Speaker 2>So you can go after each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 2>like a rabid dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one really gets hurt.</v>

1209
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it helps build t charts because</v>

1210
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>these guys were wearing armor and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking desert,</v>

1211
00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of degrees,</v>

1212
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:21.770
<v Speaker 2>100 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it really builds up a tremendous </v>

1213
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.770
<v Speaker 2>heat tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 2>when you get used to training like that.</v>

1215
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 2>So training covered with oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat tolerance can skin,</v>

1216
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:27.240
<v Speaker 2>can't breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1217
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1218
00:54:29.371 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that way.</v>

1219
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:35.420
<v Speaker 2>So like you just like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your pores really can't sweat that good </v>

1220
00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 2>hope and those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were able to keep themselves in</v>

1221
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 2>tremendous shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work on his technique.</v>

1222
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they do is reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the pants and grabbed that whole </v>

1223
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>and it looks a little gay I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you something.</v>

1224
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I actually put on the kiss but in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>

1225
00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:57.000
<v Speaker 2>And I wrestled with the former junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>national champ.</v>

1226
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was almost breaking my ribs with the,</v>

1227
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 2>with the lever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1228
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.340
<v Speaker 2>he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He come inside the waistband of your </v>

1229
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:06.340
<v Speaker 2>trousers and put his elbow in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>spine.</v>

1230
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.000
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the idea is to flip the guy over and</v>

1231
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 2>expose your belly button to the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you turn the guy over,</v>

1232
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 2>you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had with the guy on the bottom.</v>

1233
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 2>This is a terrible look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks a little Cherub.</v>

1234
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.540
<v Speaker 2>He's like literally waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it this way,</v>

1235
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 2>would never fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never fly in America.</v>

1236
00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the,</v>

1237
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.440
<v Speaker 2>why is there a gap between the waste and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1238
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the body.</v>

1239
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't start that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this really tight?</v>

1240
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:37.221
<v Speaker 2>But the oil over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these guys are unbelievably strong </v>

1241
00:55:37.221 --> 00:55:38.480
<v Speaker 2>and you can see the physiques and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are like,</v>

1242
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they are national heroes.</v>

1243
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:46.581
<v Speaker 2>They're rock stars in their country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're grabbing each other's </v>

1244
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:46.581
<v Speaker 2>packages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1245
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:46.581
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1246
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:47.460
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sexuality at all,</v>

1247
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way you can get your hand</v>

1248
00:55:51.121 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Speaker 2>deep in there like that and not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some shenanigans.</v>

1249
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>He's looking at his friend and going my </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole hand.</v>

1250
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.030
<v Speaker 2>You see how he's holding the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.750
<v Speaker 2>the leg and the pant that's used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage to flip the guy over.</v>

1252
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:09.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like Jujitsu in a way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making sure that the guy can't get </v>

1253
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.600
<v Speaker 2>away while he's got his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1254
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it,</v>

1255
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.980
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you man,</v>

1256
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have this.</v>

1257
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I developed a keen respect for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1258
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:18.910
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1259
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys are definitely fly in a western </v>

1260
00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:23.940
<v Speaker 2>culture now.</v>

1261
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But you've done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are strict Islam as to you </v>

1262
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.971
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and any kind of homosexuality is </v>

1263
00:56:32.971 --> 00:56:32.971
<v Speaker 1>punishable by death of these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1264
00:56:32.971 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 1>But you also know that that doesn't stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1265
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Like people that have gone over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan have talked about men love </v>

1266
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:41.611
<v Speaker 1>Mondays or whatever the fuck they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there where there's a lot of the </v>

1267
00:56:41.611 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 1>mab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man boy love.</v>

1268
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no super common.</v>

1269
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have gay relationships.</v>

1270
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Like there was an article that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about one of those gay websites,</v>

1271
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an APP,</v>

1272
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:57.721
<v Speaker 1>like a grinder or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this guy went over to some </v>

1273
00:56:57.721 --> 00:57:01.830
<v Speaker 1>forbidden country where some Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and fired up the APP and it was </v>

1274
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:06.931
<v Speaker 1>just getting pinged left and right by </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these gay dudes and trying to hook </v>

1275
00:57:06.931 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>up your data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's forbidden fruit,</v>

1276
00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1277
00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.340
<v Speaker 1>How it is.</v>

1278
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll get up and put on a buffalo hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wrestle,</v>

1279
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's about as good as it gets for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1280
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but if you were gay you'd be psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was.</v>

1282
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were gay and somebody like </v>

1283
00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:27.150
<v Speaker 1>put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1284
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Being a heterosexual man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a girl wanted to get all lubed up and</v>

1285
00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Russell and you could stick your hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>down her pants,</v>

1286
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.080
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there.</v>

1287
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So matter of fact,</v>

1288
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:42.421
<v Speaker 1>after the show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with a tarp?</v>

1289
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1290
00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lay it down.</v>

1291
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Grab the rollout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vat,</v>

1292
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the VAT of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a Lulu lemon tights on those.</v>

1293
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pants look like they're sturdy.</v>

1294
00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:56.530
<v Speaker 1>At least it looks like it's difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1295
00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It took me 15 minutes to get them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1296
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 1>There are so stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stand up by themselves.</v>

1297
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.440
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I literally had to oil up my balls </v>

1298
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thighs just slot in that thing man.</v>

1299
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things.</v>

1300
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1301
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 1>This is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a waste track.</v>

1302
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 1>He's actually grabbing the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like grabbing the Jujitsu belt,</v>

1303
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what you call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to pull them down into a,</v>

1304
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:22.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a takedown.</v>

1305
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It's called a cock holster in my world </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

1306
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Look at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1307
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>

1308
00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.790
<v Speaker 1>that is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's lucky he didn't break his neck,</v>

1309
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1310
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1311
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure when you're dealing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>being real slippery like that,</v>

1312
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem with actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling with this.</v>

1313
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's my friend.</v>

1314
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the version of like in prison,</v>

1315
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:46.270
<v Speaker 1>they hold onto your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

1316
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.870
<v Speaker 1>These guys looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

1317
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Girls will do unto us to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying in my country</v>

1318
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:56.800
<v Speaker 1>there no girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just throw it down,</v>

1319
00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1320
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 1>it is a very difficult way to grapple </v>
<v Speaker 1>all jokes aside.</v>

1321
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>

1322
00:59:03.491 --> 00:59:08.491
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop like you learn that </v>

1323
00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:10.400
<v Speaker 1>about Nogi as well and especially if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to do Nogi with no shirts on.</v>

1324
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big difference with bobby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like crazy.</v>

1325
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1326
00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:20.220
<v Speaker 1>the thing also about that was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very safe for the soldiers to go </v>

1327
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:20.680
<v Speaker 1>full at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1328
00:59:20.681 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with a standing army with</v>
<v Speaker 1>no war to fight?</v>

1329
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with the ball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

1330
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have him hurting each other.</v>

1331
00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:33.840
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the so called origins of the </v>

1332
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:33.840
<v Speaker 1>whole sport.</v>

1333
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an NPR podcast on radio lab </v>

1334
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 1>about the origins of football and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>football was created and that was one of</v>

1335
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:45.221
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why it was so appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a way to compete in war </v>

1336
00:59:45.221 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 1>without actually having war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had objectives,</v>

1337
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:51.890
<v Speaker 1>you have goals and instead of bullets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bodies got a football team wrestling</v>

1338
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:53.430
<v Speaker 1>most sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way like if you think of the,</v>

1340
00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say the rugby scrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like the old shield wall,</v>

1341
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:01.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1342
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>When they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they formed the shield wall.</v>

1343
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically learning to work </v>

1344
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1345
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is grappling.</v>

1346
01:00:10.891 --> 01:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You mean you're basically throwing guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>down pretty hard to.</v>

1347
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever you have young men and </v>

1348
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you have competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1349
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be this desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dominate.</v>

1350
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Like young men always want to dominate </v>
<v Speaker 1>other men.</v>

1351
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That's just always going to be the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1352
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:31.331
<v Speaker 1>So they figured a way to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>workarounds that are acceptable by </v>

1353
01:00:31.331 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>society and then in fact it became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest port in the country.</v>

1354
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean team warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the NFL is the biggest sport in the</v>

1355
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1356
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting is the early football </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1357
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't see the injuries like </v>

1358
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made there would be elbows,</v>

1359
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders like,</v>

1360
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like all tough boy sports where </v>

1361
01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you're throwing people to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hurt,</v>

1362
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't get the concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the theories I had one.</v>

1363
01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And you don't see it in rugby or rugby </v>
<v Speaker 1>union or Gaelic football or in that you </v>

1364
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>don't see it as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as much,</v>

1365
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>but you do definitely do see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>

1366
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an epidemic.</v>

1367
01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:09.881
<v Speaker 1>Like in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the helmet became a weapon and </v>

1368
01:01:09.881 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>they start using the head as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1370
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>to see what the NFL does now with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>all of these lawsuits and all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these injuries.</v>

1372
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you happen to see a will Smith in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie?</v>

1373
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Concussion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concussion?</v>

1374
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1375
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:29.981
<v Speaker 1>but I keep hearing great things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie out because I heard he was a </v>

1376
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>hell of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1377
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they can do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate it,</v>

1378
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>but they do have a new kind of helmet </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1379
01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:40.091
<v Speaker 1>I heard that that just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really reduces the sloshing of the </v>

1380
01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't do that.</v>

1381
01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's some kind of gel or </v>

1382
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>something in the helmet that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a soft kind of thing.</v>

1383
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>The team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absorption,</v>

1384
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the helmets for.</v>

1385
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So when he get hit your brain's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>sloshes.</v>

1386
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1387
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get hit with headgear a lot,</v>

1388
01:01:55.430 --> 01:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really stop the brain and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take more hits because there's no </v>

1389
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that,</v>

1390
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:05.951
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>accentuates the movement of the brain </v>

1391
01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>because the fulcrum effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fulcrum of they have someone with</v>

1392
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>his larger object and the head twists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe they've take.</v>

1393
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new helmet now that supposedly</v>

1394
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>is gel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes the blow,</v>

1395
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>but it saves the.</v>

1396
01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing in here.</v>

1397
01:02:21.391 --> 01:02:26.391
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy pulled up this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says zero one believes it can reduce </v>

1398
01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:27.900
<v Speaker 3>the chances of player sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>concussion,</v>

1399
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.260
<v Speaker 3>and this is interesting because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the helmet itself sort of gibbs and </v>

1400
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 3>expands.</v>

1401
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see that happen because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I love pro football and I would be </v>

1402
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:45.321
<v Speaker 2>thrilled to see it that they come out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that these guys can still play the </v>

1403
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:48.960
<v Speaker 2>game without suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's horrible injuries.</v>

1404
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but honestly I feel like the real option</v>

1405
01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:57.250
<v Speaker 3>is probably no pads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No helmet was the same thing with mma or</v>

1406
01:02:57.251 --> 01:02:59.890
<v Speaker 3>like the original football in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1407
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:04.930
<v Speaker 3>I think with mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that saves fighters </v>

1408
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:08.340
<v Speaker 3>versus boxing is that you really can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>tee off on someone the way you can with </v>

1409
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.090
<v Speaker 3>boxing gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with boxing gloves,</v>

1410
01:03:10.091 --> 01:03:13.570
<v Speaker 3>you almost can have no concern whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not you're going to hit a forehead or</v>

1411
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.570
<v Speaker 3>going to hit an elbow unless you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>small hands or we can.</v>

1412
01:03:16.571 --> 01:03:17.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1413
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:21.670
<v Speaker 3>it's much more rare that boxers break </v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands and MMA fighters.</v>

1414
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:26.910
<v Speaker 3>But even MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have an unrealistic amount </v>

1415
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.900
<v Speaker 3>of protection on their hands and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to protect their hands.</v>

1416
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get interviews.</v>

1417
01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I got interviewed after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1418
01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy died overseas really recently </v>

1419
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that they maybe should have</v>

1420
01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:42.040
<v Speaker 3>bigger gloves or maybe we should make </v>
<v Speaker 3>people wear head gear?</v>

1421
01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.160
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the real answer is no gloves,</v>

1422
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 3>not only no gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no risk taping because I think that one </v>

1423
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:54.241
<v Speaker 3>of the more difficult aspects about </v>
<v Speaker 3>punching someone is that your wrist </v>

1424
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:56.680
<v Speaker 3>joint moves when you hit things and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it way harder.</v>

1425
01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to really concentrate to keep </v>

1426
01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:03.631
<v Speaker 3>your fist completely tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that your risk doesn't move </v>

1427
01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:07.500
<v Speaker 3>when you make impact and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make impact with the first two knuckles </v>

1428
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you could break your hand and</v>

1429
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.500
<v Speaker 2>regional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

1430
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Say I was one of the original vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you this.</v>

1431
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through my little bit of money in there </v>

1432
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.421
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was voices a conditioning coach for </v>

1433
01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 2>those first three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you have him do back then?</v>

1434
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I was actually trying to build his </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength as much as I could because </v>

1435
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu provided all of the conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he needed.</v>

1436
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a lot of work with just </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing in fresh partners and he wanted</v>

1437
01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:35.490
<v Speaker 2>to stay a Jujitsu purist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>

1438
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used some kicks and so forth just to </v>

1439
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Kinda close the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just closed the distance.</v>

1440
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:45.381
<v Speaker 2>Faith the guy I make the make the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder like what's he doing so that he </v>

1441
01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 2>could get the clients and so he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>smack guys to,</v>

1442
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:51.530
<v Speaker 2>to open that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't run the risk of breaking your </v>

1443
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:54.231
<v Speaker 2>hand in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in all those original UFC is the </v>

1444
01:04:54.231 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>strikers all busted their hands a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversight.</v>

1445
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I think three broken hands in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1446
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.030
<v Speaker 2>that the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's realistic though,</v>

1447
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's realistic and ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound would cease to exist.</v>

1448
01:05:03.211 --> 01:05:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just sit there and tee off.</v>

1449
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:08.050
<v Speaker 2>We can elbow people for sure just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

1450
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:13.280
<v Speaker 2>but imagine hitting someone in the elbow</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your store at the top of the head </v>

1451
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and so that that whole ground and pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing would pretty much go away.</v>

1452
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 2>We'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reckless punching</v>

1453
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.340
<v Speaker 3>would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have precision </v>

1454
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:23.560
<v Speaker 3>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see a lot more open hand strikes.</v>

1455
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>You would see a grab was able to secure </v>
<v Speaker 3>a holds if they can hold.</v>

1456
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be a boring for the subway </v>

1457
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>because I think you would see grapplers </v>
<v Speaker 3>when a lot of fights you might,</v>

1458
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 3>but I think you would also see a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>better Moitai.</v>

1459
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.010
<v Speaker 3>You would see people would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop their Moitai because you don't.</v>

1460
01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:43.810
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't see any change in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>

1461
01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 3>the knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kicks,</v>

1462
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 3>the elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all would be exactly the same.</v>

1463
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Speaker 3>The only difference would be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches,</v>

1464
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 3>so I think really high level Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner,</v>

1465
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:58.441
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably have a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage if they can keep the fight on </v>

1467
01:05:58.441 --> 01:05:58.441
<v Speaker 3>the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the fight went to the ground,</v>

1468
01:05:58.441 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 3>you definitely see a big advantage for </v>
<v Speaker 3>grapplers,</v>

1469
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:02.620
<v Speaker 3>especially in securing chokes because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've tried,</v>

1470
01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure to do grapple with MMA gloves </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1471
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just like wearing oven mitts or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1472
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Especially like rear naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you try to get a rear naked choke and</v>

1473
01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's really hard to get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath the chin and so and </v>

1474
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 3>especially if you like pretzel grips or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1475
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:21.541
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much you create a good solid </v>

1476
01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:25.950
<v Speaker 3>two to three extra inches of space that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want with all the padding on </v>

1477
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 3>the gloves and it just gets in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>

1478
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:29.980
<v Speaker 3>it's easy for your opponent to grab them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pull them.</v>

1479
01:06:29.981 --> 01:06:34.981
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while I'd love to see a return to </v>

1480
01:06:34.981 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 3>the glove was mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1481
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:41.370
<v Speaker 3>it would be really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see a leg somewhere where </v>

1482
01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe on an Indian reservation or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someplace where they didn't have all the</v>

1483
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 3>boxing is the reason why they put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves on the first place.</v>

1484
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The boxing commissions all one.</v>

1485
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Well actually it was tanking habit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1486
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.310
<v Speaker 3>tank Abbott was the first guy to wear </v>
<v Speaker 3>those gloves.</v>

1487
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Tank Abbott War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chuck Norris MMA gloves,</v>

1488
01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 3>which was before anybody had them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was tank.</v>

1489
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Wore them like I want to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>

1490
01:07:04.481 --> 01:07:09.481
<v Speaker 3>It was like early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early UFC because tank was a power </v>

1491
01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:10.750
<v Speaker 3>puncher and he was smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

1492
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just taped my hands up,</v>

1493
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 3>put these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these small padded gloves on.</v>

1494
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:19.480
<v Speaker 3>They're going to protect my knuckles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just molly these dudes was that.</v>

1495
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Was that before they went to the club </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank?</v>

1496
01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Abbott was before they went through </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves.</v>

1497
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.810
<v Speaker 3>The first UFC that I worked at didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gloves.</v>

1498
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 3>I was at UFC 12 and they still didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gloves,</v>

1499
01:07:28.751 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 3>did not have gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not mandatory.</v>

1500
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.490
<v Speaker 3>It was optional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vituro wore gloves,</v>

1501
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he also wore shoes.</v>

1502
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't wear him and those guys were </v>

1503
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:41.520
<v Speaker 3>still wearing leslie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was barefoot.</v>

1504
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 3>He wore when he fought vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's him versus Tara.</v>

1505
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Tara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all leg has no gloves but tank has </v>

1506
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:49.650
<v Speaker 3>gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1507
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tank was,</v>

1508
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure a tank was the pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wearing those kind of gloves and I </v>

1509
01:07:55.890 --> 01:08:00.541
<v Speaker 3>think that they would call those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they called them mma </v>

1510
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 3>gloves back to him because I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the term mma,</v>

1511
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.420
<v Speaker 3>but the original gloves were century </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves,</v>

1512
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:09.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>central martial arts come from hitting </v>

1513
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.470
<v Speaker 3>the heavy bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed bag or something like that.</v>

1514
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what the design came from.</v>

1515
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Like the design of MMA gloves didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>come from someone sitting down and </v>

1516
01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:20.441
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need the perfect glove for mixed </v>

1517
01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:20.441
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they had.</v>

1518
01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:23.680
<v Speaker 3>They already had a model that was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really necessarily designed for MMA </v>

1519
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 3>and they just sort of applied into mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it became the standard.</v>

1520
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of like really sloppy shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in mma still to this day.</v>

1521
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.860
<v Speaker 3>That shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's only in there because it was in </v>

1522
01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:35.860
<v Speaker 3>there in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 12 to six elbow,</v>

1523
01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:40.601
<v Speaker 3>which I harp upon all the time because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's so stupid that if you go down</v>

1524
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 3>from 12:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>to six on the clock with an elbow,</v>

1525
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you hit someone on the thigh,</v>

1526
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:51.490
<v Speaker 3>which is so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal and the reason why it's </v>

1527
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:55.061
<v Speaker 3>illegal is because the commissions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the athletic commission saw people </v>

1528
01:08:55.061 --> 01:08:58.151
<v Speaker 3>breaking bricks on those karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrations that you can't do that </v>

1529
01:08:58.151 --> 01:09:00.170
<v Speaker 3>you would kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why that's illegal.</v>

1530
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.540
<v Speaker 3>That understanding of that they weaken </v>
<v Speaker 3>those breaks.</v>

1531
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the reason why gloves are </v>

1532
01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:10.931
<v Speaker 3>mandatory is because somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>they erroneously believed those gloves </v>

1533
01:09:10.931 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 3>protective the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

1534
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.070
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>

1535
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:15.050
<v Speaker 3>But knowing that knowing that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1536
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I think if we got a room full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes and fighters and martial </v>

1537
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 3>artists and we all have the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we said let's just have a show of hands.</v>

1538
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:25.980
<v Speaker 3>How many guys here think that the gloves</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect the opponent?</v>

1539
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 3>So everyone who knows everyone at 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

1540
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I think across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1541
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:36.550
<v Speaker 3>there might be a contrary enter to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would step in and say,</v>

1542
01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a personally I'd rather get punched by a</v>

1543
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 3>guy with a glove that no glove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people would say fuck that.</v>

1544
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Most people would say bare knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably safer for everybody.</v>

1545
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1546
01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Involves effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1547
01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.650
<v Speaker 1>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I correct?</v>

1548
01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Did they not take the headgear off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic box?</v>

1549
01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:52.300
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did,</v>

1550
01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:53.860
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good move.</v>

1551
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you don't get hit as much when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you not have headgear on.</v>

1552
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I used to hate headgear sparring because</v>
<v Speaker 1>your peripheral would get screwed up,</v>

1553
01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 1>especially kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really dangerous because,</v>

1554
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get hit with a jab and you </v>

1555
01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.021
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even recognize the kick was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming because of they're coming over </v>

1556
01:10:13.021 --> 01:10:13.870
<v Speaker 1>your shoulder until womp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's catching the side of the head.</v>

1557
01:10:13.871 --> 01:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It was your peripheral would get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

1558
01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:20.851
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would close your peripheral quite a </v>

1559
01:10:20.851 --> 01:10:22.861
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just always felt like I got hit </v>

1560
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:22.861
<v Speaker 1>way more when I had head gear on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1561
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:27.571
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of boxing and that I did </v>

1562
01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:31.501
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always noticed I always kinda had a </v>

1563
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>dull headache after boxing with headgear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I didn't have the headgear,</v>

1564
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that same headache.</v>

1565
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even back then,</v>

1566
01:10:36.911 --> 01:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I could never understand why my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>always hurt more after boxing with the,</v>

1567
01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.870
<v Speaker 1>with the headgear on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your brain's squishing around.</v>

1568
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1569
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>but I mean at the time I didn't put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause and effect together.</v>

1570
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1571
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1572
01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>all I knew was intuitively I hated </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing headgear when I,</v>

1573
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.680
<v Speaker 1>when I would train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1574
01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:58.740
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've brought up this to people in </v>

1575
01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.470
<v Speaker 1>high places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have the same thing.</v>

1576
01:10:59.471 --> 01:11:02.020
<v Speaker 1>The public would never go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The public would think it's too brutal.</v>

1577
01:11:02.021 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 1>People would think it's too brutal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1578
01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:04.500
<v Speaker 1>what if we</v>

1579
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 3>created what if we created because we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>created something,</v>

1580
01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1581
01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:09.240
<v Speaker 3>not me obviously didn't have anything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with it,</v>

1582
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what MMA is,</v>

1583
01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 3>is we have a completely new sport over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last few decades and this completely</v>

1584
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 3>new sport is redefined the way people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about combat sports and fighting.</v>

1585
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1586
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Well why don't we be honest about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

1587
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.350
<v Speaker 3>what's happening and why don't we be </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest about like,</v>

1588
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Speaker 3>how come you can shin kick a guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face?</v>

1589
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I can shin you in the face full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't punch you with a bare </v>

1590
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how stupid that is?</v>

1591
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Because a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1592
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:37.760
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1593
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.650
<v Speaker 3>someone who's a power kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Vito Belfort or something.</v>

1594
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.220
<v Speaker 3>The amount of power they could generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a kicked in that brush into your </v>

1595
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:51.051
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much more than anyone can ever </v>

1596
01:11:51.051 --> 01:11:51.051
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>

1597
01:11:51.051 --> 01:11:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean like multitudes more three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically it is a baseball bat,</v>

1598
01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have to wear Shin Pads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can we not enough to wear Shin Pads?</v>

1599
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Because the public's not used to shins </v>
<v Speaker 3>being covered,</v>

1600
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>it's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1601
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I really honestly think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartest move would be to ban tape.</v>

1602
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tape your wrists and bare </v>

1603
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:10.700
<v Speaker 3>knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think such A.</v>

1604
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back in the early era of </v>

1605
01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 3>boxing where it was all bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rarely saw knockouts.</v>

1606
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.960
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's fights used to go.</v>

1607
01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:22.920
<v Speaker 3>So like 30 rounds of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1608
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:27.921
<v Speaker 3>like Jack Johnson and those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's why they used to </v>

1609
01:12:27.921 --> 01:12:28.650
<v Speaker 3>fight like this to smack each other with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knuckles like that?</v>

1610
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Or do you think they just didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>any better?</v>

1611
01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I think they know better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1612
01:12:32.001 --> 01:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1613
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:34.740
<v Speaker 3>the mighty men of old.</v>

1614
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 3>There's not too much we could probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>show those guys.</v>

1615
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we went in at a time capsule </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to Sparta,</v>

1616
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.170
<v Speaker 3>the first professional army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in Europe.</v>

1617
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we could actually show </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys anything about fighting or </v>

1618
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:48.880
<v Speaker 3>warfare and fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those dudes up.</v>

1619
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Send me back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1620
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:51.570
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

1621
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.270
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they'd get fucked up.</v>

1622
01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1623
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Because when I look at the martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists from 1993 that were competing in</v>

1624
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 3>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I look at the martial arts of today</v>

1625
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.150
<v Speaker 3>in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at John Jones.</v>

1626
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what the Fuck Jon Jones </v>
<v Speaker 3>would do to UFC one?</v>

1627
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how ridiculous it would be if </v>

1628
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you send John Jones in the UFC one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>

1629
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:11.190
<v Speaker 3>get that guy out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>

1630
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Like he's doing a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1631
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I think the martial artists of today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Demetrius Johnson,</v>

1632
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:18.240
<v Speaker 3>who I think is the best ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're still talking modern,</v>

1633
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:19.110
<v Speaker 3>modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern.</v>

1634
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Let's go 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put Jon Jones and the gladiator </v>

1635
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:28.311
<v Speaker 3>arena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you don't think he would fuck those </v>

1636
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:28.311
<v Speaker 3>guys up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be a hell of a gladiator.</v>

1637
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Fighters would have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they would.</v>

1638
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they would know what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>

1639
01:13:31.561 --> 01:13:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I think they knew what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

1640
01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1641
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know in 1993,</v>

1642
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this information had been lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1643
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:44.691
<v Speaker 3>But even Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which Jujitsu is a resurgence of old </v>

1644
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:45.570
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1645
01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying.</v>

1646
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like the dark ages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1647
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:53.930
<v Speaker 3>where they are in medieval times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't have the ability to </v>

1648
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:54.650
<v Speaker 3>share information like they have today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1649
01:13:54.651 --> 01:13:54.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1650
01:13:54.911 --> 01:13:57.270
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no internet or that's one of the</v>

1651
01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:59.310
<v Speaker 3>reasons why Jujitsu's at such a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level today.</v>

1652
01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Like there's all these like viral Bj </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

1653
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:06.171
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the ones I follow on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram is a bunch when I follow on </v>

1654
01:14:06.171 --> 01:14:08.991
<v Speaker 3>instagram where they'll have moves of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day and they show these moves and </v>

1655
01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:08.991
<v Speaker 3>you'd just.</v>

1656
01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing Jujitsu for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I watched something and I'll just go</v>

1657
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 3>like the home alone guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1658
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:19.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this work and move like every </v>

1659
01:14:19.141 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 3>day these kids are coming up with new </v>
<v Speaker 3>moves every day.</v>

1660
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I saw somebody figured out how to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

1661
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Some dude went from being in a heel hook</v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch in the guy in a Kamora and spun</v>

1662
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:32.950
<v Speaker 3>out of the heel hook into a Komora.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1663
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.150
<v Speaker 3>what did you just do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you watch you like how did it,</v>

1664
01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.240
<v Speaker 3>he just kind of replay it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>

1665
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1666
01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to what we were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about in ancient times.</v>

1667
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to fight was a life or </v>

1668
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:52.360
<v Speaker 2>death thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1669
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you were actually fighting to the death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1670
01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you,</v>

1671
01:14:57.821 --> 01:15:02.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually in the military is with a </v>

1672
01:15:02.821 --> 01:15:03.600
<v Speaker 2>shooting and guns and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see guys fighting.</v>

1673
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean it could be hand to hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part these guys were,</v>

1674
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.910
<v Speaker 2>were trained lawyers that would fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand to hand.</v>

1675
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.000
<v Speaker 2>That's why I say when you're fighting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death,</v>

1676
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.270
<v Speaker 2>you're damn good at what you do if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

1677
01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.080
<v Speaker 2>if you live but</v>

1678
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 3>don't live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to really learn anything.</v>

1679
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.080
<v Speaker 3>But there's plenty of guys that did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And so my point is that they were well </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained and they really knew what was </v>

1681
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:30.920
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1682
01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some good points on both</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

1683
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I think there were certainly some </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly tough people back then for </v>

1684
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1685
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure the pain threshold of his own </v>

1686
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.910
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's also this longing </v>

1687
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.910
<v Speaker 3>for nostalgia that a lot of people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to apply to,</v>

1688
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:48.110
<v Speaker 3>like the ancient martial artists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient fighters and they elect to look.</v>

1689
01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

1690
01:15:49.371 --> 01:15:50.990
<v Speaker 3>if they could fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know today,</v>

1691
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.870
<v Speaker 3>like if you could get this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Look Jack Dempsey,</v>

1692
01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:58.760
<v Speaker 3>who's a hell of a fighter and amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxer and just unbelievably tough man.</v>

1693
01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't last one round with Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson is prime,</v>

1694
01:16:02.511 --> 01:16:06.260
<v Speaker 3>would have ran through Jack Dempsey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have ran through all of them.</v>

1695
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:11.290
<v Speaker 3>He would have ran through gene tunney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have ran through all those </v>

1696
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:11.290
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

1697
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He rammed through everybody Iron Age </v>

1698
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1699
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.170
<v Speaker 2>But he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that because he was mike or is it </v>

1700
01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:18.360
<v Speaker 2>because those guys were really good.</v>

1701
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.930
<v Speaker 3>It was also because he had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern guys look pretty shitty.</v>

1702
01:16:21.931 --> 01:16:26.931
<v Speaker 3>He certainly did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had the benefit of having all of </v>

1703
01:16:26.931 --> 01:16:29.670
<v Speaker 3>those guys on film and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the internet when he had his,</v>

1704
01:16:29.671 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 3>his version of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was custom motto and cussed out.</v>

1705
01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not have got them on Reddit or </v>

1706
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>showed them all the funny memes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Instagram,</v>

1707
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.680
<v Speaker 3>but what he did do is he played him </v>
<v Speaker 3>these films,</v>

1708
01:16:40.681 --> 01:16:44.460
<v Speaker 3>these black and white films of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray Robinson of Jersey,</v>

1709
01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:49.461
<v Speaker 3>Joe Walcott of Rocky Marciano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got to watch these old school Jack </v>

1710
01:16:49.461 --> 01:16:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Dempsey tapes and he got to emulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>their techniques and understand and </v>

1711
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 3>custom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ana would go over and meticulously </v>

1712
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.761
<v Speaker 3>different positions and different ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>to encounter different styles and </v>

1713
01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:01.590
<v Speaker 3>different ways to move to get better </v>
<v Speaker 3>angles for counter shots,</v>

1714
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.800
<v Speaker 3>and he learned from all those techniques</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way those guys really didn't have </v>

1715
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.370
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to train,</v>

1716
01:17:08.371 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>they had to learn from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to watch other</v>

1717
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.980
<v Speaker 1>people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the benefit of </v>

1718
01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>having a library of films made a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong point.</v>

1719
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you happen to catch them in net man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

1720
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1721
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Three know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that mean?</v>

1722
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>You know the wing Chung guy was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those crazy kung fu movies.</v>

1723
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1724
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:29.050
<v Speaker 1>but Mike Tyson had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1725
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the scariest shit ever.</v>

1726
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Even to this day books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike gets still,</v>

1727
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he just trained for a six months or </v>

1728
01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:44.261
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he's still step in there </v>

1729
01:17:44.261 --> 01:17:44.261
<v Speaker 1>and take somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1730
01:17:44.261 --> 01:17:45.140
<v Speaker 1>he definitely looks like he's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat active.</v>

1731
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:48.600
<v Speaker 1>There was a video of him hitting the bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently for some shoot for something.</v>

1732
01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1733
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts,</v>

1734
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 1>it starts off slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts getting loosened up,</v>

1735
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 1>and then he starts teeing off in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baggy.</v>

1736
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>

1737
01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still fuck people up.</v>

1738
01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 1>He would still fuck people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1739
01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you would still fuck people up trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1740
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:01.760
<v Speaker 1>We're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still,</v>

1741
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I still haunted by that spinning back </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick you did in your garage that time.</v>

1742
01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.880
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking banana bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bennett.</v>

1743
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Half man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ribs hurt.</v>

1744
01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Just watching that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1745
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.330
<v Speaker 1>kicks are always going to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful than punches.</v>

1746
01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And I think that kicking technique is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the few things that is a little </v>

1747
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>bit behind in mma in comparison to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the traditional martial arts,</v>

1748
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:27.800
<v Speaker 1>especially like the spinning kicks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight kicks.</v>

1749
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Round kicks are pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty straightforward.</v>

1750
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.400
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the round kicks of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best Thai fighters in the round </v>

1751
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.310
<v Speaker 1>kicks of like the best Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Edson Barboza,</v>

1752
01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Barboza is right up there with pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much anybody and as far as far as like </v>

1753
01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.730
<v Speaker 1>kicking technique in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but spinning technique,</v>

1754
01:18:44.731 --> 01:18:46.680
<v Speaker 1>straight techniques like it's turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>side kicks.</v>

1755
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of lost knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those.</v>

1756
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Not so many guys know that man that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah used to have that awesome spinning</v>

1757
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:53.960
<v Speaker 1>back fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1758
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That caught by surprise.</v>

1759
01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.340
<v Speaker 1>And am I correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were the one that taught GSP that </v>

1760
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:01.640
<v Speaker 1>spinning back kick and he knew how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1761
01:19:01.641 --> 01:19:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but I helped refine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually came to me,</v>

1762
01:19:04.551 --> 01:19:09.551
<v Speaker 1>John Danaher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like one of the best Jujitsu </v>

<v Speaker 1>coaches in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's.</v>

1764
01:19:09.551 --> 01:19:11.810

<v Speaker 1>what they called a doner death squad.</v>

1765
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 1>He's all these guys that have Henzel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie is like Gary Tonin.</v>

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:05.590

<v Speaker 1>ridiculous being a comedian and you </v>

1785
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.750
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1788
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.960
<v Speaker 1>it sounds even to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous to me to say to John Danaher </v>

1789
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>was one of the best Jujitsu teachers in </v>

<v Speaker 1>Had had had been another time,</v>

1797
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably would have been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell of an MMA fighter yourself.</v>

1798
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people ask me that all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say,</v>

1799
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Joe Probably.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're a superior athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1801
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got the fast twitch muscle fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the power.</v>

1802
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I think a ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had you had a chance,</v>

1803
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.300
<v Speaker 1>let's say maybe 10 years prior to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it started,</v>

1804
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1805
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 1>that's very nice of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1806
01:20:57.230 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being nice.</v>

1807
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1808
01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 1>you're really athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong guy.</v>

1809
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly would have competed in mma </v>

1810
01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 1>like I did and kickboxing and taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I totally.</v>

1811
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:15.081
<v Speaker 1>Honestly though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been terrified of brain </v>

1812
01:21:15.081 --> 01:21:17.481
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew too many people when I was young </v>

1813
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that I knew were punchy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scares the shit out of me.</v>

1814
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's still to this day scares the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of me.</v>

1815
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1816
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:28.101
<v Speaker 1>If they're even thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even they even have one foot out the </v>

1817
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 1>back door through thinking about getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1818
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 1>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get out because it's going to be </v>

1819
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 1>some animal in there that's not thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about getting out.</v>

1820
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crates,</v>

1821
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:39.590
<v Speaker 1>young psychopath who's only thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about putting his shit to your face and </v>

1822
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>he's probably going to do it a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1823
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:43.400
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1824
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Philadelphia for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years and uh,</v>

1825
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 1>smoking Joe Fraser used to be down in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

1826
01:21:48.961 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the poor guy could barely put </v>
<v Speaker 1>two words together.</v>

1827
01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Hello to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't even know what he said.</v>

1828
01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 1>It was just really sad he was gone when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to a lot of those guys.</v>

1829
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it in my time in the UFC.</v>

1830
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1831
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it in my kickboxing days.</v>

1832
01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I saw it with guys when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.360
<v Speaker 1>when I went from taekwondo to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>

1834
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time in boxing gyms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1835
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:15.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch a lot of guys get beat up</v>

1836
01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of just a few years,</v>

1837
01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.450
<v Speaker 1>like three or four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see deterioration.</v>

1838
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's why Jujitsu and submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling is so much fun because you can</v>

1839
01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 1>pretty much go full tilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really spend yourself,</v>

1840
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.080
<v Speaker 1>get a nice workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one necessarily needs to get hurt if </v>

1841
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's highly uncomfortable.</v>

1842
01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:39.290
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1843
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1844
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1845
01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provided you godly,</v>

1846
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:48.041
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always have to have trust with your </v>

1847
01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:50.091
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is one thing you can do well </v>

1848
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:53.661
<v Speaker 1>into advanced stage and it is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti aging tool if you go at it in the </v>

1849
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:55.740
<v Speaker 1>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:22:55.741 --> 01:23:00.741
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up earlier when it comes to </v>

1851
01:23:00.741 --> 01:23:03.470
<v Speaker 1>joint manipulation or joint mobility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just flexibility and mobility,</v>

1852
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important</v>

1853
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 2>that people realize that if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body to be healthy,</v>

1854
01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:14.190
<v Speaker 2>you have to use it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have any excuses like old men </v>

1855
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:16.480
<v Speaker 2>have to actually have to work out more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than young guys.</v>

1856
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I got to work out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a couple of hours every day just to</v>

1857
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.010
<v Speaker 2>maintain seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing high intensity every day,</v>

1859
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high intensity twice a week.</v>

1860
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 2>So I don't burn out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1861
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:34.801
<v Speaker 2>even younger guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're involved with any </v>

1862
01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:36.901
<v Speaker 2>kind of sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be really careful that you </v>

1863
01:23:36.901 --> 01:23:39.451
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overtrain overtraining is a epidemic </v>

1864
01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:39.451
<v Speaker 2>amongst grapplers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu guys.</v>

1865
01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:44.431
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even mma guys are just chronically burn </v>

1866
01:23:44.431 --> 01:23:44.431
<v Speaker 2>it and burn it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1867
01:23:44.431 --> 01:23:48.720
<v Speaker 2>too hard workouts a week is enough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday you guys do plenty of mobility </v>

1868
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to do plenty of breathing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises,</v>

1869
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 2>walking cardio and I do some static </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching,</v>

1870
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's enabled me to still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1871
01:23:58.290 --> 01:23:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I can still hold my own in the mat.</v>

1872
01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:02.790
<v Speaker 2>And I surprised guy sometimes when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get on the mat and roll around,</v>

1873
01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first they start baby in May and then</v>

1874
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:06.540
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1875
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:11.610

<v Speaker 2>And then they start upping the ante a </v>

1876
01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:11.610
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1877
01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end,</v>

1878
01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually the one tap in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that probably shouldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>

2060
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:08.640
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2061
01:32:08.641 --> 01:32:11.950
<v Speaker 2>they had a specific educational style </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how to teach the move.</v>

2062
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And I was the first person to graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that instructor training program.</v>

2063
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:17.140
<v Speaker 2>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you,</v>

2064
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy of this Gracie University,</v>

2065
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 2>the thing that they're doing online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

2066
01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 2>The son's got a little carried away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blue about,</v>

2067
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2068
01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not real thrilled with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2069
01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.510
<v Speaker 2>there's one guy who's given a ride brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>belts online here.</v>

2070
01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean a Gracie?</v>

2071
01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2072
01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's pretty respected guy.</v>

2073
01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I read on the underground that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>given away up to brown belt online.</v>

2074
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:44.520
<v Speaker 2>How could you possibly respect that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2075
01:32:44.521 --> 01:32:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess the only way I would think </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically tested and proved himself.</v>

2076
01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:50.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was gonna say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2077
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I have seen guys that have trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much from the Internet.</v>

2078
01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I went to Tahiti,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hired by a group of grapplers to </v>

2079
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.130
<v Speaker 2>prepare them for the Society Society </v>
<v Speaker 2>Island Championship.</v>

2080
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It was very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grappling is a traditional sport in </v>

2081
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 2>amongst the Polynesian peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went to Tahiti.</v>

2082
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 2>I stayed there three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained these guys for the Society </v>

2083
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Island Championships and the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was running it was still a white belt </v>

2084
01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a prison guard there and Tahiti,</v>

2085
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 2>big guy and a unbelievable grappler.</v>

2086
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:28.480
<v Speaker 2>He outweighed me probably about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds yet he was very soft,</v>

2087
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:29.740
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical.</v>

2088
01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 2>He had never actually had a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He learned it all watching online on the</v>

2089
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of the bow then.</v>

2090
01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.640
<v Speaker 2>And I loved the way he trained with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very respectful even though as </v>

2091
01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 years older than him and much </v>

2092
01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:43.880
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We x a good training.</v>

2093
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I just gave the guy that blew about </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the spot.</v>

2094
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2095
01:33:47.921 --> 01:33:52.921
<v Speaker 2>there was no way that that guy was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white belt and I've done that at </v>

2096
01:33:52.921 --> 01:33:56.011
<v Speaker 2>different places where people don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good instructor where they are under </v>

2097
01:33:56.011 --> 01:33:57.400
<v Speaker 2>promoted and I'll get on the mat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2098
01:33:57.401 --> 01:34:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I see what they can do and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2099
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is under promoted.</v>

2100
01:34:02.001 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 2>He just hasn't had a chance to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate guy give him a promotion.</v>

2101
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I have got rolling with a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>students and he was the teacher </v>

2102
01:34:11.441 --> 01:34:12.750
<v Speaker 2>basically because people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teacher.</v>

2103
01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out teacher and his guys were good.</v>

2104
01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 2>They were really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

2105
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just really pay attention to the </v>

2106
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:24.451
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals and you really understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the principles behind each individual </v>

2107
01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:28.231
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn a lot online to learn a </v>

2108
01:34:28.231 --> 01:34:28.231
<v Speaker 2>lot online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not brown belt.</v>

2109
01:34:28.231 --> 01:34:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Now I just feel like I need someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>there right there with you below about </v>

2110
01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:35.540
<v Speaker 2>almost anyone can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2111
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2112
01:34:36.461 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I heard a really funny analogy one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>

2113
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I think one of carly gracie's barbells </v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it was health got bit.</v>

2114
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.470
<v Speaker 2>He said basically a white belt as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sperm.</v>

2115
01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:51.150
<v Speaker 2>The seed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time your four degree a wipe out </v>

2116
01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:55.621
<v Speaker 2>your like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little baby that was just born </v>

2117
01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:55.621
<v Speaker 2>and then the blue about is like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>toddler,</v>

2118
01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 2>like just a little little kid doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know what he doesn't know yet,</v>

2119
01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 2>but the time you're like a four degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>blue about your,</v>

2120
01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you're like a child.</v>

2121
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And then the purple bow is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teenager,</v>

2122
01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.640
<v Speaker 2>dangerous teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

2123
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.960
<v Speaker 2>you got the technique but you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to know that they can do it to </v>

2124
01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 2>purple belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like some of the most </v>

2125
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:20.201
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous guy because a lot of </v>

2126
01:35:20.201 --> 01:35:20.800
<v Speaker 2>times he's still using a lot of power </v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got the technique to.</v>

2127
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And then of course by the time you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brand brand,</v>

2128
01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you're like a young man and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a brown belt is a black powder</v>

2129
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.720
<v Speaker 2>and the skies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just once you make Brown bought,</v>

2130
01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make black belt unless he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does outright quit.</v>

2131
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2132
01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a black box like you know,</v>

2133
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 2>a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

2134
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I got the black bow,</v>

2135
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a whole new layer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning was taking place at that point.</v>

2136
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd never stopped learning and Jujitsu</v>

2137
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:53.951
<v Speaker 2>as long as your bodies to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're talking about these new </v>

2138
01:35:53.951 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 2>moves that are constantly coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you know,</v>

2139
01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:58.040
<v Speaker 2>John John Machado has this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting take on things.</v>

2140
01:35:58.041 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you know,</v>

2141
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 2>the less you use Lsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2142
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:06.431
<v Speaker 2>I might know 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques but to win match I might use </v>

2143
01:36:06.431 --> 01:36:06.800
<v Speaker 2>to solve the said that one time he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2144
01:36:06.801 --> 01:36:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I know 30 ways to pass the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only use two.</v>

2145
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I have a backup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move a and then backup plan.</v>

2146
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Big Case it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's just the way it is.</v>

2147
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Man was really good guy follow game that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that song's pressure.</v>

2148
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Solid top gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His bodyweight.</v>

2149
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when I used to train to Sala he</v>

2150
01:36:25.491 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 2>could tap me out on the cross side </v>
<v Speaker 2>without even putting a submission hold,</v>

2151
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:31.430
<v Speaker 2>just crushing me with his weight.</v>

2152
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2153
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:34.160
<v Speaker 2>he's heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not that heavy.</v>

2154
01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.480
<v Speaker 2>He would rob your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just the most horrible feeling.</v>

2155
01:36:38.481 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like being waterboarded or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2156
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2157
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure he learned to do that,</v>

2158
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2159
01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2160
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2161
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:55.660
<v Speaker 2>as far as moves and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of the most outstanding </v>

2162
01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:00.070
<v Speaker 2>clinics have ever witnessed was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>John Shock Machado was in the second </v>

2163
01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:05.140
<v Speaker 2>abut Dhabi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually went over to the Arab </v>

2164
01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Emirates and I wanted to support Salo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whoever at that time.</v>

2165
01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't believe the clinic he put</v>
<v Speaker 2>on all closed guard too.</v>

2166
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.070
<v Speaker 2>That's another lost art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see too many guys use it,</v>

2167
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cron uses.</v>

2168
01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.140
<v Speaker 2>It could close guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But John Jock put on a clinic.</v>

2169
01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this super fight with Mario </v>

2170
01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Sperry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw such a.</v>

2171
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:25.100
<v Speaker 2>He almost put sperry out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>never saw anything about it.</v>

2187
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.420

<v Speaker 1>it sounds derogatory.</v>

2195
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Almost like someone like Minotauro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

<v Speaker 2>vibe you attract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're like a real negative person</v>

2288
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.790
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2289
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:59.820
<v Speaker 2>think saying negative statements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in a lot of negative emotional </v>

2290
01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:03.600
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to have a pretty </v>

2291
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:03.600
<v Speaker 2>shitty life.</v>

2292
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:03.600
<v Speaker 2>And if you're thinking like a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2293
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 2>ha her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2294
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:09.961
<v Speaker 2>the highest would be love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be the highest vibration </v>

2295
01:42:09.961 --> 01:42:09.961
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good things happen to you.</v>

2296
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2297
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:13.210
<v Speaker 2>in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much more complicated than that.</v>

2298
01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>So like the secret essentially like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>grit,</v>

2299
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is a great little book.</v>

2300
01:42:18.201 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Developed his,</v>

2301
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his astrological,</v>

2302
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2303
01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.810
<v Speaker 2>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2304
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:29.110
<v Speaker 2>on mental science as well as a basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

2305
01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:31.090
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he read my life,</v>

2306
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 2>he looked at all the places in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

2307
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put off a vibration like,</v>

2308
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:40.810
<v Speaker 2>like an energy vibration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can actually be measured,</v>

2309
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:42.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

2310
01:42:42.361 --> 01:42:44.940
<v Speaker 2>yours would be as identifiable as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingerprints or you know,</v>

2311
01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.470
<v Speaker 2>like an eye reading iridology or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2312
01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's places on the earth that put off</v>

2313
01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:54.070
<v Speaker 2>a vibration also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the place that vibes best with me is</v>

2314
01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:56.500
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the South Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in particular,</v>

2315
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Maui.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he really,</v>

2316
01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:03.990
<v Speaker 2>he really honed it down to the town of </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] to try to sell you a house </v>

2317
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 2>there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2318
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:08.550
<v Speaker 2>the spot 67 clover lane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.460
<v Speaker 2>there we go man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go online and look at that.</v>

2320
01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house is for sale ads.</v>

2321
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Damn Robert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're amazing.</v>

2322
01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:15.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2323
01:43:15.531 --> 01:43:16.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

2324
01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 2>now he is supposedly the best vibration </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2325
01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.200
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

2326
01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:20.650
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

2327
01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 3>So I explained to me how this guy goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2328
01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:26.280
<v Speaker 3>So he finds out what your address or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what your,</v>

2329
01:43:26.281 --> 01:43:28.140
<v Speaker 3>your date of birth is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2330
01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.870
<v Speaker 3>part of the world you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what time?</v>

2331
01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And then once he has some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer program with all his charts and</v>

2332
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:39.520
<v Speaker 2>numbers and he plugs all this stuff in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I asked them like,</v>

2333
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:40.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2334
01:43:40.151 --> 01:43:44.620
<v Speaker 2>You're actually looking at the computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it says it's just basically he says,</v>

2335
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't make exact predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said if I could make exact predictions.</v>

2336
01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I played the stock market and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2337
01:43:51.801 --> 01:43:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2338
01:43:52.531 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I can come up with high probability for </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things happening.</v>

2339
01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.950
<v Speaker 2>And also he's looking at you ever hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective consciousness,</v>

2340
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your higher consciousness,</v>

2341
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 2>you have your subconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a collective mindset.</v>

2342
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone's emotions and moods </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thoughts,</v>

2343
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2344
01:44:11.691 --> 01:44:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Now it's one of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2345
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:15.560
<v Speaker 2>everyone's so afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2346
01:44:15.561 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm traveling all over the world so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can literally feel the fear right now,</v>

2347
01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Europe is all up in arms because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attacks and things.</v>

2348
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:24.380
<v Speaker 2>And people are really scared with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis and all this.</v>

2349
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:29.620
<v Speaker 2>There's like a real fear mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if you give into that </v>

2350
01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:32.951
<v Speaker 2>fear mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually create the very thing </v>

2351
01:44:32.951 --> 01:44:32.951
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically concentrated on them.</v>

2352
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like a form of visualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2353
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.240
<v Speaker 2>If you're always like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the shark thing we were </v>

2354
01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.791
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would create a situation </v>

2355
01:44:42.791 --> 01:44:44.750
<v Speaker 2>where I'd meet a shark if I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming in the ocean because you know,</v>

2356
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I put too much energy into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:44:46.521 --> 01:44:48.200
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I was the snorkel,</v>

2358
01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the goggles underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2359
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:50.060
<v Speaker 2>where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2360
01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The soccer for you and I,</v>

2361
01:44:52.191 --> 01:44:57.191
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would probably possibly actually </v>

2362
01:44:57.191 --> 01:44:57.730
<v Speaker 2>attract a negative situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sad.</v>

2363
01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:00.230
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a collective mindset.</v>

2364
01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:03.320
<v Speaker 2>You can even feel like different </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries have different moods.</v>

2365
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:08.500
<v Speaker 2>When I get off the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can actually feel that I'm pretty </v>

2366
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:08.500
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to this.</v>

2367
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Like in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real somber,</v>

2368
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:11.390
<v Speaker 2>kind of almost depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2369
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 2>a place like Maui.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2370
01:45:13.130 --> 01:45:18.130
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel so happy because I was so </v>

2371
01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:18.130
<v Speaker 2>lucky there in paradise there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise,</v>

2372
01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mood is much higher.</v>

2373
01:45:19.551 --> 01:45:24.551
<v Speaker 2>The aloha spirit as they say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he told me that was the single best </v>

2374
01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.570
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other places were a place in Alaska,</v>

2375
01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:31.070
<v Speaker 2>was a place near a little town I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even recall.</v>

2376
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And then another place was little part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Alaskan coast on the coast.</v>

2377
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 2>The coast is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Like near Anchorage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2379
01:45:37.521 --> 01:45:39.140
<v Speaker 2>it was near Anchorage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use a little town.</v>

2380
01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:44.141
<v Speaker 2>Just be amazed at how moderate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate is to everyone says it's quite </v>

2381
01:45:44.141 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 2>nice there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know.</v>

2382
01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Alaska,</v>

2383
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maui,</v>

2384
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2385
01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it wasn't a hard choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2386
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:58.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a very relaxed environment in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>only to like the places relaxed.</v>

2387
01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a relaxed place to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2388
01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 2>as far as like the people that live </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2389
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:04.850
<v Speaker 2>they're really cool and chilled out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally children.</v>

2390
01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.890
<v Speaker 2>My webmaster lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Crook,</v>

2391
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.050
<v Speaker 2>awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2392
01:46:09.051 --> 01:46:10.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have business to do with him.</v>

2393
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing a great job for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2394
01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:17.850
<v Speaker 2>what does the guy told you you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live near like oil minds and South </v>

2395
01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Dakota be less reluctant or more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be oil minds near South </v>

2396
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2397
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Like someone that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can live right outside of like some </v>

2398
01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:30.890
<v Speaker 2>fracking fucking compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:35.891
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think someone with a really negative </v>

2400
01:46:35.891 --> 01:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>mindset might have attracted a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2401
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:41.890
<v Speaker 2>So then I tried to keep the vibe heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean a light and at a higher </v>

2402
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.610
<v Speaker 2>higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2403
01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:49.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can attract goodness and abundance </v>

2404
01:46:49.690 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like</v>

2405
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.910
<v Speaker 1>the sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2406
01:46:50.911 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a good book for people to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2407
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson was,</v>

2408
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:59.780
<v Speaker 1>was quite an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You the power of positive thinking for </v>

2409
01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:03.081
<v Speaker 1>sure is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for sure there's a lot of good </v>

2410
01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:03.960
<v Speaker 1>that can be done in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at things,</v>

2411
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:06.150
<v Speaker 1>if you have a positive approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

2412
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you could look at things in a good way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have those things have positive </v>

2413
01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have have benefit in those things.</v>

2414
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Or you could look at the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing exact same moment your life and </v>

2415
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 1>just decide that this is the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is terrible.</v>

2416
01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:25.461
<v Speaker 1>You're a loser and people have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply grooved patterns that they've </v>

2417
01:47:25.461 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 1>carved out in their consciousness over </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years of approaching different</v>

2418
01:47:29.371 --> 01:47:34.371
<v Speaker 1>situations with very similar reactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost like automatically like </v>

2419
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:37.530
<v Speaker 1>something happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything always goes wrong for me.</v>

2420
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life sucks.</v>

2421
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you compared your life to someone</v>

2422
01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:46.221
<v Speaker 1>who's born in Bangladesh or Ethiopia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some someplace where people are like </v>

2423
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 1>really genuinely unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be laughing at you.</v>

2424
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:52.740
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in America and you're white and</v>

2425
01:47:52.741 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you don't have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just shut the fuck up.</v>

2426
01:47:55.321 --> 01:48:00.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's perfect example of that </v>

2427
01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:00.321
<v Speaker 1>would be a George Costanza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this character right on,</v>

2428
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:01.250
<v Speaker 1>on Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2429
01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:03.930
<v Speaker 1>The guy that no matter how good he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2430
01:48:03.931 --> 01:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>he always had managed to screw it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow and things would always,</v>

2431
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:10.830
<v Speaker 1>always turned back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all had the experience of being in</v>

2432
01:48:10.831 --> 01:48:13.230
<v Speaker 1>a room and someone would come into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

2433
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of a dark vibe and the whole room </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibe with shore,</v>

2434
01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:22.380
<v Speaker 1>but then we've also had the experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a guy would come in who was a real</v>

2435
01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.440
<v Speaker 1>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive thinking person and everyone's </v>

2436
01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.130
<v Speaker 1>mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just let that collective conscious </v>

2437
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:33.581
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be so aware of because not</v>
<v Speaker 1>every thought that a person has is that </v>

2438
01:48:33.581 --> 01:48:33.581
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2439
01:48:33.581 --> 01:48:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can come from the outside.</v>

2440
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:39.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't manufacture our own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be influenced by negative </v>

2441
01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:42.831
<v Speaker 1>thinking from other people or positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking from other people and you got </v>

2442
01:48:42.831 --> 01:48:46.451
<v Speaker 1>to start to be very conscious of they </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thoughts passing through your </v>

2443
01:48:46.451 --> 01:48:49.050
<v Speaker 1>brain and reject those negative thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy.</v>

2444
01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a discipline like working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is and it's also one of the </v>

2445
01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:56.250
<v Speaker 1>more important aspects about surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself with positive people.</v>

2446
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:58.020
<v Speaker 1>When you surround yourself with positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2447
01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you find them to be inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get excited.</v>

2448
01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:05.481
<v Speaker 1>You all think along similar lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You support each other and help each </v>

2449
01:49:05.481 --> 01:49:06.240
<v Speaker 1>other and it benefits everybody and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

2450
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:10.020
<v Speaker 1>You develop like a real keen sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like love and community,</v>

2451
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.360
<v Speaker 1>whereas if you're around people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly negative,</v>

2452
01:49:12.361 --> 01:49:14.510
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in conflict all the time,</v>

2453
01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.180
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2454
01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly getting exhausted too </v>

2455
01:49:20.230 --> 01:49:20.540
<v Speaker 1>by the stress of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory in that too,</v>

2456
01:49:20.541 --> 01:49:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's just my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2457
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:23.910
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the mental science we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2458
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that those people are the ones</v>

2459
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:30.490
<v Speaker 1>that attract all sorts of degenerative </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and,</v>

2460
01:49:30.491 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2461
01:49:31.150 --> 01:49:32.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2462
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:34.330
<v Speaker 1>bad things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2463
01:49:34.331 --> 01:49:37.020
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can play a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially stress,</v>

2464
01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:42.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress has been shown to be devastating </v>

2465
01:49:42.021 --> 01:49:44.061
<v Speaker 1>to your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that have really stressful lives </v>

2466
01:49:44.061 --> 01:49:47.271
<v Speaker 1>and don't get enough sleep and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly negative and thinks about </v>

2467
01:49:47.271 --> 01:49:47.271
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep is more important than diet.</v>

2468
01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

2469
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.260
<v Speaker 2>that are overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

2470
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you could be in the best diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world and still having a lot of </v>

2471
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.620
<v Speaker 2>struggle with weight if you're missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sleep.</v>

2472
01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

2473
01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:03.570
<v Speaker 2>even with my own clients because I do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of fat loss programs and you guys </v>

2474
01:50:03.570 --> 01:50:06.850
<v Speaker 2>will be eating pretty decent and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing the weight and then,</v>

2475
01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking,</v>

2476
01:50:07.481 --> 01:50:08.620
<v Speaker 2>they're only getting like five and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

2477
01:50:08.621 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 2>six hours a night and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stressed.</v>

2478
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:16.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a tendency really hold onto </v>

2479
01:50:16.050 --> 01:50:16.050
<v Speaker 2>water and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2480
01:50:16.050 --> 01:50:16.940
<v Speaker 2>your body will hold onto that body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an oil.</v>

2481
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:21.950
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to dilute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The of that is an interesting aspect of </v>

2482
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>a lack of sleep is that your body holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto fat.</v>

2483
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It really holds on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also fluids,</v>

2484
01:50:25.571 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call false fat.</v>

2485
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not even fat is just like all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluid.</v>

2486
01:50:30.931 --> 01:50:35.931
<v Speaker 2>It just gets trapped in the tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might as well be fat because it's </v>

2487
01:50:35.931 --> 01:50:37.360
<v Speaker 2>just as unattractive and just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable,</v>

2488
01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you</v>

2489
01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:44.510
<v Speaker 3>bother investigating what this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing about this astrology stuff?</v>

2490
01:50:44.511 --> 01:50:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Did you bother looking into it?</v>

2491
01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2492
01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.740
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his website is quite interesting.</v>

2493
01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Is radiant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last is like fantastic.</v>

2494
01:50:52.711 --> 01:50:53.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>

2495
01:50:53.491 --> 01:50:58.491
<v Speaker 2>What is the astrology itself based on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on the position of the stars </v>

2496
01:50:58.491 --> 01:50:58.620
<v Speaker 2>time you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Haley is Haley heliocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old astrology with earl was earth </v>

2498
01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:05.100
<v Speaker 2>based because they believed the earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the center of the universe.</v>

2499
01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:07.710
<v Speaker 2>He created his own Heleo is Hetrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2500
01:51:07.730 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 2>with the sun is the center and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just basically created his own </v>

2501
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:13.350
<v Speaker 2>astrology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

2502
01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:19.580
<v Speaker 3>How does one do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does one create their own astrology </v>

2503
01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:19.580
<v Speaker 3>and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>

2504
01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I got almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say almost almost understand</v>

2505
01:51:23.671 --> 01:51:28.671
<v Speaker 3>how someone could imagine that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at thousands of years of data,</v>

2506
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you could figure out that people develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain personality traits if they were </v>

2507
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:39.111
<v Speaker 3>born during certain times and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of try to align those times with </v>

2508
01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.520
<v Speaker 3>the constellations in the sky that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving and the,</v>

2509
01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way the earth wobbles and where</v>

2510
01:51:45.961 --> 01:51:49.950
<v Speaker 3>the stars are at any given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of almost makes sense.</v>

2511
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 3>But this guy doing it on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2512
01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.480
<v Speaker 3>how's he doing that?</v>

2513
01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even pretend to really </v>

2514
01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's know what sold me.</v>

2515
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have said Maui.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's at valley.</v>

2516
01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.110
<v Speaker 2>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2517
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to understand it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2518
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:07.870
<v Speaker 2>he basically read mine life to me like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

2519
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It says there's no freaking way that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have known this information.</v>

2520
01:52:12.611 --> 01:52:14.170
<v Speaker 2>What kind of stuff that could he not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have known.</v>

2521
01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Just the way my life went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2522
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:19.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my relationship with my parents and</v>

2523
01:52:19.211 --> 01:52:22.390
<v Speaker 2>the relationship with my ex wife and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way my marriage went,</v>

2524
01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:26.110
<v Speaker 2>a way my marriage dissolved and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2525
01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:29.980
<v Speaker 2>just all sorts of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of like a Tarot card reader.</v>

2526
01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Tarot card reader is bullshit.</v>

2527
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2528
01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:39.530
<v Speaker 2>And this is not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

2529
01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:44.730
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's told me not to do stuff and I've </v>

2530
01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>done it and</v>

2531
01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.990
<v Speaker 1>never has worked out for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2532
01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but isn't impossible that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why it didn't work out because </v>

2533
01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:56.531
<v Speaker 1>he told you not do it and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it and your negative </v>

2534
01:52:56.531 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 1>thinking and negative thinking.</v>

2535
01:52:57.150 --> 01:52:59.330
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the brand.</v>

2536
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.070
<v Speaker 2>All I know is every time I go against </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2537
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>it just usually doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I listened to the guy,</v>

2538
01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:07.100
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost always works out</v>

2539
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is sort of contrary.</v>

2540
01:53:09.451 --> 01:53:14.451
<v Speaker 1>This goes along with what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're almost not giving yourself </v>

2541
01:53:14.451 --> 01:53:15.210
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not following your own advice.</v>

2542
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally were just talking about </v>

2543
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 1>thinking about things in a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2544
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 1>like things are predestined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy has sort of created these </v>

2545
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>scenarios that you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't engage in</v>

2546
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:28.770
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's told me something on my chart,</v>

2547
01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll call them a day or two </v>

2548
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.890
<v Speaker 2>later and just completely changed your </v>
<v Speaker 2>charts changed.</v>

2549
01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2550
01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.480
<v Speaker 2>something changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I says,</v>

2551
01:53:36.481 --> 01:53:37.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

2552
01:53:37.290 --> 01:53:39.360
<v Speaker 2>two days ago you said I shouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2553
01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Now you're saying it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He claims it's like quantum physics,</v>

2554
01:53:43.831 --> 01:53:48.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you change your thought or your </v>

2555
01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:50.940
<v Speaker 2>vibration level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually sees a change on his chart,</v>

2556
01:53:50.941 --> 01:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>on his computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2557
01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2558
01:53:54.511 --> 01:53:57.270
<v Speaker 2>This makes zero sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2559
01:53:57.271 --> 01:53:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you another example of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this might work.</v>

2560
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy that was a,</v>

2561
01:54:02.251 --> 01:54:02.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2562
01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>by a professor of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2563
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:05.130
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2564
01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:10.150
<v Speaker 2>actually a phd in biochemistry and Board</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certified Nutritionist Name is Dr </v>

2565
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Gregory House and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to take hair samples,</v>

2566
01:54:12.930 --> 01:54:17.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would test these things out for </v>

2567
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.930
<v Speaker 2>like various deficiencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2568
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.930
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing.</v>

2569
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

2570
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was into this,</v>

2571
01:54:21.091 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2572
01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.560
<v Speaker 2>electric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2573
01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:29.090
<v Speaker 2>basically I am attached that hair </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever and as my body would change,</v>

2574
01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:34.500
<v Speaker 2>the hair sample would change even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was no longer connected to it.</v>

2575
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Change how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would no longer show the deficiency </v>

2576
01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:40.180
<v Speaker 2>when he would retest it.</v>

2577
01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2578
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2579
01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit.</v>

2580
01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Not Violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a hardcore scientist man.</v>

2581
01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>PHB just set up tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't make any sense.</v>

2582
01:54:50.911 --> 01:54:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

2583
01:54:52.290 --> 01:54:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

2584
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your physical hair is not going to </v>

2585
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changed what actually changed?</v>

2586
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2587
01:54:59.491 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2588
01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I had trouble believing in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see it?</v>

2589
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fact,</v>

2590
01:55:03.781 --> 01:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>if you read into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at data,</v>

2591
01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I tested really actually understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

2592
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:13.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I knew him not to be a liar.</v>

2593
01:55:13.261 --> 01:55:14.370
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was sure he's not,</v>

2594
01:55:14.371 --> 01:55:17.010
<v Speaker 1>but he might just be delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So looking at something like that,</v>

2595
01:55:17.011 --> 01:55:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defies physics.</v>

2596
01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It defies science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physics that completely through physics </v>

2597
01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:24.560
<v Speaker 1>on its ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2598
01:55:24.561 --> 01:55:28.020
<v Speaker 1>But we know that electronic can occupy </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one space,</v>

2599
01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:32.670
<v Speaker 1>which now opens up the whole door for </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel universes,</v>

2600
01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:38.100
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Hawkings just recently claimed </v>

2601
01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:42.060
<v Speaker 2>that the black holes are like a door </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one universe to another.</v>

2602
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 2>So there's all this crazy</v>

2603
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.110
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just put everything on end.</v>

2604
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:50.910
<v Speaker 1>What we know about physics and medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>

2605
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's one called vibrational</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine that they actually talk about </v>

2606
01:55:56.210 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check out that book,</v>

2607
01:55:56.611 --> 01:55:57.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

2608
01:55:57.181 --> 01:56:02.181
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing subatomic particles when we're </v>

2609
01:56:02.181 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 1>testing hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you touch someone's hair and you're</v>

2610
01:56:03.691 --> 01:56:06.480
<v Speaker 1>testing here for various mineral </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies in vitamins,</v>

2611
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>those things aren't flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air and going back and forth.</v>

2612
01:56:09.810 --> 01:56:11.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was actually,</v>

2613
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:13.880
<v Speaker 1>he was actually testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2614
01:56:13.930 --> 01:56:17.190
<v Speaker 1>the vibrational level of the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2615
01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything puts off like a,</v>

2616
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.980
<v Speaker 1>like an aura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can photograph it with Kirlian </v>

2617
01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:25.620
<v Speaker 1>photography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually photograph the energy.</v>

2618
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You know everything has an aura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even this cup,</v>

2619
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 1>this table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and aura that you can actually</v>

2620
01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:35.601
<v Speaker 1>prove a real aura or the someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes they've actually taken pictures</v>

2621
01:56:35.701 --> 01:56:35.940
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

2622
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:39.120
<v Speaker 1>You've heard the Kirlian photography </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to spell that.</v>

2623
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.890
<v Speaker 1>A fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell that?</v>

2624
01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Kirlian photography and they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have taken pictures of this and he can </v>

2625
01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 1>actually measure the energy coming off </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and it matched me.</v>

2626
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:57.770
<v Speaker 1>But Jamie's a photographer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's should know about Kirlian </v>

2627
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.770
<v Speaker 1>photography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever hear about that Shit Jamie?</v>

2628
01:56:57.770 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I've ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried to bang some chick </v>

2629
01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 1>was really into crystals of it's to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you about it.</v>

2630
01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2631
01:57:04.411 --> 01:57:08.100
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple and it works for me,</v>

2632
01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:13.101
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I understand that it probably has </v>

2633
01:57:13.101 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>its application in the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of the mind.</v>

2634
01:57:13.681 --> 01:57:16.080
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it a big giant placebo effect?</v>

2635
01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know this.</v>

2636
01:57:17.941 --> 01:57:20.550
<v Speaker 1>In a recent study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found that placebo drugs work about</v>

2637
01:57:20.551 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 1>40 percent better than real drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What test is this?</v>

2638
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

2639
01:57:25.501 --> 01:57:28.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing that I did mushrooms.</v>

2640
01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I read a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2641
01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:32.760
<v Speaker 1>they've given people like regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication,</v>

2642
01:57:32.761 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from pharmaceutical stuff.</v>

2643
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:39.380
<v Speaker 1>They found that placebos work way better</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what application though.</v>

2644
01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say that it,</v>

2645
01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:47.360
<v Speaker 1>the placebos worked way better for </v>
<v Speaker 1>relief and pain relief makes sense </v>

2646
01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.200
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of pain relief you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do with your own mind.</v>

2647
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't take pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got knee surgery and I didn't take a </v>

2648
01:57:57.410 --> 01:58:02.241
<v Speaker 1>damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read so many negative side </v>

2649
01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:04.560
<v Speaker 1>effects of the Ibuprofen and the this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

2650
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:09.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen would say probably the safest </v>

2651
01:58:09.561 --> 01:58:09.561
<v Speaker 1>evolve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's still not good for you.</v>

2652
01:58:09.561 --> 01:58:13.160
<v Speaker 1>But my fear was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew too many people that got </v>

2653
01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:13.160
<v Speaker 1>addicted to pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2654
01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:13.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

2655
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:15.240
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst part about pain?</v>

2656
01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2657
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:22.940
<v Speaker 1>isn't that just okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just deal with not feeling good </v>

2658
01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:25.821
<v Speaker 1>while you heal like the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know I'm in pain because I'm </v>

2659
01:58:25.821 --> 01:58:27.630
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An awful lot of pain is cut,</v>

2660
01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mind thing like how you approach the </v>

2661
01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.570
<v Speaker 1>signal that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that back pain guy,</v>

2662
01:58:33.850 --> 01:58:37.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the steward,</v>

2663
01:58:37.801 --> 01:58:42.801
<v Speaker 1>Miguel de,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were looking at x rays that </v>

2664
01:58:42.801 --> 01:58:44.691
<v Speaker 1>people's backs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with chronic back pain a lot of </v>

2665
01:58:44.691 --> 01:58:46.570
<v Speaker 1>times it would not have any physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to be in back,</v>

2666
01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2667
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And then they were all at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2668
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:54.520
<v Speaker 1>pictures of guys that were active like </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and their backs are a mess.</v>

2669
01:58:54.521 --> 01:58:59.521
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of slipped disc and the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not in any pain at all and it must </v>

2670
01:58:59.521 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 1>be afraid of we'll get an x ray on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

2671
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:00.180
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2672
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2673
01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2674
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 1>If anybody would have a messed up back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got to be me all the falls and throws</v>

2675
01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:12.751
<v Speaker 1>up taking over 45 years of wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>users using little tiny micro injury </v>

2676
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:15.160
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yet I'm not in any pain at all.</v>

2677
01:59:15.370 --> 01:59:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2678
01:59:16.121 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>pain is an interesting thing in that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the mind can regulate pain,</v>

2679
01:59:20.561 --> 01:59:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I meant by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals,</v>

2680
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:27.170
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make sense with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications where we,</v>

2681
01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:32.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find like anti epileptic medications </v>

2682
01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.951
<v Speaker 1>or things along those lines where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just know for a fact as a physical </v>

2683
01:59:34.951 --> 01:59:38.851
<v Speaker 1>effect on the body that these drugs have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they don't understand placebo </v>

2684
01:59:38.851 --> 01:59:39.710
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2685
01:59:39.711 --> 01:59:44.711
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that placebo effect is real </v>

2686
01:59:44.711 --> 01:59:45.970
<v Speaker 1>and it does work in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances is the power of the mind.</v>

2687
01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it especially dependent upon who is </v>

2688
01:59:51.190 --> 01:59:52.560
<v Speaker 1>receiving that effect and you know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the person believes in this thing's</v>

2689
01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 1>gonna heal them.</v>

2690
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And if people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2691
01:59:55.900 --> 02:00:00.900
<v Speaker 1>what I find is a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really into the body but they're not </v>

2692
02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>really working with their mind or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts are or anything like that.</v>

2693
02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of discipline.</v>

2694
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

2695
02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you really have to clearly establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's woo,</v>

2696
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>what's nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy crystal bullshit and what is an </v>

2697
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>applicable modality like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2698
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>what can you really do as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation as far as things that are </v>

2699
02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:25.931
<v Speaker 1>repeatable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people have shown to have a </v>

2700
02:00:25.931 --> 02:00:29.101
<v Speaker 1>beneficial effect on your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beneficial effect on the way you </v>

2701
02:00:29.101 --> 02:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>approach life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2702
02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>and that is pretty much individually it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2703
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to,</v>

2704
02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you self experimentation one I just </v>

2705
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>talked about might sound pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird to a lot of people,</v>

2706
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but so far it's been working for me well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as I feel good about it.</v>

2707
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't feel like it diminishes my </v>

2708
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>life in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's taken advantage of me,</v>

2709
02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2710
02:00:53.681 --> 02:00:58.681
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like confident and really good </v>

2711
02:00:58.681 --> 02:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>about those type of information I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting and I found it worked.</v>

2712
02:01:02.021 --> 02:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>But like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the mind.</v>

2713
02:01:04.361 --> 02:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2714
02:01:04.941 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>if you just approach it on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

2715
02:01:06.791 --> 02:01:11.791
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's going to give me advice and </v>

2716
02:01:11.791 --> 02:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find this advice to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial and I'm going to follow </v>

2717
02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.291
<v Speaker 1>through with it and I'm gonna use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a guideline and I'm going to have </v>

2718
02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>good confidence in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These choices are going to be correct </v>

2719
02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.901
<v Speaker 1>because of this guy and his knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my problem is I've just,</v>

2720
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too much bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2721
02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever beliefs I might've had like </v>

2722
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>even six years ago before I started this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2723
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them have eroded just under </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny.</v>

2724
02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Just understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2725
02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I hear Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always advise people,</v>

2726
02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>give the guy a call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first session is free.</v>

2727
02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>If you think he's a crackpot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never call them again.</v>

2728
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

2729
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>what I would want to do my problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that as I want,</v>

2730
02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I would want to go down the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to find out,</v>

2731
02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you making these distinctions?</v>

2732
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2733
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>how did you devise this method?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on behind the scenes?</v>

2734
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:55.010
<v Speaker 1>What do you base this on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

2735
02:01:55.011 --> 02:02:00.011
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you saying when you tell </v>

2736
02:02:00.011 --> 02:02:00.011
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2737
02:02:00.011 --> 02:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>don't take that flight to Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>because something bad's going to happen.</v>

2738
02:02:00.651 --> 02:02:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that you don't know </v>

2739
02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:08.621
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reality is you tell </v>

2740
02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:08.621
<v Speaker 1>someone don't do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tell someone,</v>

2741
02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:13.121
<v Speaker 1>hey steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think you should go to </v>

2742
02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

2743
02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says I shouldn't go to Florida.</v>

2744
02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>You're already starting at cascade of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative thoughts and that,</v>

2745
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:19.460
<v Speaker 1>to me that is a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had thought about that.</v>

2746
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's not a fucking person in the</v>

2747
02:02:21.351 --> 02:02:26.351
<v Speaker 1>world that can tell you that if you pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your car keys and drive your car to </v>

2748
02:02:26.351 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's gonna go wrong.</v>

2749
02:02:27.650 --> 02:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>So if this guy's telling you that I call</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

2750
02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>not only do I call bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that kind of stuff was </v>

2751
02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of dangerous because what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it is like,</v>

2752
02:02:37.930 --> 02:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were really influenced by the </v>

2753
02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>collective a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2754
02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>like people's general moods and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gives me like a little heads up,</v>

2755
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>he's able to see that helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wanted to do a seminar to a </v>

2756
02:02:49.390 --> 02:02:54.071
<v Speaker 1>certain date and he'll look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charts and he'll just say energy is </v>

2757
02:02:54.071 --> 02:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>pretty off that.</v>

2758
02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does that mean?</v>

2759
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>The energy is pretty often looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the charts.</v>

2760
02:02:56.841 --> 02:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2761
02:02:57.921 --> 02:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be tired.</v>

2762
02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen these charts,</v>

2763
02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but I hear them clicking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and the computer that guys on</v>

2764
02:03:05.631 --> 02:03:08.810
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's looking at pictures going on.</v>

2765
02:03:08.811 --> 02:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You just checking out girls assets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GimMe a call.</v>

2766
02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.840
<v Speaker 1>No fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2767
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2768
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time is not.</v>

2769
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Time is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's a guy in the world </v>

2770
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that can look at a chart and tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the energy of the world is.</v>

2771
02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there is man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2772
02:03:23.841 --> 02:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy know you.</v>

2773
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm questioning this wacky </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's out of a suitcase.</v>

2774
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's enough to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a beautiful,</v>

2775
02:03:36.921 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>brilliant man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2776
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:40.280
<v Speaker 1>if I was your friend and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am your friend,</v>

2777
02:03:40.281 --> 02:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but if I was there while this was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2778
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I would be asking this guy a fuck load </v>
<v Speaker 1>of questions.</v>

2779
02:03:45.710 --> 02:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I do find he's a really good guys I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to about stuff too.</v>

2780
02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>He's almost like a kinda like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist or a psychiatrist in a way </v>

2781
02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>is like an ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scientists were philosophers and all</v>

2782
02:03:57.731 --> 02:04:00.680
<v Speaker 1>the great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Alexander the Great and you know,</v>

2783
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:03.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the great Roman emperors,</v>

2784
02:04:03.411 --> 02:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2785
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.330
<v Speaker 1>they would have their own private </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers to advise them on things.</v>

2786
02:04:08.331 --> 02:04:13.331
<v Speaker 1>Mark Israelis for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would listen to these </v>

2787
02:04:13.331 --> 02:04:15.941
<v Speaker 1>philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of look at this guy almost as a </v>

2788
02:04:15.941 --> 02:04:15.941
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an advisor,</v>

2789
02:04:15.941 --> 02:04:17.660
<v Speaker 1>an advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can buy that.</v>

2790
02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I haven't always taken and I have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the guy.</v>

2791
02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't listen to what he said,</v>

2792
02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get my advice.</v>

2793
02:04:26.061 --> 02:04:31.061
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the seminar this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would he tell you not to do a </v>

2794
02:04:31.061 --> 02:04:31.061
<v Speaker 1>seminar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2795
02:04:31.061 --> 02:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a better day to do it in </v>

2796
02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>

2797
02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

2798
02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you know it's Voodoo because he threw </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken bones in the ground and one of </v>

2799
02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:43.821
<v Speaker 1>the sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have done it and it would be not such </v>

2800
02:04:43.831 --> 02:04:48.831
<v Speaker 1>a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he told you that it was going to </v>

2801
02:04:48.831 --> 02:04:48.831
<v Speaker 1>be a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had it in your head.</v>

2802
02:04:48.831 --> 02:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Then you went and did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2803
02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Has He ever told you not to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

2804
02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>He did and it worked out awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2805
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what made me think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2806
02:04:55.681 --> 02:05:00.681
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we talked about with negative </v>

2807
02:05:00.681 --> 02:05:04.521
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe more likely than a fucking </v>

2808
02:05:04.521 --> 02:05:08.570
<v Speaker 1>chart can tell you the energy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe doesn't want you to fly to </v>

2809
02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2810
02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>There's some pretty brilliant guys out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that,</v>

2811
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that knows stuff that we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2812
02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2813
02:05:16.561 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some brilliant stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know,</v>

2814
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:24.680
<v Speaker 1>but this one guy that's got a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can tap into the collective energy </v>

2815
02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:27.180
<v Speaker 1>of the universe and tell you where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the energy is and what.</v>

2816
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:29.790
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely not go to Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at your charts.</v>

2817
02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'd say to that guy.</v>

2818
02:05:31.921 --> 02:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't you crazy man?</v>

2819
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Haven't you ever gone and done a set in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show and it just kind of bombed,</v>

2820
02:05:38.881 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't work out that if anything</v>

2821
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:44.340
<v Speaker 1>ever went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of reasons why it went</v>

2822
02:05:44.341 --> 02:05:48.960
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I could look at all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say maybe I was tired,</v>

2823
02:05:49.110 --> 02:05:51.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was overworked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't prepare well enough.</v>

2824
02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I have new material that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out,</v>

2825
02:05:54.271 --> 02:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because I shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone to Ohio.</v>

2826
02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because some guy shows me a </v>

2827
02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>chart and the collective energy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is that,</v>

2828
02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but just maybe there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy in particular that could </v>

2829
02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 1>potentially write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have seen that for sure.</v>

2830
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>What the set going back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you want to have a hold on a </v>

2831
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>second because this is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2832
02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>where do you want to have a method that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would clearly understand how this </v>

2833
02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:26.730
<v Speaker 1>guy's making these arbitrary decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and choices?</v>

2834
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about bullshit.</v>

2835
02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like Voodoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2836
02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and if you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not bullshit,</v>

2837
02:06:33.331 --> 02:06:34.920
<v Speaker 1>then it's science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's science,</v>

2838
02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:39.921
<v Speaker 1>it's repeatable and you should bring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people that are experts and they </v>

2839
02:06:39.921 --> 02:06:43.131
<v Speaker 1>should analyze it and study it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for this guy to just sit there and </v>

2840
02:06:43.131 --> 02:06:43.530
<v Speaker 1>click on some things and tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go to Ohio.</v>

2841
02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.180
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2842
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>all I can say is this work for me so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

2843
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>The proof is in the pudding as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>

2844
02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

2845
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Your mind decides that something will </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out well and you have full </v>

2846
02:06:56.750 --> 02:07:01.101
<v Speaker 1>confidence and your playing doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by a meteor and everybody gets out </v>

2847
02:07:01.101 --> 02:07:03.420
<v Speaker 1>alive and at the end of the seminar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the trip that you took,</v>

2848
02:07:03.630 --> 02:07:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2849
02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:07.050
<v Speaker 1>that guy's advice really turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2850
02:07:07.050 --> 02:07:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you've done,</v>

2851
02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You basically give yourself a little </v>

2852
02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>mental shield to go into battle with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2853
02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>there we go with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>

2854
02:07:14.221 --> 02:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

2855
02:07:15.871 --> 02:07:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Plus I have that mental shield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it though?</v>

2856
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is real.</v>

2857
02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>It is in the sense that it was effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you had confidence in it and </v>

2858
02:07:25.670 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>because you approached all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>events like you had confidence in it,</v>

2859
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>but is it real in that there's a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually can look at a computer and tell</v>

2860
02:07:33.841 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 1>you whether or not you should go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere based on the energy</v>

2861
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.510
<v Speaker 3>of the universe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2862
02:07:37.690 --> 02:07:38.680
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not real.</v>

2863
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:43.950
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you with 100 percent </v>

2864
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:46.171
<v Speaker 3>confidence it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how I know it's not real </v>

2865
02:07:46.171 --> 02:07:46.360
<v Speaker 3>because there are millions of brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>people out there,</v>

2866
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:51.361
<v Speaker 3>millions of scientists and Co and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about quantum physicists and </v>

2867
02:07:51.361 --> 02:07:51.361
<v Speaker 3>theorists and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2868
02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:56.460
<v Speaker 3>They would have heard of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about the guy who's </v>

2869
02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 3>making a computer program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would analyze this.</v>

2870
02:07:56.771 --> 02:07:58.690
<v Speaker 3>It would be something that people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be talking about.</v>

2871
02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:01.650
<v Speaker 3>If this guy really believes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't just be holding onto it.</v>

2872
02:08:01.651 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 3>In Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be telling the world,</v>

2873
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:08.251
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a way where you can accurately </v>

2874
02:08:08.251 --> 02:08:08.251
<v Speaker 3>predict events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a way in you.</v>

2875
02:08:08.251 --> 02:08:10.750
<v Speaker 3>It would be up to peer review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would be studying it,</v>

2876
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:15.900
<v Speaker 3>they would be putting out papers on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be something where we would </v>

2877
02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:15.900
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have figured out a code,</v>

2878
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.310
<v Speaker 3>whether it's like the fibonacci sequence</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>

2879
02:08:18.311 --> 02:08:21.100
<v Speaker 3>a code to the universe and if you follow</v>
<v Speaker 3>this code,</v>

2880
02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you have predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatable events.</v>

2881
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 3>How do we know that there aren't a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people are doing it is the problem.</v>

2882
02:08:27.881 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this phrasing that you're using,</v>

2883
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:34.651
<v Speaker 3>how do we know it could be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be it's not enough to base your</v>

2884
02:08:34.991 --> 02:08:39.991
<v Speaker 3>life and any decisions and this will </v>
<v Speaker 3>will bullshit that comes along with </v>

2885
02:08:39.991 --> 02:08:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Tarot card reading with palm reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all that stuff.</v>

2886
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:46.120
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same and it's all one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person telling you.</v>

2887
02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:51.180
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's telling you stuff you already knew </v>

2888
02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:51.180
<v Speaker 3>about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2889
02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:54.750
<v Speaker 3>This is the strategy of charlatans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what Tarot card readers </v>

2890
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:57.070
<v Speaker 3>do and palm readers do and fortune </v>
<v Speaker 3>tellers do.</v>

2891
02:08:57.250 --> 02:09:02.250
<v Speaker 3>They tell you shit they are that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>already know and they tell you it </v>

2892
02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:05.611
<v Speaker 3>through leading questions and they tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you it through a bunch of signs that </v>

2893
02:09:05.611 --> 02:09:07.600
<v Speaker 3>they can tell for being really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading people.</v>

2894
02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Then they go on to tell you what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen or what you should and </v>

2895
02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.951
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in doing that you can plant some </v>

2896
02:09:16.951 --> 02:09:18.130
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and seeds of doubt into </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's head.</v>

2897
02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:23.340
<v Speaker 3>This is the reason why people used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that someone could put a hex on </v>

2898
02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.101
<v Speaker 3>you because if I put a hex on you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe I put a hex on you and you </v>

2899
02:09:26.101 --> 02:09:27.810
<v Speaker 3>leave this room and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am fucked Joe.</v>

2900
02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Just put a hex on me and we went around </v>
<v Speaker 3>in life.</v>

2901
02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 3>That will be overwhelming your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you allow that to happen,</v>

2902
02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:39.660
<v Speaker 3>it will be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can manifest bad things by having </v>

2903
02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:43.831
<v Speaker 3>bad energy and bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly what you were talking </v>

2904
02:09:43.831 --> 02:09:46.630
<v Speaker 3>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is done through like a strategy</v>

2905
02:09:46.631 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 3>and a in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

2906
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.660
<v Speaker 3>in a repeatable pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2907
02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say is maybe it works.</v>

2908
02:09:52.650 --> 02:09:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2909
02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Crazy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not as crazy as just say.</v>

2910
02:09:58.110 --> 02:09:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely crazy.</v>

2911
02:09:59.650 --> 02:10:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certified crazy.</v>

2912
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2913
02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.840
<v Speaker 3>if there's a method to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if this guy says,</v>

2914
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:06.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the reason why,</v>

2915
02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 3>the reason why is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2916
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:12.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the golden sequence of the universe</v>

2917
02:10:12.641 --> 02:10:17.641
<v Speaker 3>and you can tap that golden sequence </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a computer and it's based upon all </v>

2918
02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:22.051
<v Speaker 3>these different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that guy has information like that </v>

2919
02:10:22.051 --> 02:10:25.141
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just holding onto it and Maui or </v>

2920
02:10:25.141 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck he is and he travels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

2921
02:10:25.370 --> 02:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nomad by the way.</v>

2923
02:10:28.181 --> 02:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Someone who went to Stanford and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professor,</v>

2924
02:10:30.041 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't exclude them from being out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their fucking mind.</v>

2925
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Dr Oz is on TV</v>

2926
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.990
<v Speaker 2>and he's telling people about weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss medication.</v>

2927
02:10:35.991 --> 02:10:40.991
<v Speaker 2>That's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that fucking guy had to go to </v>

2928
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:40.991
<v Speaker 2>Congress about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

2929
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:44.710
<v Speaker 2>He still on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys on TV telling people about </v>

2930
02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.760
<v Speaker 2>miracle weightloss fucking berries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>

2931
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a charlatan,</v>

2932
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:50.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tons and tons and tons of guys out there</v>

2933
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:50.990
<v Speaker 2>selling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2934
02:10:50.991 --> 02:10:52.850
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this kind of stuff as you know,</v>

2935
02:10:52.851 --> 02:10:57.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty much an anti supplement guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just feel you used to take a lot </v>

2936
02:10:57.851 --> 02:11:01.661
<v Speaker 2>of sort of $120 worth of supplements a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month and I didn't notice a damn thing </v>

2937
02:11:02.871 --> 02:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>when I stopped taking all of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one thing.</v>

2938
02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:09.320
<v Speaker 2>In fact I felt better felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2939
02:11:09.730 --> 02:11:11.520
<v Speaker 2>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2940
02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:16.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this is placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there is some but there's also </v>

2941
02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:20.561
<v Speaker 2>some that's been proven by science to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have beneficial effects on a lot of </v>

2942
02:11:20.561 --> 02:11:20.561
<v Speaker 2>different factors.</v>

2943
02:11:20.561 --> 02:11:25.270
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a guy who's a healthy active guy </v>

2944
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:27.350
<v Speaker 2>who's constantly eating correctly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not allow yourself,</v>

2945
02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 2>streamlines strict with the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that on the road?</v>

2946
02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in in these different places</v>

2947
02:11:33.441 --> 02:11:38.441
<v Speaker 2>and like say if you're traveling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and you might not even speak </v>

2948
02:11:38.441 --> 02:11:41.171
<v Speaker 2>the language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you make sure that you get the </v>

2949
02:11:41.171 --> 02:11:41.171
<v Speaker 2>right food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2950
02:11:41.171 --> 02:11:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I try to always keep the quality is best</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

2951
02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:45.080
<v Speaker 2>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a frequent traveler yourself,</v>

2952
02:11:45.081 --> 02:11:50.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't always get the best quality </v>

2953
02:11:50.081 --> 02:11:52.631
<v Speaker 2>stuff talking about placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't let it get me bombed out.</v>

2954
02:11:53.130 --> 02:11:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to start thinking negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

2955
02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:57.080
<v Speaker 2>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say for example,</v>

2956
02:11:57.081 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I have to eat a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2957
02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bag of pretzels or something.</v>

2958
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe I can sublimate any ill effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that food and that just just by being</v>

2959
02:12:07.701 --> 02:12:10.400
<v Speaker 2>grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by visualizing my body,</v>

2960
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:13.310
<v Speaker 2>being able to respond well to the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just calories,</v>

2961
02:12:13.311 --> 02:12:18.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see myself digesting it and </v>

2962
02:12:18.311 --> 02:12:20.150
<v Speaker 2>assimilating it and I won't let it </v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively negatively affect me.</v>

2963
02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.890
<v Speaker 2>You just look at it as raw cowers </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters,</v>

2964
02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's some starch.</v>

2965
02:12:24.381 --> 02:12:29.381
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best stuff in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I'm going to be eating </v>

2966
02:12:29.381 --> 02:12:32.321
<v Speaker 2>that as a habit and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fine because you can work </v>

2967
02:12:32.321 --> 02:12:32.530
<v Speaker 2>yourself up into like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2968
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real negative thing.</v>

2969
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was younger,</v>

2970
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2971
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:44.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught me a lot about higher mind </v>

2972
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:46.541
<v Speaker 2>science and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in a restaurant one time </v>

2973
02:12:46.541 --> 02:12:48.761
<v Speaker 2>together and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe in the late seventies and </v>

2974
02:12:48.761 --> 02:12:49.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy smoking this is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people could still smoke.</v>

2975
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys bought in to smoke on me and </v>

2976
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting madder by the minute is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really pissing me off.</v>

2977
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So I asked the guy if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

2978
02:12:56.430 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he would please not blow smoke over </v>

2979
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

2980
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:04.690
<v Speaker 2>And the guys started doing it even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to punch the guy right in </v>

2981
02:13:04.690 --> 02:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2982
02:13:04.891 --> 02:13:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at my friend Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's totally relaxed.</v>

2983
02:13:09.591 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the whole thing.</v>

2984
02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:12.440
<v Speaker 2>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't that bother you?</v>

2985
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that really aggravate you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2986
02:13:14.691 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get yourself all worked up because I</v>

2987
02:13:16.731 --> 02:13:19.220
<v Speaker 2>can sublimate the bad effects of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke,</v>

2988
02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 2>but not letting it get to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2989
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:26.830
<v Speaker 2>all those negative emotions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger and upset your feeling are 10 </v>

2990
02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:28.850
<v Speaker 2>times worse than any amount of cigarette</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke blowing on you.</v>

2991
02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:34.600
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually doing harm by the way </v>

2992
02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:37.191
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about it as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual harms the smokes doing and </v>

2993
02:13:37.191 --> 02:13:40.941
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blew me away and I've seen him so </v>

2994
02:13:40.941 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2995
02:13:41.190 --> 02:13:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that's probably everything in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started looking at food the same </v>

2996
02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:46.190
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2997
02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2998
02:13:47.281 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 2>if you eat something that may be you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2999
02:13:49.021 --> 02:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>isn't the best quality because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just no other thing available.</v>

3000
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

3001
02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.680
<v Speaker 2>You'll be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3002
02:13:55.740 --> 02:14:00.420
<v Speaker 2>you just go back to eating a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good quality stuff after that.</v>

3003
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:04.140
<v Speaker 2>It's what you do most of the time is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the kid.</v>

3004
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Not What happens upon occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will say this as a,</v>

3005
02:14:08.250 --> 02:14:13.250
<v Speaker 2>as a full time traveler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will pack my own food as much as I </v>

3006
02:14:13.250 --> 02:14:16.671
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always carry it like a little grocery </v>

3007
02:14:16.671 --> 02:14:16.671
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3008
02:14:16.671 --> 02:14:19.341
<v Speaker 2>I was just telling your instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend got food confiscated and</v>

3009
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:25.790
<v Speaker 2>what did they confiscate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times you can't take anything </v>

3010
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:27.570
<v Speaker 2>that looks at little liquidity through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the security.</v>

3011
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll grab fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:31.830
<v Speaker 2>like going from Mali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the mainland,</v>

3013
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:35.330
<v Speaker 2>all the fruit and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any fresh produce they will.</v>

3014
02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 2>They'll take a for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a salad,</v>

3015
02:14:37.981 --> 02:14:39.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3016
02:14:39.071 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 2>the lenders was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they wanted the tomatoes,</v>

3017
02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:45.690
<v Speaker 2>the cucumbers off that would impasse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3018
02:14:45.691 --> 02:14:48.720
<v Speaker 2>The Department of Agriculture Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of Buddha,</v>

3019
02:14:48.721 --> 02:14:53.721
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just the craziest thing they </v>

3020
02:14:53.721 --> 02:14:53.721
<v Speaker 2>asked the just why I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3021
02:14:53.721 --> 02:14:58.371
<v Speaker 2>he had no real format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never have an explanation for it </v>

3022
02:14:58.371 --> 02:14:58.430
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just band or whatever.</v>

3023
02:14:58.431 --> 02:14:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain flies.</v>

3024
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attracted to the liquid,</v>

3025
02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.940
<v Speaker 2>be attracted to the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3026
02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:11.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually I don't have too much trouble </v>

3027
02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:11.060
<v Speaker 2>getting stuff through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny,</v>

3028
02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:14.600
<v Speaker 2>some countries are so amazingly lax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whereabouts is the Australia?</v>

3029
02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:17.850
<v Speaker 2>He could take liquids through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

3030
02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3031
02:15:18.871 --> 02:15:20.250
<v Speaker 2>you can take water and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

3032
02:15:20.251 --> 02:15:23.190
<v Speaker 2>but you can't take a dogged Australia to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what happened with Johnny.</v>

3033
02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp is still in trouble with </v>

3034
02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:28.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3035
02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Did you see his video that he made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>

3036
02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:31.160
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be really fun.</v>

3037
02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.550
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious because he mock serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked through his video,</v>

3038
02:15:35.551 --> 02:15:36.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3039
02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:41.031
<v Speaker 2>he's an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he made it look like he was being </v>

3040
02:15:41.031 --> 02:15:44.121
<v Speaker 2>serious but did so in a way where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty obvious to anyone watching that </v>

3041
02:15:44.121 --> 02:15:48.820
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was so subtle that one of the </v>

3042
02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main people in Australia </v>

3043
02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>actually had a comment on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3044
02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:56.730
<v Speaker 2>how it's pretty obvious that he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it seriously and made this video.</v>

3045
02:15:56.820 --> 02:16:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird what we'll go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>security and what won't,</v>

3046
02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3047
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 2>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were absolutely scrupulous.</v>

3048
02:16:06.121 --> 02:16:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how good this girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that screen.</v>

3049
02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:13.110
<v Speaker 2>She got all my little secret shit I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do all carry on now.</v>

3050
02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't check bags anymore.</v>

3051
02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a little key that's actually a </v>

3052
02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:20.070
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It opened up into a little night because</v>

3053
02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you didn't need a blade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3054
02:16:21.190 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3055
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:26.550
<v Speaker 2>you always could use a blade no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are to cut stuff or whatever.</v>

3056
02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>You just always have a need for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She found that kid,</v>

3057
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how the hell she knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was a knife.</v>

3058
02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:33.630
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3059
02:16:34.090 --> 02:16:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I carry like little survival tools with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3060
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:41.041
<v Speaker 2>I have like a little flint still </v>
<v Speaker 2>firestarter sometimes when you start </v>

3061
02:16:41.041 --> 02:16:44.761
<v Speaker 2>firing a fucking Zombie apocalypse ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up.</v>

3062
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Does your astrologer telling you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to carry that around that.</v>

3063
02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.100
<v Speaker 2>But I watched the walking dead fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the walking dead,</v>

3064
02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:53.220
<v Speaker 2>speaking of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3065
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:58.120
<v Speaker 2>creating a mental but also have like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those little drinking straws.</v>

3066
02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a filter.</v>

3067
02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You can actually drink a ton 40.</v>

3068
02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3069
02:17:04.181 --> 02:17:05.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw that,</v>

3070
02:17:05.670 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>remember the tsunami hit badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that resort,</v>

3071
02:17:07.770 --> 02:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in places like that and I just </v>

3072
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>figured better safe than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3073
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that,</v>

3074
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3075
02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 2>my astrologer will keep me safe from </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

3076
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:24.360
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say we would have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where the water would be </v>

3077
02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:27.541
<v Speaker 2>really shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been in like places like a </v>

3078
02:17:27.541 --> 02:17:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Novosibirsk in Russia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's like in the middle of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>

3080
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:36.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there would be any kind of natural </v>

3081
02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:36.780
<v Speaker 2>disaster or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I know I can drink.</v>

3082
02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3083
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I also have a little magnifying </v>

<v Speaker 2>I always have a compass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3099
02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:11.260
<v Speaker 2>bring a company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3100
02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:16.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as old school I've learned how to use a </v>

3101
02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:16.261
<v Speaker 2>map and accomplishment as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a boy scout.</v>

3102
02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:18.600
<v Speaker 2>You do orienteering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew how to do the uh,</v>

3103
02:18:18.610 --> 02:18:19.400
<v Speaker 2>the knots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3104
02:18:19.401 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>my little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're going to these places,</v>

3105
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:25.960
<v Speaker 2>like say if you get an offer to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some strange place in Siberia,</v>

3106
02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:30.820
<v Speaker 2>are you reluctant to take any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the just like anybody who wants to do</v>

3107
02:18:30.821 --> 02:18:31.390
<v Speaker 2>a seminar?</v>

3108
02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm open for the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much open for the journey.</v>

3109
02:18:33.671 --> 02:18:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I like to go to different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3110
02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:37.170
<v Speaker 2>But in China there's last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

3111
02:18:37.171 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 2>they were taking my to fricken nail </v>
<v Speaker 2>clippers,</v>

3112
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:41.410
<v Speaker 2>nail clippers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found that little key.</v>

3113
02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:44.890
<v Speaker 2>They took my little fire starter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How she even knew what that shit was.</v>

3114
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must be well trained because she </v>

3115
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:51.370
<v Speaker 2>nailed me for everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3116
02:18:51.371 --> 02:18:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And then you get in trouble when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nail you for that.</v>

3117
02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 2>They just take it because none of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be considered a weapon.</v>

3118
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was arrested in Switzerland one time.</v>

3119
02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I had been traveling by train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one of those.</v>

3120
02:19:03.810 --> 02:19:08.320
<v Speaker 2>A Gerber or was it cold still?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a knife.</v>

3121
02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:12.020
<v Speaker 2>The spring assisted rock climbers use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

3122
02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.950
<v Speaker 2>if you're rock climbing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>harnessed gets tangled,</v>

3123
02:19:15.250 --> 02:19:16.840
<v Speaker 2>you may have to.</v>

3124
02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:19.890
<v Speaker 2>You have to hold on to cut yourself free</v>
<v Speaker 2>from your harness,</v>

3125
02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:21.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need a knife,</v>

3126
02:19:21.221 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 2>you can easily open up with one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just liked it.</v>

3127
02:19:24.461 --> 02:19:29.461
<v Speaker 2>It was a great little knife and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been by train and had it in my </v>

3128
02:19:29.481 --> 02:19:34.481
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little man purse carry on thing and </v>

3129
02:19:34.481 --> 02:19:37.541
<v Speaker 2>forgot about the damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it went through and they pull me </v>

3130
02:19:38.061 --> 02:19:39.810
<v Speaker 2>aside and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3131
02:19:39.811 --> 02:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>they pulled that knife out of there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3132
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said in Switzerland,</v>

3133
02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:47.570
<v Speaker 2>a assistant opening night is considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>a weapon.</v>

3134
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:51.680
<v Speaker 2>And the place took me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat there,</v>

3135
02:19:51.681 --> 02:19:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I almost missed my plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3136
02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:54.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3137
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:59.070
<v Speaker 2>they obviously were going on Interpol </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing all this bullshit to find out </v>

3138
02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:01.610
<v Speaker 2>who I was and what I'm doing with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>

3139
02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:06.940
<v Speaker 2>While to add insult to injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also had like a little credit card </v>

3140
02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:09.380
<v Speaker 2>thing and it also had like a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>teeny blade in it.</v>

3141
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.970
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3142
02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 2>multi-tool in the shape of a credit </v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

3143
02:20:13.610 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So they found two blades in my freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry on.</v>

3144
02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I could have got away with a credit card</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they wouldn't have even looked </v>

3145
02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:24.491
<v Speaker 2>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once they found one thing that tore </v>

3146
02:20:24.491 --> 02:20:24.491
<v Speaker 2>my shit apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at everything.</v>

3147
02:20:24.491 --> 02:20:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird,</v>

3148
02:20:26.331 --> 02:20:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Australia,</v>

3149
02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.560
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to take off your </v>

3150
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:32.560
<v Speaker 2>shoes most places you don't have to grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>up shoes,</v>

3151
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:35.960
<v Speaker 2>but us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still do fingernail clippers.</v>

3152
02:20:35.961 --> 02:20:38.900
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff goes through even small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even small knives,</v>

3153
02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even bat an eyelash </v>

3154
02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:45.551
<v Speaker 2>multi-tool we can take through Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're looking for stuff like </v>

3155
02:20:45.551 --> 02:20:45.680
<v Speaker 2>liquid and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3156
02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 2>any kind of shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronics.</v>

3157
02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:50.000
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times I saw them this past </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3158
02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm making them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3159

<v Speaker 2>could turn on a saw a number of that </v>

3160
02:20:57.100 --> 02:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one dude tried to slip a bomb </v>

3161
02:21:01.350 --> 02:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>through the laptop.</v>

3162

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like crazy internationally mean or just </v>

3164
02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.220
<v Speaker 2>even within the US?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems normal.</v>

3165
02:21:10.530 --> 02:21:15.200
<v Speaker 2>It's always value is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At lax was absolutely awful.</v>

3166
02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3167
02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:21.100

<v Speaker 2>actually boarded a plane with no </v>

3168
02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:23.460
<v Speaker 2>credentials are boarding pass one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>

3169
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read like a Bang News.</v>

3170
02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I usually read the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to read the actual news </v>

3171
02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:31.850
<v Speaker 2>because it's always talk about negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>

3172
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I just look at the headlines just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

3173
02:21:34.281 --> 02:21:39.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give me a clue like what's going </v>

3174
02:21:39.281 --> 02:21:39.281
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I be scared of.</v>

3175
02:21:39.281 --> 02:21:39.281
<v Speaker 2>What new virus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3176
02:21:39.281 --> 02:21:40.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never read that shit,</v>

3177
02:21:40.401 --> 02:21:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but I do like to read travel stuff just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what the latest and greatest is,</v>

3178
02:21:44.121 --> 02:21:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3179
02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a new,</v>

3180
02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it hit international news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3181
02:21:48.741 --> 02:21:49.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>

3182
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:55.270
<v Speaker 2>She actually went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the whole way through and the word </v>

3183
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:58.781
<v Speaker 2>came down because TSA was already under </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire basically just for being </v>

3184
02:21:58.781 --> 02:21:59.750
<v Speaker 2>incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3185
02:21:59.751 --> 02:22:00.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

3186
02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman got through and now all of a </v>

3187
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:06.060
<v Speaker 2>sudden now this will be going on for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next month or two.</v>

3188
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:07.880
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3189
02:22:07.970 --> 02:22:09.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the travel is so delayed.</v>

3190
02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling a lot.</v>

3191
02:22:11.361 --> 02:22:13.430
<v Speaker 2>It seems totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always sucks.</v>

3192
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually go pre,</v>

3193
02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:21.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last time I took the budget spirit </v>

3194
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:23.180
<v Speaker 2>airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any contract with TSA so</v>

3195
02:22:23.181 --> 02:22:25.890
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes through like the long ass</v>

3196
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.830
<v Speaker 1>security lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the best things I ever did,</v>

3197
02:22:28.831 --> 02:22:33.831
<v Speaker 1>I did global entry and I can just walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through like a freaking Rockstar when I </v>

3198
02:22:33.831 --> 02:22:35.780
<v Speaker 1>come into jetpack.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of our lives,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you could give a ticket to a friend.</v>

3210
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:05.160
<v Speaker 1>That friend could go on the plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of you.</v>

3211
02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>

3216
02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was none of that kind of stuff.</v>

3217
02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:15.030
<v Speaker 1>So this astrologer told you to move to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maui,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gonna follow his advice.</v>

3219
02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:18.380
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go there and I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3220
02:23:18.390 --> 02:23:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm setting up a little home base to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>

3221
02:23:22.170 --> 02:23:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll start travel somewhat due to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>seminars,</v>

3222
02:23:25.321 --> 02:23:30.321
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to set up a shop and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was thinking for a guy like </v>

3223
02:23:30.321 --> 02:23:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would come to you,</v>

3224
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:36.630
<v Speaker 1>like it might not be a bad idea to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>family van Damn Nice place to attract,</v>

3225
02:23:36.631 --> 02:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could set up seminars on a </v>

3227
02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:44.190
<v Speaker 1>weekly basis and do them literally from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comfort of your own home.</v>

3228
02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>You could just have a program where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>run people out of Malibu and make a </v>

3229
02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>great living or Maui rather and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go back and forth if you so choose.</v>

3230
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:59.150
<v Speaker 1>You could kind of go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you did do that and you could </v>

3231
02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:00.420
<v Speaker 1>establish your own gymnasium and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a real gym there.</v>

3232
02:24:01.470 --> 02:24:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Would you start changing your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>training?</v>

3233
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Because I know a lot of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now is mostly by way back,</v>

3234
02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:08.370
<v Speaker 1>get back to some of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3235
02:24:08.371 --> 02:24:09.340
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3236
02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>like what I liked the clubs that I club </v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging.</v>

3237
02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I like swinging the light clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3238
02:24:15.031 --> 02:24:20.031
<v Speaker 1>just as a mobility thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes my elbows and shoulders and </v>

3239
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:20.031
<v Speaker 1>wrist feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

3240
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 1>The little one pound Indian clubs I used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3241
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I used to be quite the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3242
02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I actually learned that as a physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>education major in college real as a </v>

3243
02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:30.060
<v Speaker 1>freshman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3244
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:34.440
<v Speaker 1>as all pe majors had to learn basic old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school physical culture systems.</v>

3245
02:24:34.650 --> 02:24:37.840
<v Speaker 1>And one of those was the old wooden club</v>
<v Speaker 1>system back in the day,</v>

3246
02:24:37.841 --> 02:24:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3247
02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a 1970 when I went through the </v>

3248
02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:43.980
<v Speaker 1>school of Health and physical education </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Westchester.</v>

3249
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting that now 40 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

3250
02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:48.430
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of training modalities are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back.</v>

3251
02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3252
02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.790
<v Speaker 1>so old is new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3253
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the little kettle bells is a </v>

3254
02:24:55.850 --> 02:24:55.850
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3255
02:24:55.850 --> 02:24:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Page example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3256
02:24:55.850 --> 02:24:57.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was old school training tool.</v>

3257
02:24:57.450 --> 02:24:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they came from Germany,</v>

3258
02:24:58.861 --> 02:24:59.480
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3259
02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 1>not Russia really at the Germans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that actually established.</v>

3260
02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.460
<v Speaker 1>He called him ringlets in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

3261
02:25:05.461 --> 02:25:10.461
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the old German strong men use </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and it looked the same like a </v>

3262
02:25:10.461 --> 02:25:11.430
<v Speaker 1>cannon ball with the handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a condo.</v>

3263
02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:13.920
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>designs.</v>

3264
02:25:13.921 --> 02:25:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Some of them really like circle just on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cannon ball,</v>

3265
02:25:17.371 --> 02:25:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to use real heavy ones in,</v>

3266
02:25:20.381 --> 02:25:25.381
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were hollow and he would </v>

3267
02:25:25.381 --> 02:25:25.381
<v Speaker 1>unscrew it</v>

3268
02:25:25.381 --> 02:25:27.250
<v Speaker 2>and they would put weight inside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it back on.</v>

3269
02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.620
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3270
02:25:28.621 --> 02:25:29.620
<v Speaker 2>so you can adjust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3271
02:25:29.621 --> 02:25:34.420
<v Speaker 2>like adjustable weights and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had your own gym and you could do</v>

3272
02:25:34.421 --> 02:25:36.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want and lift weights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3273
02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:38.980
<v Speaker 2>what would you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you set it up?</v>

3274
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:40.300
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like standard,</v>

3275
02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:43.630
<v Speaker 2>like Olympic style weight lifting type </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises,</v>

3276
02:25:43.631 --> 02:25:45.790
<v Speaker 2>or never been a real fan of Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>weightlifting.</v>

3277
02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient way to train athletes and </v>

3278
02:25:50.850 --> 02:25:53.920
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of Ncaa a strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches and uh,</v>

3279
02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:55.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3280
02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>nfl strength coaches is shy more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more away from the Olympic lifts.</v>

3281
02:25:58.721 --> 02:26:03.721
<v Speaker 2>They're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're athletes just getting to busted </v>

3282
02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:03.721
<v Speaker 2>up and hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3283
02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:03.880
<v Speaker 2>even just doing a front squat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3284
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:06.560
<v Speaker 2>By our risk of million dollar athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3285
02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:11.020
<v Speaker 2>to teach them the Olympic lifting is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of a sport.</v>

3286
02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of coordination to Joe,</v>

3287
02:26:13.341 --> 02:26:14.390
<v Speaker 2>my big lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3288
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And as you well know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one sport doesn't make you better at </v>

3289
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.810
<v Speaker 2>another sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't.</v>

3290
02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:25.010
<v Speaker 2>It just causes motor learning confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that Olympic weight </v>

3291
02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:26.860
<v Speaker 2>lifters are incredible specimens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're strong,</v>

3292
02:26:27.010 --> 02:26:28.720
<v Speaker 2>they're fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're explosive,</v>

3293
02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:34.020
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doing Olympic lifting will make you </v>

3294
02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:35.740
<v Speaker 2>stronger and more explosive and fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like self selective.</v>

3295
02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:41.040
<v Speaker 2>The gods had already had those </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes to weld Olympic </v>

3296
02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.220
<v Speaker 2>weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I take a slow twitch wandering,</v>

3297
02:26:42.250 --> 02:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>give them Olympic lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't select.</v>

3298
02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:48.040
<v Speaker 2>We recruit those fast twitch muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers and make them at fast twitch guy.</v>

3299
02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:53.660
<v Speaker 2>A pride is going to get them hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was a wrestling coach or an mma </v>

3300
02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:58.171
<v Speaker 2>coach or a football coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be spending most of my </v>

3301
02:26:58.171 --> 02:26:59.800
<v Speaker 2>athletes time out practicing the skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sport,</v>

3302
02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:05.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skill of the sport and most of your </v>

3303
02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:07.660
<v Speaker 2>sports specific conditioning come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the practice of the sport itself.</v>

3304
02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to general strength training </v>

3305
02:27:13.470 --> 02:27:14.470
<v Speaker 2>program to make his skeletal muscle is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as strong as humanly possible.</v>

3306
02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:20.520
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to use modalities to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the idea is to keep it is,</v>

3307
02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:26.280
<v Speaker 2>is as safe as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see Olympic lifting is pretty on </v>

3308
02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:29.260
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lotta guys busted themselves</v>

3309
02:27:29.261 --> 02:27:30.370
<v Speaker 2>up hurting themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3310
02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a big fan.</v>

3311
02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:36.610
<v Speaker 2>So you're seeing motor learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion is the term?</v>

3312
02:27:36.611 --> 02:27:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes people think that a power</v>

3313
02:27:39.341 --> 02:27:41.530
<v Speaker 2>clean is like the snap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3314
02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.870
<v Speaker 2>finish off a AA pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown something,</v>

3315
02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:45.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's a completely different skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>

3316
02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:48.490
<v Speaker 2>One isn't going to make you better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the other.</v>

3317
02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think though that strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 2>your muscles and having more explosion </v>

3318
02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.191
<v Speaker 2>and more the ability to close the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance quicker from box jumps and </v>

3319
02:27:59.191 --> 02:28:03.241
<v Speaker 2>sprints and things along those lines can</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly translate to things like </v>

3320
02:28:03.241 --> 02:28:04.660
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think it's very specific.</v>

3321
02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing a box jump as a whole lot </v>

3322
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:09.660
<v Speaker 2>different than shit into double egg </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw.</v>

3323
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

3324
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:12.610
<v Speaker 2>The best way to get guys really </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive of doing that is just do those</v>

3325
02:28:12.611 --> 02:28:15.580
<v Speaker 2>things over and over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get really good at it.</v>

3326
02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:17.320
<v Speaker 2>That's very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3327
02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

3328
02:28:18.401 --> 02:28:21.530
<v Speaker 2>There's as many guys that a talk like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3329
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:25.040
<v Speaker 2>There's just as many guys that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue to the death the other way,</v>

3330
02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:26.960
<v Speaker 2>but I've done both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3331
02:28:26.961 --> 02:28:31.961
<v Speaker 2>as a young boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned Olympic weight lifting from </v>

3332
02:28:31.961 --> 02:28:34.490
<v Speaker 2>the last Olympic world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Bednarski.</v>

3333
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:39.790
<v Speaker 2>My Dad used to take me down to York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania when the United States was </v>

3334
02:28:39.790 --> 02:28:44.081
<v Speaker 2>still the Mecca for Olympic lifting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually learned Olympic lifting down </v>

3335
02:28:44.081 --> 02:28:44.510
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Old York Jim.</v>

3336
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3337
02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:49.630
<v Speaker 2>and I used to lift in my basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I've found even when I was just</v>

3338
02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.510
<v Speaker 2>in high school as a wrestler that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really helping that much and even</v>

3339
02:28:53.511 --> 02:28:58.511
<v Speaker 2>then I just sensed like a real danger to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body in wrestling is a tough sport as</v>

3340
02:29:01.041 --> 02:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3341
02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:05.210
<v Speaker 2>What your training should prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>

3342
02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:10.960
<v Speaker 2>If a person needs to foam roll and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>massages and is hurting themselves in </v>

3343
02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:14.840
<v Speaker 2>their supplementary training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong.</v>

3344
02:29:15.350 --> 02:29:20.120
<v Speaker 2>If it's really a good training modality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should prevent injuries not caused.</v>

3345
02:29:20.390 --> 02:29:25.390
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer in getting rid of </v>

3346
02:29:25.390 --> 02:29:25.390
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3347
02:29:25.390 --> 02:29:28.870
<v Speaker 2>of the dangerous stuff out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>training because uh,</v>

3348
02:29:28.980 --> 02:29:29.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we do,</v>

3349
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:34.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artists dangerous enough as it </v>

3350
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:34.990
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really controversial though.</v>

3351
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of really high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level strength and conditioning coaches </v>

3352
02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.061
<v Speaker 2>that think that strength training and </v>
<v Speaker 2>power training and things along those </v>

3353
02:29:43.061 --> 02:29:44.690
<v Speaker 2>lines actually improve all of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>

3354
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:46.490
<v Speaker 2>your skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a martial artist,</v>

3355
02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been strength training for 53 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3356
02:29:49.251 --> 02:29:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't find that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3357
02:29:51.291 --> 02:29:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but based on your own body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your own life,</v>

3358
02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:56.630
<v Speaker 2>but also with clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember I've trained literally hundreds</v>

3359
02:29:56.630 --> 02:30:01.630
<v Speaker 2>and hundreds if not thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years and I did find a good </v>

3360
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.630
<v Speaker 2>correlation.</v>

3361
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:05.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just interesting because in was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>men's journal,</v>

3362
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:10.210
<v Speaker 2>there was just an article by a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like one of the leading experts in </v>

3363
02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:15.700
<v Speaker 2>speech reading and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found that the thing that correlates </v>

3364
02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:20.170
<v Speaker 2>most to your ability to run fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a sprint a was the trap bar </v>

3365
02:30:20.850 --> 02:30:23.480
<v Speaker 2>deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried leg presses,</v>

3366
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:25.730
<v Speaker 2>cleans front squats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

3367
02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:30.970
<v Speaker 2>The thing that had the greatest transfer</v>
<v Speaker 2>into improving your,</v>

3368
02:30:31.071 --> 02:30:36.071
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to sprint was the trap bar </v>

3369
02:30:36.071 --> 02:30:36.071
<v Speaker 2>deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

3370
02:30:36.071 --> 02:30:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Just the way it positions the hips and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that the weight is centered,</v>

3371
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like instead of out in front of you </v>

3372
02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>where there's auto spinal sheering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3373
02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.330
<v Speaker 2>your hands are on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're almost inside the </v>

3374
02:30:49.330 --> 02:30:49.330
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3375
02:30:49.330 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way you hinge out in that trap </v>

3376
02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 2>bar deadlift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that.</v>

3377
02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 2>The only way I do them now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always felt just intuitively like </v>

3378
02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:00.800
<v Speaker 2>such a damn good exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>

3379
02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:02.670
<v Speaker 2>it was just in this month's issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3380
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it was men's journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My only feeling on trap bar deadlifts is</v>

3381
02:31:07.821 --> 02:31:12.821
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like I didn't get deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough because the 45 pound plates were </v>

3382
02:31:12.821 --> 02:31:12.821
<v Speaker 2>so large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3383
02:31:12.821 --> 02:31:17.380
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that much range of motion for </v>

3384
02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>sprinting because your legs aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really bend that much anyway.</v>

3385
02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of strengths in speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches,</v>

3386
02:31:22.801 --> 02:31:27.801
<v Speaker 2>like really well known guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now going against power cleans </v>

3387
02:31:27.801 --> 02:31:31.341
<v Speaker 2>front squats and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judge a Franco is really a famous </v>

3388
02:31:31.341 --> 02:31:31.341
<v Speaker 2>strength coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3389
02:31:31.390 --> 02:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>he won't risk the injury to his athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore of this stuff.</v>

3390
02:31:34.861 --> 02:31:37.770
<v Speaker 2>He's finding guys were messing up their </v>
<v Speaker 2>elbows or wrists,</v>

3391
02:31:37.771 --> 02:31:39.060
<v Speaker 2>their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3392
02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:42.590
<v Speaker 2>if you have a guy that's like top level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of deb away,</v>

3393
02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wide receiver or something,</v>

3394
02:31:45.330 --> 02:31:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you do not want to use risky modalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and risk hurting this guy because what </v>

3395
02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:53.910
<v Speaker 2>they do as an athlete is risky enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3396
02:31:53.970 --> 02:31:58.970
<v Speaker 2>out there in the way they run and sprint</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cut and so forth that they kind of </v>

3397
02:31:58.970 --> 02:31:59.880
<v Speaker 2>collisions that they have.</v>

3398
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You want to make that training is safest</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

3399
02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:05.880
<v Speaker 2>You want to make it as general as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible so they get,</v>

3400
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:08.400
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much strength transfer.</v>

3401
02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be fancy exercise it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3402
02:32:10.770 --> 02:32:12.000
<v Speaker 2>basically squat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hinge,</v>

3403
02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:12.810
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>

3404
02:32:12.811 --> 02:32:17.811
<v Speaker 2>horizontal and vertical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some type of rotation or anti rotation </v>

3405
02:32:17.811 --> 02:32:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and then work the ancillary muscles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the neck,</v>

3406
02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands,</v>

3407
02:32:20.131 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 2>the forums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grip,</v>

3408
02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:26.330
<v Speaker 2>and obviously the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calves and ankles are really neglected </v>

3409
02:32:26.330 --> 02:32:27.330
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of people's training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Week,</v>

3410
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:28.590
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak ankles.</v>

3411
02:32:28.591 --> 02:32:30.600
<v Speaker 2>And we'd have a lot of guys leave that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3412
02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And of course the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3413
02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how many guys I know the try </v>

3414
02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:38.460
<v Speaker 2>their neck is crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even your jaw,</v>

3415
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:41.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember watching Mohammed Ali,</v>

3416
02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:42.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3417
02:32:42.751 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 2>the old videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3418
02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:45.450
<v Speaker 2>they do like these little snippets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his training.</v>

3419
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>He used to do a lot of [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this really cool thing where he </v>

3420
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:51.180
<v Speaker 2>would take like a sling and hook it onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3421
02:32:51.181 --> 02:32:51.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3422
02:32:51.571 --> 02:32:56.571
<v Speaker 2>like a pull down and then he would open </v>
<v Speaker 2>his jaw against the resistance that is </v>

3423
02:32:57.091 --> 02:33:02.091
<v Speaker 2>freaking brilliant to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to strengthen the muscles of the jaw </v>

3424
02:33:02.091 --> 02:33:02.091
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3425
02:33:02.091 --> 02:33:02.760
<v Speaker 2>it's well known fact that if your jaw is</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

3426
02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:08.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot less chance of a </v>

3427
02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:08.080
<v Speaker 2>knockout.</v>

3428
02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of who used to chew beef jerky so </v>

3429
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:12.270
<v Speaker 2>as to strengthen their jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to chew bubblegum all the time</v>

3430
02:33:12.271 --> 02:33:12.690
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3431
02:33:12.691 --> 02:33:14.430
<v Speaker 2>your jaw gets tired when you have bubble</v>
<v Speaker 2>gum.</v>

3432
02:33:14.431 --> 02:33:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I get to the bubblegum gets old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just keep chewing on it.</v>

3433
02:33:17.251 --> 02:33:19.200
<v Speaker 2>And they would do that to keep their </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw strong.</v>

3434
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:20.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

3435
02:33:20.221 --> 02:33:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show,</v>

3436
02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:23.180
<v Speaker 2>you remember when we brought up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3437
02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Alexander's ass with the tif lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that bank.</v>

3438
02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I used to actually have a mouthpiece in </v>
<v Speaker 2>two teeth lifting when as a kid.</v>

3439
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:31.200
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3441
02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:33.250
<v Speaker 2>it was very popular back in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3442
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 2>teeth lifting for your neck and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaws.</v>

3443
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I used to lift my little sister up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used to lay down and I put the,</v>

3444
02:33:39.140 --> 02:33:44.140
<v Speaker 2>a little sling and a feeling on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>like neck harnesses with the chains </v>

3445
02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:46.190
<v Speaker 2>attached.</v>

3446
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:47.100
<v Speaker 2>You like those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3447
02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Entrepreneurial too because my trainer </v>

3448
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.150
<v Speaker 2>hates him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3449
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to be careful and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really crappy design,</v>

3450
02:33:53.701 --> 02:33:55.460
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hurt your ears and you know,</v>

3451
02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I already have qualifiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to make it any worse,</v>

3452
02:33:59.070 --> 02:34:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be good.</v>

3453
02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:05.331
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the best things ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented was the old nautilus for wide </v>

3454
02:34:05.331 --> 02:34:09.211
<v Speaker 2>neck machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a damn good piece of equipment </v>

3455
02:34:09.211 --> 02:34:09.211
<v Speaker 2>and later the hammer strength for way </v>
<v Speaker 2>net.</v>

3456
02:34:09.211 --> 02:34:10.620
<v Speaker 2>See those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like Kelly Starrett.</v>

3457
02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him about those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those neck machines.</v>

3458
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:14.300
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are terrible for you now.</v>

3459
02:34:14.310 --> 02:34:15.150
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3460
02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3461
02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know who to believe.</v>

3462
02:34:18.510 --> 02:34:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you gotta try it yourself.</v>

3463
02:34:20.170 --> 02:34:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I tell people to experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what works really well that</v>

3464
02:34:23.501 --> 02:34:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think would be too controversial</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anyone.</v>

3465
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Neck isom metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3466
02:34:27.821 --> 02:34:30.170
<v Speaker 2>You showed me those with a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't Tocqueville.</v>

3467
02:34:30.330 --> 02:34:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3468
02:34:31.371 --> 02:34:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Hixon used to do a lot of neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>isometrics.</v>

3469
02:34:33.071 --> 02:34:35.730
<v Speaker 2>He used to use that rubber band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3470
02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>he would walk back and just hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3471
02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like someone trying to pull </v>

3472
02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.001
<v Speaker 2>you down into a front headlock or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>front good team and then you go from </v>

3473
02:34:45.001 --> 02:34:49.861
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it on your forehead and on your </v>

3474
02:34:49.861 --> 02:34:49.861
<v Speaker 2>side and you to develop tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability.</v>

3475
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you know the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see where it can be </v>

3476
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:56.110
<v Speaker 2>controversial because it all comes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your technique,</v>

3477
02:34:56.111 --> 02:34:57.220
<v Speaker 2>your form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3478
02:34:57.221 --> 02:35:00.220
<v Speaker 2>if you're an idiot and you're using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of momentum and you know you're,</v>

3479
02:35:00.221 --> 02:35:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3480
02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you're using poor technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see where he can really mess </v>

3481
02:35:05.850 --> 02:35:06.790
<v Speaker 2>your neck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isometrics.</v>

3482
02:35:07.180 --> 02:35:08.560
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3483
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.770
<v Speaker 2>But excluding isometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those neck machines,</v>

3484
02:35:11.771 --> 02:35:14.050
<v Speaker 2>like moving your neck when those next </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine neck machines,</v>

3485
02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:19.380
<v Speaker 2>where do you think the problems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the problems lie and people </v>

3486
02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:19.380
<v Speaker 2>using momentum too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much weight,</v>

3487
02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:21.420
<v Speaker 2>too much momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not using good form.</v>

3488
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3489
02:35:22.331 --> 02:35:27.331
<v Speaker 2>We know that you can get really strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really fit using shitty technique </v>

3490
02:35:27.331 --> 02:35:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see it all over the gym.</v>

3491
02:35:29.021 --> 02:35:32.050
<v Speaker 2>You see huge guys seemed really muscular</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3492
02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Just thrown the crap out of the ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't necessarily mean it's the </v>

3493
02:35:37.350 --> 02:35:40.651
<v Speaker 2>best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of those guys don't stand the test </v>

3494
02:35:40.651 --> 02:35:40.651
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember earlier I was saying,</v>

3495
02:35:40.651 --> 02:35:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone under 60,</v>

3496
02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they haven't passed over,</v>

3497
02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:49.000
<v Speaker 2>of course that's pretty convenient for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me now somehow,</v>

3498
02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:51.490
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

3499
02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't been to the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff that I did in my </v>

3500
02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>early days.</v>

3501
02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:58.480
<v Speaker 2>No way that I would advocate that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

3502
02:35:58.481 --> 02:36:00.940
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was always a firm believer in work</v>

3503
02:36:00.941 --> 02:36:05.941
<v Speaker 2>in the neck and I used neck harnesses </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully using really good strict </v>

3504
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:07.990
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily heavy weight.</v>

3505
02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:12.520
<v Speaker 2>If you put yourself in by mechanically </v>
<v Speaker 2>in efficient position,</v>

3506
02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you can really work those muscles really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard with very,</v>

3507
02:36:15.731 --> 02:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>very safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you talk about neck,</v>

3508
02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:23.580
<v Speaker 2>neck harnesses and you lift your neck up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can lie on a bench and put a </v>

3509
02:36:24.311 --> 02:36:26.160
<v Speaker 2>plate on your head and lift your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

3510
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:30.030
<v Speaker 2>what about side to side movements or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can also join the site and you're,</v>

3511
02:36:30.031 --> 02:36:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you're cool with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3512
02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Another one I remember to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3513
02:36:33.911 --> 02:36:35.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and violent context sports.</v>

3514
02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to put your neck in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty weird businesses whether you want</v>

3515
02:36:39.251 --> 02:36:44.251
<v Speaker 2>them to or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to kind of endure yourself </v>

3516
02:36:44.251 --> 02:36:44.251
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3517
02:36:44.251 --> 02:36:48.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic positions and what kind of </v>

3518
02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:48.760
<v Speaker 2>repetitions you talking about when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing neck exercises.</v>

3519
02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Pretty High Reps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3520
02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:51.780
<v Speaker 2>well it depends on the speed of movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

3521
02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a slow high tension speed and </v>

3522
02:36:57.450 --> 02:36:59.830
<v Speaker 2>movement to really fatigue the muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just depends how fast you going.</v>

3523
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Real slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually I go by Tom under load,</v>

3524
02:37:02.331 --> 02:37:05.200
<v Speaker 2>so somewhere between a minute to 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

3525
02:37:05.201 --> 02:37:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Time under load is good for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>

3526
02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the set.</v>

3527
02:37:08.730 --> 02:37:13.730
<v Speaker 2>When your 92nd set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've gotten into over </v>

3528
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:17.041
<v Speaker 2>the last year or so is a long negatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>like exploding on the initial movement,</v>

3529
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>the power of the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if I do a chin up,</v>

3530
02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.160
<v Speaker 2>exploding up and at a very slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like four times as long,</v>

3531
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:27.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more than more than that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way down.</v>

3532
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And they do training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3533
02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 2>it can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

3534
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It's been used for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big proponents of that type </v>

3535
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:38.910
<v Speaker 2>of training was the famous Mike Mentzer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only guy I ever squash nigger.</v>

3536
02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:42.650
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about bodybuilding now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>as real interesting because Mike used to</v>

3537
02:37:42.651 --> 02:37:44.820
<v Speaker 2>use these very intense brief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3538
02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:47.660
<v Speaker 2>exercises the year he'd beat Arnold and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3539
02:37:47.661 --> 02:37:49.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Mr Universe show,</v>

3540
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike was only trained about 90 minutes a</v>

3541
02:37:52.641 --> 02:37:57.170
<v Speaker 2>week and Arnold was trading about 26 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a week.</v>

3542
02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:00.050
<v Speaker 2>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the high intensity training.</v>

3543
02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Ninety minutes of non.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3544
02:38:01.551 --> 02:38:03.890
<v Speaker 2>He was very much into a high intensity </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

3545
02:38:03.891 --> 02:38:06.920
<v Speaker 2>like 30 minute workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His discipled Dorian Yates.</v>

3546
02:38:06.921 --> 02:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>That's 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute workouts a week.</v>

3547
02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:10.160
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go check him out.</v>

3548
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:12.140
<v Speaker 2>He has a whole website called heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>

3549
02:38:12.490 --> 02:38:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a real pioneer in the high </v>

3550
02:38:17.490 --> 02:38:17.490
<v Speaker 2>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3551
02:38:17.490 --> 02:38:21.910
<v Speaker 2>he used a lot and negatives for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing experimentation with isometrics </v>

3552
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.170
<v Speaker 2>towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3553
02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.970
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he could do this 90 minutes a week.</v>

3554
02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:27.580
<v Speaker 2>And of course they're all using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

3555
02:38:27.581 --> 02:38:28.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

3556
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

3557
02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's helps.</v>

3558
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that would give him,</v>

3559
02:38:32.091 --> 02:38:37.091
<v Speaker 2>but people can't say it was just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids because arnold was using </v>

3560
02:38:37.091 --> 02:38:37.091
<v Speaker 2>steroids to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3561
02:38:37.091 --> 02:38:39.290
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about Paavo before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

3562
02:38:39.330 --> 02:38:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Pavel Tsatsouline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3563
02:38:42.890 --> 02:38:47.890
<v Speaker 2>and he is a proponent of low reps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things like under five reps,</v>

3564
02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:51.830
<v Speaker 2>five reps are under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3565
02:38:51.831 --> 02:38:56.480
<v Speaker 2>remember his sport is his strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does.</v>

3566
02:38:56.780 --> 02:38:58.580
<v Speaker 2>He's not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a martial artist.</v>

3567
02:38:58.581 --> 02:39:00.530
<v Speaker 2>He's not an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His sport,</v>

3568
02:39:00.531 --> 02:39:05.531
<v Speaker 2>his weight lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your goal is to lift as much weight </v>

3569
02:39:05.531 --> 02:39:09.551
<v Speaker 2>as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his system works extremely well because </v>

3570
02:39:09.551 --> 02:39:10.220
<v Speaker 2>that is the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3571
02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:14.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're an athlete and you want to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength training to better you and your</v>

3572
02:39:14.361 --> 02:39:19.361
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of your time should be </v>

3573
02:39:19.361 --> 02:39:19.361
<v Speaker 2>spent doing your sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3574
02:39:19.361 --> 02:39:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

3575
02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>the amount of weight isn't the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing necessarily because an </v>

3576
02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:28.010
<v Speaker 2>athlete is not a strength specialist.</v>

3577
02:39:28.430 --> 02:39:32.510
<v Speaker 2>So once you can deadlift or press a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of weight,</v>

3578
02:39:32.930 --> 02:39:35.660
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns.</v>

3579
02:39:35.810 --> 02:39:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how strong do you need to be?</v>

3580
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3581
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:40.130
<v Speaker 2>in a weight class sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3582
02:39:40.131 --> 02:39:45.131
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're able to do a double body </v>

3583
02:39:45.131 --> 02:39:45.131
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deadlift,</v>

3584
02:39:45.131 --> 02:39:45.620
<v Speaker 2>how much stronger you need to bear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to get stronger,</v>

3585
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to specialize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's going to take me away from </v>

3586
02:39:51.010 --> 02:39:52.550
<v Speaker 2>the skills in my sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also a lot of the,</v>

3587
02:39:52.551 --> 02:39:53.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low repetition stuff.</v>

3588
02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:55.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they come from the field of,</v>

3589
02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:57.020
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weightlifting.</v>

3590
02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.360
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strong dude,</v>

3591
02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessary for me to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>low of repetition when I'm just training</v>

3592
02:40:03.651 --> 02:40:05.200
<v Speaker 2>for general strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3593
02:40:05.201 --> 02:40:10.201
<v Speaker 2>his philosophy or his claims are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because what his claims are </v>

3594
02:40:10.201 --> 02:40:13.660
<v Speaker 2>was that people doing these low rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3595
02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:19.820
<v Speaker 3>exercises like five reps are under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they experienced benefits and all of </v>

3596
02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:23.451
<v Speaker 3>their sports and then it translated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that power and strength translated </v>

3597
02:40:23.851 --> 02:40:25.100
<v Speaker 3>to gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3598
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all extra strength training is going to </v>

3599
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:32.451
<v Speaker 2>translate into sports to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic lifting works power lifting </v>

3600
02:40:32.451 --> 02:40:32.480
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3601
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>low reps work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high reps work.</v>

3602
02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I know many guys that did nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>super high repetitions,</v>

3603
02:40:38.491 --> 02:40:40.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been plenty of guys like that.</v>

3604
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:46.070
<v Speaker 2>It all works one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want though is to get as </v>

3605
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:50.211
<v Speaker 2>efficient as possible and you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be beat up for days after your </v>

3606
02:40:50.211 --> 02:40:50.211
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

3607
02:40:50.250 --> 02:40:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the reasons why he liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little rep stuff,</v>

3608
02:40:52.501 --> 02:40:53.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

3609
02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:56.040
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to beat you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat you up quite as much,</v>

3610
02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:58.140
<v Speaker 2>but I found that doing short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brief,</v>

3611
02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:01.680
<v Speaker 2>intense workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually even single sets translated just</v>

3612
02:41:01.681 --> 02:41:05.500
<v Speaker 2>as well as is his anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example of.</v>

3613
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 2>You've heard of a 1973 Miami dolphins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3614
02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:12.790
<v Speaker 2>they were the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only there were under Don Shula,</v>

3615
02:41:13.170 --> 02:41:16.680
<v Speaker 2>they're the only team to go undefeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and win the superbowl.</v>

3616
02:41:16.890 --> 02:41:21.000
<v Speaker 2>No other teams done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since ever in the history of the NFL.</v>

3617
02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:25.800
<v Speaker 2>They use cocaine well here in Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know how they're trained.</v>

3618
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They're trained a nautilus machines with</v>
<v Speaker 2>single set trend.</v>

3619
02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3620
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:33.960
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it all works.</v>

3621
02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:37.110
<v Speaker 2>It all works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get in great shape,</v>

3622
02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you do is just what works</v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

3623
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:43.800
<v Speaker 2>what works best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally believe for a lifetime,</v>

3624
02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:45.630
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lifetime of vendors.</v>

3625
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Speaker 2>If you're getting hurt in your strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

3626
02:41:47.941 --> 02:41:52.941
<v Speaker 2>you're doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strength Training should prevent </v>

3627
02:41:52.941 --> 02:41:56.061
<v Speaker 2>injuries not caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something wrong with your </v>

3628
02:41:56.061 --> 02:41:58.710
<v Speaker 2>technique and your form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me being a wrestler and a Jujitsu Guy,</v>

3629
02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford to hurt myself and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course at my age now you get hurt.</v>

3630
02:42:03.150 --> 02:42:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes for ever to get back.</v>

3631
02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:09.870
<v Speaker 2>We know that fast explosive training </v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

3632
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.470
<v Speaker 2>but we also knows as a much higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance of injury.</v>

3633
02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:15.780
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like slow,</v>

3634
02:42:15.810 --> 02:42:20.810
<v Speaker 2>high tension reps really controlled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you discovered that slow negative.</v>

3635
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow,</v>

3636
02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:26.631
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to be having a really positive </v>

3637
02:42:26.631 --> 02:42:26.631
<v Speaker 3>benefit on my training lately</v>

3638
02:42:26.631 --> 02:42:28.080
<v Speaker 2>and I found that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

3639
02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:33.160
<v Speaker 2>doing my exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting supposedly did not make me </v>

3640
02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:36.581
<v Speaker 2>faster on the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to selectively pick the movements </v>

3641
02:42:36.581 --> 02:42:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be fast and explosive bond </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do those federal those and drill the</v>

3642
02:42:40.581 --> 02:42:43.430
<v Speaker 2>crap out of him until it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking machine.</v>

3643
02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:46.960
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've gotten into </v>
<v Speaker 3>also over the last few months,</v>

3644
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:50.710
<v Speaker 3>his grip strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captains of crush.</v>

3645
02:42:50.730 --> 02:42:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 167 pound one that I just smashed</v>

3646
02:42:54.821 --> 02:42:59.821
<v Speaker 3>that fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd do it for three reps and then I </v>

3647
02:42:59.821 --> 02:43:02.131
<v Speaker 3>throw it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well thanks for taking it easy in my </v>

3648
02:43:02.131 --> 02:43:02.131
<v Speaker 3>hammock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shook hands that well.</v>

3649
02:43:02.131 --> 02:43:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I started with 120 pound one and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3650
02:43:04.861 --> 02:43:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I got 167 pounds one that I use now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a 200 and something pound one</v>

3651
02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:12.150
<v Speaker 3>that I'm saving for when I get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 67 pound</v>

3652
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:13.410
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a,</v>

3653
02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:16.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a rabbit hole with that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3654
02:43:16.310 --> 02:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a maintenance squeeze and </v>

3655
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3656
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3657
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:22.800
<v Speaker 1>just make sure it's not people's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3658
02:43:22.850 --> 02:43:27.850
<v Speaker 1>well I just have gotten excited about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of strengthening my hands </v>

3659
02:43:27.850 --> 02:43:30.610
<v Speaker 1>because my strength hanning has all been</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidental for my hands.</v>

3660
02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.640
<v Speaker 1>It's all been just attached to dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifts and Kettlebells and Chin ups and </v>

3661
02:43:35.651 --> 02:43:37.360
<v Speaker 1>all the different stuff and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands got strong.</v>

3662
02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:39.880
<v Speaker 1>But I've never just actively trained my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grip.</v>

3663
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So when doing this I've been doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll say like four or five months </v>

3664
02:43:45.330 --> 02:43:48.631
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been just smashing these </v>

3665
02:43:48.631 --> 02:43:48.631
<v Speaker 1>things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3666
02:43:48.631 --> 02:43:52.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there's different types of grip </v>

3667
02:43:52.111 --> 02:43:52.111
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3668
02:43:52.111 --> 02:43:52.600
<v Speaker 1>there's that crushing strength which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>captains of crush we give you,</v>

3669
02:43:52.930 --> 02:43:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but there's also like endurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

3670
02:43:54.911 --> 02:43:56.740
<v Speaker 1>which is really good bars for grappling.</v>

3671
02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Well just hanging off a high bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3672
02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:04.260
<v Speaker 1>either 100 or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the things we found </v>

3673
02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:04.260
<v Speaker 1>on fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was interesting.</v>

3674
02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:07.741
<v Speaker 1>We did this thing where we had people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang all over water on a bar just </v>

3675
02:44:07.741 --> 02:44:09.730
<v Speaker 1>hanging by their body weight and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women all beat them in.</v>

3676
02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:14.140
<v Speaker 1>We have strong men really like big yoked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up guys,</v>

3677
02:44:14.141 --> 02:44:17.200
<v Speaker 1>but they were too heavy and the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight ratio,</v>

3678
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and they probably just did curls like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of bitches.</v>

3679
02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grip is really a lot of it.</v>

3680
02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 1>People just don't pay enough attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

3681
02:44:26.930 --> 02:44:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason why rope climbing has stood </v>

3682
02:44:31.930 --> 02:44:34.021
<v Speaker 1>the test of time as a grappling modality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a very specific vertical type </v>

3683
02:44:34.021 --> 02:44:36.970
<v Speaker 1>grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like grab a hand or a neck or a wrist or</v>

3684
02:44:36.971 --> 02:44:40.450
<v Speaker 1>forearm or even an ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A really good for grapplers and man,</v>

3685
02:44:40.451 --> 02:44:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it takes tremendous grip to climb a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>

3686
02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Is a lot of stress on your joints?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3687
02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:45.380
<v Speaker 1>there can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3688
02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to know how to climb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3689
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it has been an extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't been around forever.</v>

3690
02:44:50.470 --> 02:44:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a big fat rope in my garage.</v>

3691
02:44:52.390 --> 02:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the gym that I have set up </v>

3692
02:44:57.390 --> 02:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>in my garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this rope that like,</v>

3693
02:44:57.390 --> 02:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't even get my hand all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

3694
02:44:57.390 --> 02:45:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those ropes that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>tether off a,</v>

3695
02:45:00.270 --> 02:45:01.780
<v Speaker 1>an ocean liner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're for.</v>

3696
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3697
02:45:02.371 --> 02:45:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that's where they get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you,</v>

3698
02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:06.330
<v Speaker 1>just hanging on that are squeezing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3699
02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:09.940
<v Speaker 1>just not even climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hang it until your hand get that is</v>

3700
02:45:09.941 --> 02:45:11.380
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous grip exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3701
02:45:11.381 --> 02:45:12.610
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3702
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:14.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jujitsu wrestling,</v>

3703
02:45:14.231 --> 02:45:19.231
<v Speaker 1>I found the captains of crush don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate as well as doing things like </v>

3704
02:45:19.231 --> 02:45:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Tao Chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3705
02:45:19.631 --> 02:45:23.080
<v Speaker 1>obviously a climbing a rope.</v>

3706
02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:27.390
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys throw a gooey over a chin </v>
<v Speaker 1>up bar and just pull up with tactics,</v>

3707
02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:32.800
<v Speaker 1>specific grip strength and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also just hanging for time like we've </v>

3708
02:45:33.451 --> 02:45:35.980
<v Speaker 1>talked about for shoulder health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome grip exercise.</v>

3709
02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And there's a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between a biological age and</v>

3710
02:45:41.051 --> 02:45:42.570
<v Speaker 1>chronological age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3711
02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:44.980
<v Speaker 1>old people have really weak hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3712
02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like 20 smash it.</v>

3713
02:45:49.270 --> 02:45:51.470
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3714
02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3715
02:45:53.290 --> 02:45:58.290
<v Speaker 1>does the scapular exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an archer and he hangs the way </v>

3716
02:45:59.201 --> 02:46:04.201
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he gets to the hang </v>

3717
02:46:04.201 --> 02:46:05.970
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just lifts himself fantastic exercise</v>

3718
02:46:06.010 --> 02:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>and holds it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like pinching his shoulder blades </v>

3719
02:46:11.010 --> 02:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

3720
02:46:11.010 --> 02:46:13.940
<v Speaker 2>just pulling his body up slightly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his arms completely locked out.</v>

3721
02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Those muscles have so collected and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for posture to.</v>

3722
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

3723
02:46:19.431 --> 02:46:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to superset that with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular pull up sometimes.</v>

3724
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that upper back?</v>

3725
02:46:24.361 --> 02:46:25.730
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually when you do pull ups,</v>

3726
02:46:25.731 --> 02:46:30.090
<v Speaker 2>your arms get tired first by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by present,</v>

3727
02:46:30.170 --> 02:46:31.890
<v Speaker 2>preexisting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lats,</v>

3728
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Rhomboids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know your tears.</v>

3729
02:46:34.430 --> 02:46:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You know those back muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3730
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:39.500
<v Speaker 2>when you do your pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whew man.</v>

3731
02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:43.340
<v Speaker 2>You really feel your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do pull ups.</v>

3732
02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I got all your sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3733
02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:48.320
<v Speaker 2>not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would just the scapula retractions</v>

3734
02:46:48.321 --> 02:46:49.460
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped down,</v>

3735
02:46:49.461 --> 02:46:52.610
<v Speaker 2>shake out my grip a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then jump up and do the pull ups.</v>

3736
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a great little back workout that.</v>

3737
02:46:55.690 --> 02:46:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you do this capital exercises first.</v>

3738
02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Pretty exhausted has those muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're bigger and stronger than</v>

3739
02:47:01.671 --> 02:47:03.500
<v Speaker 2>your little teeny grip forearm.</v>

3740
02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:07.130
<v Speaker 2>And so usually what gives out first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull ups is the hands,</v>

3741
02:47:07.131 --> 02:47:08.720
<v Speaker 2>the forearm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes your biceps.</v>

3742
02:47:09.290 --> 02:47:12.590
<v Speaker 2>So by pre fatiguing those upper back </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles first,</v>

3743
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:16.850
<v Speaker 2>they get much better workout when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>add in the arms.</v>

3744
02:47:16.970 --> 02:47:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

3745
02:47:18.081 --> 02:47:20.000
<v Speaker 2>It's temporarily fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

3746
02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:25.180
<v Speaker 2>So when you do these sets of when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do like those scapular </v>

3747
02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:26.090
<v Speaker 2>contractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call those?</v>

3748
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I always call them scapular retraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>retraction,</v>

3749
02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:30.590
<v Speaker 2>retraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3750
02:47:30.591 --> 02:47:32.480
<v Speaker 2>how long would you hold that position </v>
<v Speaker 2>for?</v>

3751
02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I usually like two seconds up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two seconds down.</v>

3752
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short,</v>

3753
02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:40.310
<v Speaker 2>short little movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 15 second to when you could.</v>

3754
02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I've actually done static contraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I just pulled myself up and held </v>

3755
02:47:45.850 --> 02:47:45.850
<v Speaker 2>it so I couldn't hold it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3756
02:47:45.850 --> 02:47:46.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3757
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:48.020
<v Speaker 2>like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 seconds,</v>

3758
02:47:48.021 --> 02:47:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just depends.</v>

3759
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:51.590
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing that pavel was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about with planks.</v>

3760
02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about like doing a plank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but contracting every muscle in your </v>

3761
02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.890
<v Speaker 2>body and holding that position.</v>

3762
02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:59.990
<v Speaker 2>It's an isometric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's called a,</v>

3763
02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:01.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming isometric.</v>

3764
02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.190
<v Speaker 2>There's two types of evaluation metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is a,</v>

3765
02:48:05.250 --> 02:48:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Yoni isometric,</v>

3766
02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:09.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is where you have a measurable way.</v>

3767
02:48:09.290 --> 02:48:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It could be your body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you hold a chin up at the top </v>

3768
02:48:14.290 --> 02:48:16.991
<v Speaker 2>with your Chin over the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic exercise called the </v>

3769
02:48:16.991 --> 02:48:16.991
<v Speaker 2>flexed arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang.</v>

3770
02:48:16.991 --> 02:48:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a measurable wait there,</v>

3771
02:48:17.661 --> 02:48:22.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other version of that would be you </v>

3772
02:48:22.661 --> 02:48:23.270
<v Speaker 2>just grabbed something and just pull as </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard as he can.</v>

3773
02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:25.550
<v Speaker 2>No way to measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both ways.</v>

3774
02:48:25.551 --> 02:48:28.460
<v Speaker 2>We'll get your strongest as can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong as a beast,</v>

3775
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:32.290
<v Speaker 2>so that plank that you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3776
02:48:32.291 --> 02:48:37.291
<v Speaker 2>it's like a yielding isometric and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a measurable weight which is </v>

3777
02:48:37.291 --> 02:48:40.631
<v Speaker 2>your body weight and rather than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hang out to see how long you can </v>

3778
02:48:40.631 --> 02:48:44.471
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you start to let the </v>

3779
02:48:44.471 --> 02:48:45.500
<v Speaker 2>bank collapse a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start to relax certain areas of your</v>

3780
02:48:45.501 --> 02:48:49.490
<v Speaker 2>body and now it's just not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective,</v>

3781
02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.170
<v Speaker 2>but if you're really trying to shorten </v>
<v Speaker 2>the abdominals and it really squeezing,</v>

3782
02:48:54.171 --> 02:48:57.020
<v Speaker 2>you create this tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you create a tremendous amount of muscle</v>

3783
02:48:57.021 --> 02:49:02.021
<v Speaker 2>fatigue in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be the true purpose of </v>

3784
02:49:02.021 --> 02:49:02.021
<v Speaker 2>exercise to create that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that overload,</v>

3785
02:49:02.021 --> 02:49:04.310
<v Speaker 2>that muscle fatigue and allowing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles to recover from that.</v>

3786
02:49:04.311 --> 02:49:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And then it's the base of strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3787
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3788
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend and a lot of Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys getting into this now where they're</v>

3789
02:49:11.581 --> 02:49:14.190
<v Speaker 1>doing super slow sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love super slow,</v>

3790
02:49:14.191 --> 02:49:18.390
<v Speaker 1>says I was one of the original super </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow trainers back in the day.</v>

3791
02:49:18.690 --> 02:49:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I still do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a man ages,</v>

3792
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and you have all the dings in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and elbows and stuff,</v>

3793
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that you'll be drawn more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more to nice,</v>

3794
02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:27.690
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high tension sets,</v>

3795
02:49:27.930 --> 02:49:29.370
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very safe way to train.</v>

3796
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many seconds up and down do you </v>

3797
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.910
<v Speaker 1>suggest like save for something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chin up?</v>

3798
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Mentzer for bodyboarding </v>

3799
02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:41.901
<v Speaker 1>hypertrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found like a four to four where you </v>

3800
02:49:41.901 --> 02:49:44.821
<v Speaker 1>would like four seconds up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pausing the contract position and four </v>

3801
02:49:44.821 --> 02:49:46.110
<v Speaker 1>seconds down the contract position to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push up.</v>

3802
02:49:46.111 --> 02:49:48.420
<v Speaker 1>The hard part would be the bottom part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3803
02:49:48.421 --> 02:49:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just off the floor on a chin up,</v>

3804
02:49:51.031 --> 02:49:51.990
<v Speaker 1>it would be the top part.</v>

3805
02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So for a pushup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you would,</v>

3806
02:49:54.421 --> 02:49:57.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would slowly go up for like one,</v>

3807
02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:58.950
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3808
02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:03.300
<v Speaker 1>four turnaround.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you would then turn out or just have</v>

3809
02:50:03.301 --> 02:50:05.390
<v Speaker 1>a good back down and hold it the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

3810
02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:06.630
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3811
02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:07.680
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3812
02:50:07.681 --> 02:50:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and then how long would you hold it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand bond.</v>

3813
02:50:10.171 --> 02:50:12.720
<v Speaker 1>One thousand two and then two seconds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then backup one,</v>

3814
02:50:12.930 --> 02:50:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's surprisingly difficult to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone who thinks of a pushup as </v>

3815
02:50:17.930 --> 02:50:18.930
<v Speaker 1>being a pretty mild exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3816
02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you can just sand blast yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about five or six reps if you do it</v>

3817
02:50:22.891 --> 02:50:23.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3818
02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I've even done them slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone like,</v>

3819
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

3820
02:50:27.301 --> 02:50:28.500
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

3821
02:50:28.501 --> 02:50:32.160
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried doing a try this if you'd like.</v>

3822
02:50:32.161 --> 02:50:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Negative accentuated sometime you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hotel room.</v>

3823
02:50:34.531 --> 02:50:39.531
<v Speaker 1>You want to get a quick pump for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy act to start at the top pump for </v>

3824
02:50:39.531 --> 02:50:39.531
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

3825
02:50:39.531 --> 02:50:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I stretch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a dude.</v>

3826
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:48.190
<v Speaker 1>You got the rep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a private fit is con comic out </v>

3827
02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:52.581
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you find that comics in general </v>

3828
02:50:52.581 --> 02:50:53.190
<v Speaker 1>are pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of alcoholics and smoking.</v>

3829
02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:54.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of small can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3830
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:56.990
<v Speaker 1>The nature of the nightclub life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3831
02:50:57.270 --> 02:51:00.870
<v Speaker 1>it's very unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also there's this false correlation</v>

3832
02:51:00.871 --> 02:51:03.090
<v Speaker 1>that you have to be an abuser of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to be funny.</v>

3833
02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3834
02:51:04.361 --> 02:51:09.361
<v Speaker 1>I know that a vanity and I'm taking care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body are connected and that </v>

3835
02:51:10.201 --> 02:51:13.830
<v Speaker 1>vanity is ego and then having a big ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being vain,</v>

3836
02:51:13.890 --> 02:51:16.770
<v Speaker 1>like it's anti comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think,</v>

3837
02:51:17.010 --> 02:51:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's vanity to take care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body.</v>

3838
02:51:19.201 --> 02:51:24.201
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's foolishness to not take </v>

3839
02:51:24.201 --> 02:51:24.201
<v Speaker 1>care of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3840
02:51:24.201 --> 02:51:28.401
<v Speaker 1>I just know too many people's bodies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally falling apart and who are my </v>

3841
02:51:28.401 --> 02:51:31.920
<v Speaker 1>age or younger who have massive issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it myself,</v>

3842
02:51:31.921 --> 02:51:32.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3843
02:51:32.190 --> 02:51:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3844
02:51:34.231 --> 02:51:39.231
<v Speaker 1>and they realize with time the error of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way and it's usually too late if </v>

3845
02:51:39.231 --> 02:51:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you start a rigorous physical fitness </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

3846
02:51:41.371 --> 02:51:46.371
<v Speaker 1>but when you're 45 like boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta kind have an uphill battle </v>

3847
02:51:46.371 --> 02:51:47.190
<v Speaker 1>there and got an uphill battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I didn't pause.</v>

3848
02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Anthony Bordain,</v>

3849
02:51:48.361 --> 02:51:50.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going on with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Jujitsu guy now.</v>

3850
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:57.550
<v Speaker 1>He started at 58 of lifetime of drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and smoking and even a problem with </v>

3851
02:51:57.661 --> 02:51:59.820
<v Speaker 1>heroin in his youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting himself cleaned up.</v>

3852
02:51:59.850 --> 02:52:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard him present to it too.</v>

3853
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's way beyond.</v>

3854
02:52:02.791 --> 02:52:07.791
<v Speaker 1>She's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very good and she's obsessed and </v>

3855
02:52:07.791 --> 02:52:07.791
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

3856
02:52:07.791 --> 02:52:11.040
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why he got into it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place because his wife is a </v>

3857
02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:11.040
<v Speaker 2>maniac and he didn't want to get choked </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3858
02:52:11.230 --> 02:52:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3859
02:52:11.591 --> 02:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean she talked him into it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3860
02:52:13.330 --> 02:52:17.740
<v Speaker 2>she loves it so much and then once she </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually bribed him with narcotics,</v>

3861
02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:23.070
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how she got him in and she told </v>

3862
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:23.070
<v Speaker 2>him she'd given vicodins and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3863
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:25.090
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got him into it and then once he got</v>

3864
02:52:25.091 --> 02:52:26.410
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

3865
02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:28.780
<v Speaker 2>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say this in a good way,</v>

3866
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:31.330
<v Speaker 2>he's very obsessive guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets obsessed with things,</v>

3867
02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:36.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why he's such a great chef and a </v>

3868
02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:36.460
<v Speaker 2>great writer and he's great on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>television show and he got obsessed with</v>

3869
02:52:36.461 --> 02:52:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He travels everywhere.</v>

3870
02:52:37.841 --> 02:52:39.970
<v Speaker 2>He brings his gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trains everyday.</v>

3871
02:52:40.090 --> 02:52:42.880
<v Speaker 2>He trains twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll do a private and then they'll do a</v>

3872
02:52:42.881 --> 02:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>class every day.</v>

3873
02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trained with the Chris Crook.</v>

3874
02:52:46.751 --> 02:52:48.040
<v Speaker 2>The guy was talking about family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3875
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:49.450
<v Speaker 2>my web guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3876
02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:52.570
<v Speaker 2>he trained with Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it was really fun.</v>

3877
02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:54.180
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3878
02:52:54.190 --> 02:52:57.850
<v Speaker 2>back to that pushup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So try starting at the top right?</v>

3879
02:52:57.940 --> 02:53:00.760
<v Speaker 2>You very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually your iphone,</v>

3880
02:53:00.820 --> 02:53:02.410
<v Speaker 2>like a little timer on there or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3881
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I use one with a metronome so I can hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>the text and I go on down in 30 seconds.</v>

3882
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And when my chest just barely grazed </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>

3883
02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I do a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call turnaround,</v>

3884
02:53:13.810 --> 02:53:17.830
<v Speaker 2>where you change direction very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back up in 30 seconds.</v>

3885
02:53:18.310 --> 02:53:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't walk out of the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no resting at the top because </v>

3886
02:53:23.310 --> 02:53:23.310
<v Speaker 2>the top is just too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3887
02:53:23.310 --> 02:53:26.560
<v Speaker 2>You can hold it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I keep my elbows just a little unbent</v>

3888
02:53:26.820 --> 02:53:30.310
<v Speaker 2>and then 30 seconds back down dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the pump of your life.</v>

3889
02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Ninety seconds time under load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like wow.</v>

3890
02:53:33.761 --> 02:53:37.230
<v Speaker 2>What an amazing workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One fricking rep,</v>

3891
02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Sassy one and a half Rep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

3892
02:53:39.371 --> 02:53:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

3893
02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Just negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Positive.</v>

3894
02:53:41.591 --> 02:53:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Negative for 90 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you set like a timer for them?</v>

3895
02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Not for 90 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this running stopwatch.</v>

3896
02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use like a little thing on my iphone.</v>

3897
02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:51.880
<v Speaker 2>It goes tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

3898
02:53:52.390 --> 02:53:53.570
<v Speaker 2>tick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>

3899
02:53:54.430 --> 02:53:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

3900
02:53:55.781 --> 02:53:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of those many apps,</v>

3901
02:53:58.001 --> 02:54:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted one that had an audible </v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

3902
02:54:00.071 --> 02:54:05.071
<v Speaker 2>so if I can't actually see the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I can listen to the the </v>

3903
02:54:05.071 --> 02:54:08.740
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's real easy to fool yourself when </v>

3904
02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:08.740
<v Speaker 2>going too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3905
02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:12.481
<v Speaker 2>Do you do the same sort of technique for</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats or for any other exercises?</v>

3906
02:54:12.851 --> 02:54:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I have this one body weight squat where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you faced the law where you can't unload</v>

3907
02:54:17.411 --> 02:54:18.400
<v Speaker 2>by meaning forward.</v>

3908
02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You know that your torso leaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

3909
02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Who Man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a killer.</v>

3910
02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You face the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I faced the wall.</v>

3911
02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Great figure posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3912
02:54:25.031 --> 02:54:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Your toes against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing?</v>

3913
02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you're facing the wall and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>close are you to wall?</v>

3914
02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:35.220
<v Speaker 2>My toes knows everything's touching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees and my hands are out to the side </v>

3915
02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>as slowly lower down and you keep your </v>
<v Speaker 2>face on the wall so you know,</v>

3916
02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.000
<v Speaker 2>barely skimming and it's great for </v>
<v Speaker 2>posture because your back is really </v>

3917
02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.221
<v Speaker 2>arched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're working isometrically and I </v>

3918
02:54:47.221 --> 02:54:50.371
<v Speaker 2>don't do the top third of the movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a body weight squat because it's </v>

3919
02:54:50.371 --> 02:54:53.611
<v Speaker 2>just too damn easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recover so mechanically </v>

3920
02:54:53.611 --> 02:54:55.090
<v Speaker 2>efficient at the top that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

3921
02:54:55.270 --> 02:54:57.880
<v Speaker 2>so you get to the top third and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back down again.</v>

3922
02:54:57.881 --> 02:54:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they use that 30,</v>

3923
02:54:59.450 --> 02:55:00.550
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 for that one.</v>

3924
02:55:01.050 --> 02:55:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It's absolute killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're done,</v>

3925
02:55:02.381 --> 02:55:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you just basically your legs are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>crippled for a second or two.</v>

3926
02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing slow Hindu pushups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just amazed at how tired you can get</v>

3927
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 2>a set of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow Hindu pushups in your heart is </v>

3928
02:55:17.410 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 2>ready to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

3929
02:55:17.410 --> 02:55:22.121
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to go fast to get a </v>

3930
02:55:22.121 --> 02:55:22.470
<v Speaker 2>good cardio metabolic workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that Hindu pushup too,</v>

3931
02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:27.490
<v Speaker 2>just for the range of motion and such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wide range of motion in that spinal </v>

3932
02:55:27.831 --> 02:55:28.870
<v Speaker 2>mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3933
02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I would say arguably that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only pushup a person would need just for</v>

3934
02:55:35.361 --> 02:55:36.710
<v Speaker 2>fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3935
02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean really it's a hell of a exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically upward and downward dog </v>

3936
02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:43.280
<v Speaker 2>of yoga combined with the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3937
02:55:43.281 --> 02:55:45.440
<v Speaker 2>and I do it with a 40 pound weight vest </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

3938
02:55:45.470 --> 02:55:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Third Year a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3939
02:55:46.641 --> 02:55:48.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just such a great workout.</v>

3940
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Just signed it down even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try do in 10 seconds so you don't have </v>

3941
02:55:53.170 --> 02:55:55.430
<v Speaker 2>to keep adding more weight to your vest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3942
02:55:55.810 --> 02:55:57.980
<v Speaker 2>well as I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Angelo is really important.</v>

3943
02:55:58.310 --> 02:56:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the gym one time.</v>

3944
02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I saw this guy just jacking off pull ups</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy.</v>

3945
02:56:03.891 --> 02:56:06.740
<v Speaker 2>He was using a lot of momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was basically one second.</v>

3946
02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:07.620
<v Speaker 2>One second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3947
02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:10.250
<v Speaker 2>The dude did 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is impressive,</v>

3948
02:56:10.810 --> 02:56:15.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was pretty much yanking up as </v>

3949
02:56:15.810 --> 02:56:15.810
<v Speaker 2>joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3950
02:56:15.810 --> 02:56:16.460
<v Speaker 2>so I had my client client do a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

3951
02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:21.410
<v Speaker 2>but he was doing for two for each one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy that did the 25,</v>

3952
02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.250
<v Speaker 2>his time under load is only 50 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guy did six.</v>

3953
02:56:25.370 --> 02:56:29.270
<v Speaker 2>His time under load was a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Guy Actually did more mechanical work</v>

3954
02:56:29.271 --> 02:56:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and was physically in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>

3955
02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Better strength to weight ratio.</v>

3956
02:56:33.530 --> 02:56:36.050
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossfit style?</v>

3957
02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Put Chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely insane.</v>

3958
02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we talked about this last time.</v>

3959
02:56:41.721 --> 02:56:45.610
<v Speaker 2>That guy keeping that Greg glassman guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys in a beast.</v>

3960
02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Crippled man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3961
02:56:47.031 --> 02:56:49.430
<v Speaker 2>he's got health issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a man.</v>

3962
02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I know that he kind of started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man is like,</v>

3963
02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:53.480
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have.</v>

3964
02:56:53.481 --> 02:56:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I could have had health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually the injuries that I've had,</v>

3965
02:56:58.340 --> 02:57:00.080
<v Speaker 2>if anyone has an excuse for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

3966
02:57:00.330 --> 02:57:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to toot my own horn,</v>

3967
02:57:02.001 --> 02:57:07.001
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never missed a training due to an </v>

3968
02:57:07.001 --> 02:57:07.001
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

3969
02:57:07.001 --> 02:57:07.490
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hurt your shoulder,</v>

3970
02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you got your other shoulder and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs that you can work into your core </v>

3971

<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3973
02:57:14.511 --> 02:57:16.550

<v Speaker 2>You always work around it.</v>

3974
02:57:16.610 --> 02:57:17.450
<v Speaker 2>There's something to do.</v>

3975
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Always something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Training,</v>

3976
02:57:19.731 --> 02:57:24.731
<v Speaker 2>just because you're injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull out L for my spine one time just </v>

3977
02:57:24.731 --> 02:57:27.260
<v Speaker 2>doing the stupid abdominal roll outs </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the feet.</v>

3978
02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:29.210
<v Speaker 2>What's an abdominal roy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3979

3982
02:57:39.941 --> 02:57:39.941
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty good at that.</v>

3983
02:57:39.941 --> 02:57:44.600
<v Speaker 2>One time from your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You roll the whole way out in the </v>

3984
02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.161
<v Speaker 2>hallway back,</v>

3992
02:58:05.131 --> 02:58:06.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just too afraid to do it.</v>

3993

<v Speaker 2>Is that hard to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but you got to really,</v>

3997
02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:20.451
<v Speaker 2>really braced your abdominals and keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>recruits tight because the shearing </v>

3998
02:58:20.451 --> 02:58:23.070
<v Speaker 2>force on the lumbar is really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I found out,</v>

3999
02:58:23.250 --> 02:58:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't do those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do do a lot of ab wheel stuff,</v>

4000
02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:28.830
<v Speaker 2>but I just never do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it off your knees.</v>

4001
02:58:29.540 --> 02:58:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the same movement is hanging leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>raises.</v>

4002
02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Very safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people call it toes to bar.</v>

4003
02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Try doing it with no momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slow up.</v>

4004
02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Touch your tippy toes to bar pause for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

4005
02:58:40.440 --> 02:58:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Slowly lower if you do three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4006
02:58:43.441 --> 02:58:48.441
<v Speaker 2>You're pretty strong core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same level that with Lake </v>

4007
02:58:48.441 --> 02:58:48.441
<v Speaker 2>Street?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4008
02:58:48.441 --> 02:58:53.331
<v Speaker 2>with extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like try to almost like you're touching </v>

4009
02:58:53.331 --> 02:58:53.331
<v Speaker 2>your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toes to bar,</v>

4010
02:58:53.331 --> 02:58:53.970
<v Speaker 2>ankles or shins.</v>

4011
02:58:53.970 --> 02:58:56.740
<v Speaker 2>That means that person's too tight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hamstrings.</v>

4012
02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:58.290
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4013
02:58:58.291 --> 02:59:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I blew my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an l for a subluxation.</v>

4014
02:59:02.220 --> 02:59:06.300
<v Speaker 2>And your thesis and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was told I might need surgery.</v>

4015
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:09.330
<v Speaker 2>So the bulging disc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

4016
02:59:09.331 --> 02:59:14.331
<v Speaker 2>I had Sciatica so bad y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even walk when you were </v>

4017
02:59:14.331 --> 02:59:14.690
<v Speaker 2>hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did I have the reverse hyper machine.</v>

4018
02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:16.020
<v Speaker 2>The bank when you were here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4019
02:59:16.021 --> 02:59:16.920
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4020
02:59:16.921 --> 02:59:18.750
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you used those at all?</v>

4021
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the strength curve I think I told </v>

4022
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:26.241
<v Speaker 2>you is off because right where your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your glutes and your lower back or in </v>

4023
02:59:26.241 --> 02:59:29.190
<v Speaker 2>the weakest part of the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resistance is at its highest.</v>

4024
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

4025
02:59:30.721 --> 02:59:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4026
02:59:31.291 --> 02:59:36.291
<v Speaker 2>you'd almost be better off putting ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights on and just doing a reverse leg </v>

4027
02:59:36.291 --> 02:59:36.291
<v Speaker 2>raises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

4028
02:59:36.291 --> 02:59:40.491
<v Speaker 2>I just love it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a decompression of the spine and </v>

4029
02:59:40.491 --> 02:59:40.920
<v Speaker 2>strengthening the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower back area.</v>

4030
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean that my whole back area is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so thick and strong from doing that.</v>

4031
02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:46.890
<v Speaker 2>That exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a lot of relief.</v>

4032
02:59:47.150 --> 02:59:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that machine.</v>

4033
02:59:48.960 --> 02:59:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4034
02:59:49.681 --> 02:59:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against it per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4035
02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I think there is this as good if not </v>
<v Speaker 2>better exercises that you can use </v>

4036
02:59:56.180 --> 02:59:56.180
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4037
02:59:56.180 --> 02:59:56.940
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4038
02:59:57.350 --> 02:59:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't travel with a reverse hyper.</v>

4039
02:59:59.630 --> 03:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a hard time checking that </v>

4040
03:00:04.630 --> 03:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what I do enjoy is the,</v>

4041
03:00:04.630 --> 03:00:05.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 45 degree,</v>

4042
03:00:06.020 --> 03:00:09.510
<v Speaker 2>a back extension bench where you do back</v>
<v Speaker 2>extensions.</v>

4043
03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic exercise is that called Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>chairs?</v>

4044
03:00:12.571 --> 03:00:16.290
<v Speaker 2>That was quite a Roman share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of along those lines.</v>

4045
03:00:16.291 --> 03:00:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about the glute ham </v>
<v Speaker 2>raises.</v>

4046
03:00:18.270 --> 03:00:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually talking about 45 degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>extension.</v>

4047
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4048
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I was at Arthur Jones ranch when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing his experiments with Fedex,</v>

4049
03:00:26.671 --> 03:00:27.440
<v Speaker 2>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4050
03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:30.060
<v Speaker 2>a machine for back rehabilitation.</v>

4051
03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:34.740
<v Speaker 2>And the medic studies is doing it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Dr Wayne Pollack From University of</v>

4052
03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Florida medical school and they found </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people's backs are pretty </v>

4053
03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:39.960
<v Speaker 2>undeveloped and pretty weak and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause a lot of problems.</v>

4054
03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:44.010
<v Speaker 2>So they were trying to invent a machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work that area,</v>

4055
03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but the freaking machines were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>$50,000.</v>

4056
03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4057
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you're getting all of these electrical </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed out and all this stuff.</v>

4058
03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:52.780
<v Speaker 2>So I said to Arthur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4059
03:00:52.781 --> 03:00:57.781
<v Speaker 2>surely there must be a very simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise that you could do that would </v>

4060
03:00:57.781 --> 03:00:58.980
<v Speaker 2>give you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good results.</v>

4061
03:00:58.990 --> 03:01:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Because he was basically poopooing most </v>
<v Speaker 2>back exercises is not really working the</v>

4062
03:01:03.521 --> 03:01:08.521
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them work the glutes and the </v>

4063
03:01:08.521 --> 03:01:10.741
<v Speaker 2>hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kettlebell swings or deadlift more </v>

4064
03:01:10.741 --> 03:01:11.140
<v Speaker 2>gluten hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said the back extension,</v>

4065
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.640
<v Speaker 2>he says that would come as close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started religiously practicing </v>

4066
03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>back extension and man attire.</v>

4067
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>That's one area of my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was always strong right up until </v>

4068
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that point where I did those abdominal </v>
<v Speaker 2>rollouts.</v>

4069
03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:25.770
<v Speaker 2>That was the first package driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4070
03:01:26.530 --> 03:01:28.390
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get over that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4071
03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a raw for.</v>

4072
03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I had this woman that was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor at the Rolf Institute,</v>

4073
03:01:34.210 --> 03:01:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4074
03:01:34.650 --> 03:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do circuits really good hands on </v>

4075
03:01:39.650 --> 03:01:43.111
<v Speaker 2>rover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the one that I heard the word </v>

4076
03:01:43.111 --> 03:01:43.111
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>C'Mon Bruh.</v>

4077
03:01:43.111 --> 03:01:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was pretty much anti surgery</v>

4078
03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:46.270
<v Speaker 2>as a first time I ever heard someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

4079
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:48.550
<v Speaker 2>oh Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really did it this time.</v>

4080
03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether I can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

4081
03:01:50.830 --> 03:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You really messed your backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try,</v>

4082
03:01:53.891 --> 03:01:58.891
<v Speaker 2>but I can't guarantee anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she would put me on their table like </v>

4083
03:01:58.891 --> 03:02:03.780
<v Speaker 2>in a tense position where the table goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this with my bent or listening </v>

4084
03:02:05.831 --> 03:02:07.870
<v Speaker 2>readily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking your fingers and trying to rotate</v>

4085
03:02:07.871 --> 03:02:09.550
<v Speaker 2>the vertebrae back into position.</v>

4086
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I was going to this guy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

4087
03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to take painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Dr.</v>

4088
03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Frank Goo and Philadelphia and art </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight a.</v>

4089
03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:22.390
<v Speaker 2>He was shooting me with the needles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acupuncture,</v>

4090
03:02:22.450 --> 03:02:27.250
<v Speaker 2>acupuncture for pain relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would walk in absolute agony and I</v>

4091
03:02:27.251 --> 03:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>would walk out probably 60 to 70 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduction in the paint and it would last</v>

4092
03:02:32.081 --> 03:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>for a day or two and then he'll come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back of course.</v>

4093
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:39.150
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just doing it just to get out of </v>

4094
03:02:39.150 --> 03:02:41.260
<v Speaker 2>pain and over the course of say how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions was it?</v>

4095
03:02:41.530 --> 03:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>It was like eight sessions by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighth,</v>

4096
03:02:44.380 --> 03:02:49.380
<v Speaker 2>eighth session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden I woke up one day and </v>

4097
03:02:49.380 --> 03:02:51.100
<v Speaker 2>the pain was completely so slowly </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing in the disc was going back in,</v>

4098
03:02:51.130 --> 03:02:56.050
<v Speaker 2>finally squirted back in the stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything like I was in a back chair,</v>

4099
03:02:56.590 --> 03:03:01.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be the trainer for the owners </v>

4100
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.590
<v Speaker 2>of the Philadelphia Eagles.</v>

4101
03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>The Jeff occurred scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're divorced now,</v>

4102
03:03:04.151 --> 03:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but jeff's still owns the Philadelphia </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

4103
03:03:06.940 --> 03:03:11.940
<v Speaker 2>He used to have all these really cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>nifty devices because he suffered a lot </v>

4104
03:03:11.940 --> 03:03:13.250
<v Speaker 2>from back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a chair that you sit on a sling,</v>

4105
03:03:13.610 --> 03:03:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like this playground swings with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>two clamps and grab you underneath your </v>

4106
03:03:18.610 --> 03:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>armpits and clamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4107
03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So your clamped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can adjust it and then you slowly </v>

4108
03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:27.810
<v Speaker 2>release the slang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just basically sitting with </v>

4109
03:03:27.810 --> 03:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>your back completely just hanging there </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your armpits.</v>

4110
03:03:30.010 --> 03:03:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would sit there and watch tv for </v>

4111
03:03:35.010 --> 03:03:35.010
<v Speaker 2>an hour or so with my back in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>traction.</v>

4112
03:03:35.770 --> 03:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That really gave me a lot of relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4113
03:03:37.691 --> 03:03:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Despite the decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4114
03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:41.290
<v Speaker 2>The back chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really expensive thing.</v>

4115
03:03:41.291 --> 03:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I just borrowed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I borrowed his for like a couple months.</v>

4116
03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing really helped.</v>

4117
03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about those?</v>

4118
03:03:46.590 --> 03:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Like where those hangups were you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>those?</v>

4119
03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>I do a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the table where the room </v>

4120
03:03:55.260 --> 03:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>for it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I do like it.</v>

4121
03:03:55.260 --> 03:03:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I did have an inversion boots that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to hang off,</v>

4122
03:03:57.050 --> 03:04:00.320
<v Speaker 2>pull up on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My problem was with the Sciatic.</v>

4123
03:04:00.370 --> 03:04:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get into the position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just too painful.</v>

4124
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4125
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I was in two minds are so far gone so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far gone.</v>

4126
03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Everything was killing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once it went away it was like,</v>

4127
03:04:11.361 --> 03:04:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never happened.</v>

4128
03:04:13.850 --> 03:04:16.520
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite that I didn't stop training.</v>

4129
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I was still doing super slow a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're pulldowns and chest presses and </v>

4130
03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:27.140
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough with that injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riding the Schwinn Airdyne,</v>

4131
03:04:27.141 --> 03:04:32.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those air bikes with the handles that </v>

4132
03:04:32.141 --> 03:04:32.141
<v Speaker 2>did hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually felt good.</v>

4133
03:04:32.141 --> 03:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I would feel good for like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes after that workout with zero </v>

4134
03:04:36.730 --> 03:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>pain and then it would slowly come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>on mega.</v>

4135
03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Those airdyne machine seemed to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a really popular exercise for strength </v>

4136
03:04:43.491 --> 03:04:48.491
<v Speaker 2>and conditioning for fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of wrestlers use them because I'll </v>

4137
03:04:48.491 --> 03:04:48.491
<v Speaker 2>tell you a man's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The faster you go,</v>

4138
03:04:48.491 --> 03:04:49.760
<v Speaker 2>the harder it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The air displacement.</v>

4139
03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:54.940
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's so cool about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting both upper and lower </v>

4140
03:04:54.940 --> 03:04:54.940
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4141
03:04:54.940 --> 03:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just lower body aerobics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body's involved in like a </v>

4142
03:04:59.140 --> 03:05:03.370
<v Speaker 2>strength endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do those bother you with your shoulder </v>

4143
03:05:03.370 --> 03:05:03.530
<v Speaker 2>leave shoulder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any kind of vertical movement?</v>

4144
03:05:03.650 --> 03:05:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean horizontal movement in price,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overhead press that,</v>

4145
03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>but interestingly enough I can still do </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hindu pushups.</v>

4146
03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the angle I can angle it and also,</v>

4147
03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:16.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corkscrewing the hands gripping a,</v>

4148
03:05:16.940 --> 03:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>activating the lattes and all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff can really keep you out of </v>

4149
03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

4150
03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:23.300
<v Speaker 2>we just did three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4151
03:05:23.570 --> 03:05:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Flew by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow Man.</v>

4152
03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I know you have this video though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell people about this video,</v>

4153
03:05:28.521 --> 03:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>your isometric video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just came out with my second isometric</v>

4154
03:05:31.530 --> 03:05:33.020
<v Speaker 2>because I was so thrilled with the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

4155
03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started looking deeper and isometrics </v>

4156
03:05:38.340 --> 03:05:40.781
<v Speaker 2>and I found these old school techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've made an advanced isometric a </v>

4157
03:05:41.450 --> 03:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it a war,</v>

4158
03:05:42.690 --> 03:05:44.450
<v Speaker 2>a full workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go through it.</v>

4159
03:05:44.451 --> 03:05:49.451
<v Speaker 2>What I did was in the first one I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>either yielding or overcoming </v>

4160
03:05:49.451 --> 03:05:50.960
<v Speaker 2>isometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here for vans,</v>

4161
03:05:50.961 --> 03:05:54.480
<v Speaker 2>guys are really strong like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I combine yielding,</v>

4162
03:05:55.260 --> 03:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>yielding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and overcoming isometrics in the same </v>

4163
03:06:00.260 --> 03:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Boy,</v>

4164
03:06:00.260 --> 03:06:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell ya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even an Olympic athlete could,</v>

4165
03:06:01.700 --> 03:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>could get a full workout in a hotel room</v>
<v Speaker 2>with virtually no equipment.</v>

4166
03:06:06.770 --> 03:06:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Just your Jujitsu belt is all you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>really neat.</v>

4167
03:06:09.860 --> 03:06:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would know you had a workout.</v>

4168
03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Very safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no chance of.</v>

4169
03:06:14.540 --> 03:06:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course some Ada could screw it up and</v>

4170
03:06:17.661 --> 03:06:22.661
<v Speaker 2>get himself hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the chance of hurting yourself with </v>

4171
03:06:22.661 --> 03:06:23.510
<v Speaker 2>isometrics is virtually none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good way to also work around an injury.</v>

4172
03:06:23.690 --> 03:06:24.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a foot,</v>

4173
03:06:24.621 --> 03:06:25.760
<v Speaker 2>ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee,</v>

4174
03:06:25.761 --> 03:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could still do isometrics,</v>

4175
03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could even potentially do isometrics</v>

4176
03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4177
03:06:34.041 --> 03:06:39.041
<v Speaker 2>let's say you had an injury in a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident where you could actually keep </v>

4178
03:06:39.041 --> 03:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>your muscles in shape laying in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4179
03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where can people get it?</v>
