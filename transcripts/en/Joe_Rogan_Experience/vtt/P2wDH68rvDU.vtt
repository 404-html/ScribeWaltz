1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.910
I would argue and I agree and I think you end up just losing your mind and see

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.750
what we're going live.

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.720
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Too</v>

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.960
<v 0>much ladies and mother.
Fucking gentle man.
Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.690
What's up boys,
man,
we're live now.

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.470
Other people can hear all the Shit we've been saying.
Right?

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.640
It's hard to make the transition.
What do with live?
Fuck it.
We'll do it.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.610
We'll do it live to go from an yeah,

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.290
that what was that hard copy or something like that.
He was on bill O'Reilly's.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.100
Just freaking out.
It's a blowhard.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.740
It's so amazing that that guy's popular board though,
right?

12
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.070
It's kind of dying down a towel.
Maybe guys like you,

13
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:43.100
but you weren't watching the first place.
If you're an old lady,

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.120
if you post Menopausal Olay below,
right?
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
he's very crowd.

15
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.920
He's really easy.
It's like he creates,
he's like a sharp profile.
Right?
So he,

16
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.330
when he'll,

17
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.600
he'll make the issues really cut and dry and really loud and here the lines,

18
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.530
it goes in,
the tide goes out.
You can explain that.
There you go.
God,

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.990
I'm putting my money on.
God.

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.380
I read two of his books and I read two of Ann Coulter's books to see what they

21
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.070
were saying and it was really interesting because I know why they're popular.

22
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.870
If you,
if you package something in terms of good guys,
bad guys,

23
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.660
or you know,
like he wrote a book called who's looking out for you.

24
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.050
It was kind of an interesting book about,
and he was very real about saying,
look,

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.340
I run in a circle of people that are really wealthy and powerful.
Guess what?

26
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.360
They don't really care about you because that's how human beings are when they

27
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:33.290
have a lot of stuff going on in Donald Trump.
Makes it a little bit,
your boy,

28
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.910
Donald Trump's kind of flying off the hinges.
I think he's just saying,

29
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.910
not my boy.
Well,
yeah,
he is.
He's your best friend.

30
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.520
I think he's just saying it for like x factor.
You know what I'm saying?

31
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.630
Like he's just trying to stand out.
He's wild as fuck.
Yeah,
he's an EGOMANIAC.

32
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:49.070
When my buddy Jimmy Burke met Donald Trump,
he said,
Donald,
huge fan,

33
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:52.400
huge fan of your buildings.
I think your buildings are amazing,
dude.

34
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.380
And I love your tie
with the Donald say,
just kind of looked at him,

35
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.990
killed Teddy Demi at the time who was the director of the late Teddy.

36
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.290
Damien just went,
ah,
okay,
thanks.
He goes,
but look at your tie.

37
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.080
He kept saying your tie.
It's like,
you know,
so when you're building,

38
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.320
the sponsors have dropped them so many after you made those comments about

39
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.890
Mexicans and rape.
Yeah,
he's in home.
He's retarded.
And Anderson,

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.540
Anderson Cooper was like,
you know,
financially,
you know,

41
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.860
how much money have you lost?
He goes,
I don't know.
I'm Brits really don't care.

42
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.020
I just don't care.
Merge Merv Griffin,
Merv Griffin.
I did.
Uh,

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.290
I did a show with him once and Merv Griffin was insanely rich as we know.

44
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.580
And he also wrote like,
he was also an artist.

45
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:34.070
Like he wrote the theme song to jeopardy and Weird Shit.

46
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.070
And you know more if you know Merv Griffin this,
you might be a little young.

47
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.830
I don't know who he is.
I know the theme.
You just thought the name.
And he wrote,

48
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.350
he wrote the theme song to a bunch of different shows.
And when you do that,

49
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.170
it's a slick move that you get paid every time it plays.

50
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.560
And there are a lot of examples of those kinds of things that he did.
He was,

51
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.040
he could play the piano and I'm think,
but he was also a major mogul,

52
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.970
like a tycoon and wealthier than Donald Trump.
Ferociously gay

53
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.320
him.
Yes.
So ferociously gate.
Did a show with,

54
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.230
with his company Trigram your dog?
No.
No.
He was very friendly,
but there was a,

55
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.250
does it look in his eyes?
Like the door's always open.

56
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.150
Harvest.
I spent,
he's just like a guy.
I spent a week with him.

57
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.980
Hold on,
stop.
We're going to take him to his pizza.

58
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.430
You wearing flip flops and he massage your feet.
Honestly,

59
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.350
I spend a lot of time blindfolded.
I can't remember.

60
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.960
I can't remember a lot of that,

61
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.530
but he was like my dad and aunt and uncle at the same time.

62
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.600
Bill Cosby was there and he,
he,
uh,
and I said,
what do you,

63
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.560
how do you like run this empire?
You know,
cause he,
he found,
he created like,

64
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.810
here's where I found Ryan Seacrest's and putting him on.

65
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.720
He owns all these companies.
They really,
yes.
And he's got a radio.
Would Ryan was,

66
00:03:50.721 --> 00:03:53.410
I was,
did Ryan show way back?
He was on the radio.

67
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.610
He still does radio to see Chris has $100 million.

68
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.510
That motherfucker gets up every morning and does the radio from six to nine in

69
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.130
crazy work ethic and crazy work and listen to it.

70
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.600
It's almost like they're not human.
Yeah.

71
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.320
It's like the people that call aren't human and he's not human.

72
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:13.000
It's like a different species.
He's so nonthreatening.
He's so exactly.
You know,

73
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.150
what's your favorite color?
I,
he's another guy.

74
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.970
I ride booze.
Great.
Next color.
What's your favorite color?

75
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.710
Like?
No,
no,
no man.
There's no man on him.
All of robot.

76
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.840
Just Jamie from California.
What's your favorite food?
That's how it is.

77
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.010
No memories.
He's another guy I spent a week with.
Always in a suit.
What the fuck?

78
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.120
You guys weren't sort of for him.

79
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.060
I did this TV show where they're hosted and it's called,

80
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.820
it's called Bank of Hollywood.
I don't want to talk about it.
And he's in a suit.

81
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.990
He was always in a suit and I would try that one too,
right?
Yes.
He looked good.

82
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:54.570
He's a small guy.
Very small.
About 130 and one 35 about it.

83
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.850
And I didn't show when he had a talk show,
I didn't think he was that light.

84
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.140
I think you're exaggerating.
No,
five seven one 35 I give him,
I took him in.

85
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.470
You know you don't mean you did spend a week with them.
You already know.

86
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.770
You know how I take a man in,

87
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:09.150
I'll take a man in visually and even physically it's too much.
Yeah,

88
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.170
I'm pretty good at that stuff.
And he,
he ended up,
he ended up,

89
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.600
I said it was inside eight.
Yeah.
There you go.
Look at you.

90
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.230
I don't want to talk about that.
He's five.
He's five,
eight talent.

91
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.610
You hosted a show and how it's running secrets not the host and you were the

92
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:27.820
host.

93
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.020
Well cause he was producing it and they paid me a lot of money for just to do

94
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.180
for one day to do four episodes.
And I was like all right.

95
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.510
And then I have the option to get out and then I,
I called my agent,
I got good,

96
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.260
didn't it go well?
I didn't like what it was.
I don't listen.

97
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.700
It was people basically asking for money and I was duped into thinking it was

98
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:44.200
Morgan to be like a talk soup thing.

99
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.370
And the minute I got there they said we want to turn it into more of a talk
show.

100
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.920
And I said that's not what I do.
I don't want to do that.
Blah Blah Blah.

101
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.930
A talk show.
Yeah,
they kinda hit me.

102
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:55.270
Literally when I got there I thought it was going to be like I was going to be

103
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.130
doing a lot of comedy,
kind of a talk soup thing.

104
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.410
It funny and that's how they presented it to me and that's how the audition was.

105
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.820
And I got there and they all of a sudden they go,

106
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.130
we want you to wear a suit and just kind of read the teleprompter.

107
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.320
And I went and bought your stuff.
Yeah.

108
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.660
But I made a lot of money for a day and I tried to make connection with Ryan

109
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.830
Seacrest is a guy and he's just so professional.

110
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.570
He's just kind of one of those guys where he went.
I said,
how you doing man?

111
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.460
He's like,
you know,
I had made $13 million a year.
He's a robot.
I went,
I went,

112
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:21.890
so what are you up to man?
He's your Stengel and stuff.
He goes,

113
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.160
having a lot of fun,
having a lot of fun and that was all I could get out of.

114
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.990
There was no detail he's on.
It was just,
he wasn't willing to give those guys,

115
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.940
man.
Yeah,
we may not know who he is.
Your favorite color,
Brendan?
I'm like calm.

116
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.030
It's just you and me,
man.
Who gives a fuck?
Purple's a good color.

117
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.680
I think you'd look good in purple.
Okay.
Caller number three.
Like what?

118
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.710
My feet hurt.
Low feet can hurt.
All right.

119
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.680
It's so most of this has to getting nowhere with this.
This is what I tell.

120
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:51.420
You know what I mean?
Like he found a frequency.
He found like a,

121
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.550
there's a station in the dial that was available and it's a low hum and he's

122
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.960
easy to be stuck there and you're not going to get any fucking craziness out of

123
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.450
him and you're not going to get the wife smacking.

124
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.760
You're not going to get any fucking drunk driving.

125
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.940
You're not going to get any heroin.
He's a robot.

126
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.090
I would suck my Dick.
That's an impediment.

127
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.300
Even as description that he found a frequency

128
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.600
and it's like hosting American idol hosting,
like come on morning radio,

129
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.210
all raw and we're going to give away a free donut.

130
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.610
Like a Casey case of offense.
I'll ride.
I love donuts too.

131
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:29.540
We'll take the next caller.

132
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.030
It's like you got a role like the,

133
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.020
like the Truman show where the rest of the world like what the fuck are you

134
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:43.820
doing Tuesday?
It's Tuesday.
It's donut.
Tuesdays.
Everybody.

135
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.810
Yeah,
he's an odd dude.
But he used to be more um,

136
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.690
more fuck around d on the radio when,
when he used to do radio show,

137
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.040
I did his radio show up way,
way,

138
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:54.890
way back in the day before he was famous and he was more fuck around.

139
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.730
She was more controversial but that was what happened was he hit the fucking

140
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:03.140
mother load of money with American idol.
Remember is to host and they got one,

141
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.910
I think one guy left and he stayed and then American idol blew up.
Yeah,
he's,

142
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.540
he's a mom.
People like him and he works hard.
Oh,
he's a,

143
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:13.540
he's a work horse sona now.
Right?
Like you have a persona.

144
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:18.410
You got to keep that all the time.
He's that hum.
Fuck that.

145
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.700
I was getting high.
Nothing low.
Nothing crazy.
Not a way to live.

146
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.750
Well not for me or you can't be my friend.

147
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.060
See chaos it do.

148
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.020
I need a little self destruction so you don't have nothing.
I wonder why that is.

149
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:39.650
Why do we look,
I might kindred spirits are dudes like that.

150
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.830
The minute I hear there's like a little,
like a little fucking darkness.
I'm like,

151
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:47.660
well,
there we go.
Sorry.
I'm a little darkness with some construction.
Yeah,

152
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.290
I mean it's one of the things that we hit off with right away.
I was like,
oh,

153
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.490
I can trust this guy.
Yes.

154
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.220
Circle just as retarded,
but you could tell me anything.
I'd be like,

155
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.054
I understand.

156
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.260
Like literally I got to hide this body
color's red,
man.

157
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.760
That's fucking weird.
You see,

158
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.260
you see this guy who used to go to the boxing gym and I worked out at,

159
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.250
and he was gay,
but he didn't want to admit he was gay.
And uh,
he would,
uh,

160
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.000
tell us about stories about girls and it was one of the most bizarre thing.

161
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.180
So I was like,
man,
it was like a on this dance floor man.

162
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.560
This girl came up to me and you know,

163
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:29.310
just a totally just started making out with me and I was like,
hey,
back off.

164
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.850
Like what the fuck?
It's like,
well damn,

165
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.030
why the fuck did you say?
I remember in high school there was this guy,

166
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.490
this guy used to get a lot of girls in high school.
I remember one time he said,

167
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.470
I like to kiss girls,
and then when they tried to touch my chest I say,
no,
no,

168
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.750
I'm not ready for that because if they do that to me,

169
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.760
I do that to them and I remember I was like,
you saw the enemy

170
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.460
can't speak to anymore.
There's some guys,

171
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:01.200
especially like foreign guys,
I have some,

172
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.690
a lot of friends from England where you'll be like,
yeah,

173
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.480
I hooked up with this girl,
man.
She was a freak to all of us.
It's like,

174
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.730
oh cool man.
We know what that means though.
British guys like,
yeah,
what she do,

175
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.770
what exactly she do.
Well,
hey man,
she's a freak.

176
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.490
Sort of start making out.

177
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.210
Did you talk to you guys?

178
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.750
You immediately stop fucking he wear a condom or no condom.
What?
What?

179
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:28.260
What happens with the coach to come somewhere?
Yeah,
the boxing gym.

180
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.990
The way I described it as like,
like I don't know how to speak French,

181
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.600
but if you told me the words to say,
I could say them but I do,

182
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.770
wouldn't know what the fuck I was saying.

183
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.850
Great way of describing as a gay man trying to pretend he's straight and he was

184
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.180
saying all the stuff that you,
you mean sorta.

185
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.750
I know he's talking about being with a girl making out.
I was like,
wait,
what?

186
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.680
It was all off.
It was like poly vous Francais it's off man.

187
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.890
I don't even know if you know you're saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's so true.

188
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:57.590
The small of her back,
man,
when my hand Corinne's it's very,

189
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.680
it's very important to be able to trust dudes.

190
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.650
We were talking about that one football player was on,

191
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.290
what's that show we were talking about where they were like,

192
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.180
what's the most attractive part of a woman?

193
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:09.630
And I've always thought this guy was gay and he's at the buzzer.
He's like,
Eh,

194
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.640
her feet.
And everyone was like,
[inaudible]

195
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.900
you sir.
[inaudible]
I was like,

196
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.310
oh no.

197
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.280
Do before before him was like them big ass titties,

198
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:30.780
40 3004 1000 Jim,
me,

199
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.970
my answer would be I'd bang her if she didn't have feet.

200
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.330
So not that important to me.
You know,
my girl could have talent,

201
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.000
I would have no idea.
I don't give a fuck.
Right.

202
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:41.630
Just covering them up with a cloth,
but we'll figure it out.
You got it.

203
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:44.730
You can have of hobbit feet.
I don't know,
czar there.

204
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.980
The whole crowd was like,
damn,
it just ruined the whole show.

205
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.450
You're lying about your life.
All right.

206
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.280
Back to being treat on the feet.
I just fuck her and stare at her feet.

207
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.870
Put them in my mouth,
dude.

208
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.960
Sometimes there's those portals with these dudes are getting jacked up his feet.

209
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.880
My old girlfriend gun,
I had a girlfriend.

210
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.490
It's how many she's date data guy who I knew who used to put her feet in his

211
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:17.410
mouth when he was having sex and I was like always jealous boy.
Maybe.

212
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:21.400
Maybe,
maybe you like that and that's the one thing I don't do for you.
I never,

213
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.060
I never thought he would put her foot and yes ma'am.
Yeah,
it's not too.

214
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.230
She told you about that though.
What?
Wanting you to do it?
Well,

215
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.810
my Dick was in my hand.
No,
I,
yeah,

216
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.350
I don't know shit she did with other dudes.
Of course.

217
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:38.460
That's what I get in deep into that stuff.
I'm very curious and uh,

218
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.440
and I knew him and she said that he would put his,

219
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.860
he loved her feet and he'd put her entire foot in his mouth.
I was like,

220
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:49.690
well first of all,
I don't think I could do that.
Yeah.
Something deep throat.

221
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.370
Anyways,
back to Merv Griffin.

222
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:56.371
Merv Griffin was my friend went to have lunch at his house and he had just

223
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:01.210
hottest shit young dudes serving all over his mansion.

224
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.590
Just like the best look in suicide pieces.
Smoothed freeways.
Yeah.

225
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.010
Just well-groomed,
muscled,

226
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.750
beautiful young men.
If you're a young gay dude that the has to be the line.

227
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:15.520
He was about 65 at the time.

228
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.360
Young Gay Gay dudes period.
There's,

229
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:22.540
there's something to be said for that life because first of all,

230
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.180
they don't have kids unless they really want to.

231
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.720
They have to go out of their way to have the beast.
So they have all this money.

232
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.960
Right.
Cause they don't,
they have total disposable income.
Exactly.

233
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.650
Most of them don't have dudes they have to take care of.
And last.

234
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.550
They like older guys that are like hanging on and they have like these younger

235
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:44.300
dudes that don't have any money.
Liberace style.
So exactly.
They just guys,

236
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.760
there's always that one couple of young guys take the car keys.

237
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
There's always the young twinks who were into the older dudes into older dudes.

238
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:57.340
They're just not into working.
Yeah,
they're not in the work.

239
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:01.550
You said they get plowed.
You get a word,
you don't work this day.

240
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.760
You know it's not a nine to five but you clocking in on these nuts.

241
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.590
You know what I'm saying?
It will be some work.

242
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.440
You're going to get that work in an app at all the time.
Mother fucker

243
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.950
wake up with these old balls anytime they want.
They have deals.

244
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.300
They have to,
I don't want any lip.
No back doc can talk to mass moca.

245
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.410
When I won my Dick Suck.
This is no,
no conversation sucked a dick.

246
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.140
I remember I heard of a girl,

247
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:35.710
she was applying for a job out here at a doctor office and it was like an

248
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:39.190
assistant job and the doctor had in the contract that you have to give him a

249
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:43.720
blow job certain time during the day.
Ooh,
Shit.
Tight move doc.

250
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.830
That's some shit.
C'Mon got a contract contract written into the contract.

251
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:51.650
You know what I,
you know what that may be that be real.
I don't know this

252
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.690
<v 2>very recent.
No,
that girl could sue that guy so easily.
Yeah,
maybe that's a girl</v>

253
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.850
that's a girl.
Make a story up and she wants you to play doctor doctor with you,

254
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.820
Bro.
Well,
I had her sign the contract.
I'm not a doctor.

255
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.190
White lab coat.
Yeah.
I proclaimed myself of doctor.

256
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.050
I'm a doctor now
three and a level of expertise.

257
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:23.030
I'm a doctor of dark jokes.
Sign this.
So ridiculous.

258
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.850
The idea that that could be true.
I mean in my picture,

259
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.450
I just don't imagine that you can,

260
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.180
I don't think that you can make that a contract.

261
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.680
A girl would like maybe a picture of that.
Maybe it's like a deal.

262
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:36.200
You know what I'm saying?
That's prostitution.
Yeah.
Okay.

263
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.580
I just don't think it's slow.

264
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.140
Like I don't think you can have a sexual calm down somewhere around here.

265
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.860
I don't think you're allowed to have a sexual contract that would be binding.

266
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.260
Yeah,
because I think that like it would be considered prostitution though.
May.

267
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.880
Maybe.
Maybe the major you'd act.
Yes.

268
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.360
He says favors at 3:00 PM oh favors,
favors,

269
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.740
physical favors.
Physical errands.

270
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.580
I don't even think you could like put in a regular way.

271
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.850
I guess you could put in like you have to rub my back.
Yeah.

272
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.470
You can just be like,
Hey,
listen,
uh,
everything looks good here.
We agree on this.

273
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.190
The deal is,
you know,
it's on the contract,
but Friday's at three o'clock.

274
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.980
You need to suck this day.
Take a look at this.

275
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.680
This is a woman alive that wanted to guy to eat her pussy every Friday at three

276
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:29.300
o'clock.
I'm sure there's some thirsty doctors.

277
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:31.970
Female Dog,
49 right?
Yeah.

278
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.160
Divorced having nothing for like six shit.

279
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.250
If I didn't have this pocket as I thought I was going to have to start doing

280
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:41.330
that shit.
Fucking yeah,
I'll do it Friday.
We'll suck it.

281
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.950
Three will suck in the afternoon.

282
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.830
I will suck your titties at two o'clock but in the old days,

283
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:49.280
I'm sure they had contracts like that but low the we'll all laws against sexual

284
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:51.740
harassment.
I just passing the laws now.

285
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.720
Fucking laws fucking up everything man.
Back in the day.

286
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.150
Just the idea that you would have that in the contract.

287
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.780
Well marriage in marriage is not binding.
You don't have to,

288
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.550
you don't have to have sex in a mirror,
you know it's up to it's given.
Right,

289
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.393
right.

290
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.100
Well it's not though because we all know guys that don't do anything there.

291
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.900
They have a marriage with a,
yeah,

292
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.770
they have a roommate and they take care of their kids together.

293
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.370
We both know a quite a few families like that and we'll get together.

294
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:25.760
Brian and I will get the feeling of what the fuck cause they'll tell you like we

295
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:28.990
haven't had sex in a year and we got in in two years.
My buddy.
Amazing to me.

296
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.930
My Buddy,
uh,
was poor most of his life.
Okay.

297
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:37.931
I mean like the most he had ever made as an actor was like $40,000 a year.

298
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:40.400
That was like his best year.

299
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.450
Then he got a television show immediately after the television.
Joe,

300
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.930
his wife divorced him and now she wants for the next,

301
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:51.240
because they'd been married for 10,
she wants for the next five years,

302
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.920
half of what he was making when he was on the television show and alimony and

303
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:58.110
like the tough,
first of all,
everybody who,

304
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:02.460
if you get a television show you if you're lucky as fuck.
Yeah.

305
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.930
It goes a year.
If you're lucky as save that money,
if you're crazy lucky,

306
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:08.910
it goes two years.
If you hit to a show,

307
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.020
you get a show that's on syndication.
Oh my God.

308
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:15.720
How many people get to a show that's on city?
Very few.
Very few.

309
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.130
She ignored all the years that they were together,

310
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.490
all the years where they go,
that he was struggling like more than 10 years.

311
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:26.940
She ignored all ignore those years concentrated only on the one year that he was

312
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:29.160
on a sitcom and wanted half of that money.

313
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.680
So his Simpson ship,
man,
he had a kid,
we freaked the fuck out.

314
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.001
It was weird.

315
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:38.910
It was very hard for him because they are hard cause you have to maintain that

316
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:41.280
lifestyle.
Right?
Yeah.
That's the idea.

317
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.260
The idea that he was supposed to maintain her lifestyle and he was,
uh,
he was,

318
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:50.250
it was really hard because he has a son and he loves his kid and he wasn't

319
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:52.770
having sex with his wife.
He hadn't had sex with her for over a year.

320
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.960
Say that to me is already like,

321
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.250
there are so many people that ignore that major elephant in the room.
Sex.

322
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.820
Yeah man,
if you're married but you trying to get me to cheat on you,
right.

323
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.860
I mean if we're not having sex,
what do you think's going to happen?

324
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.040
But then that never is like,

325
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.110
I know two people who are in marriage is like that and they don't really discuss

326
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:13.650
that.
And I'm always like,
how are you living your life this way,
man?
Yeah.

327
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.370
How are you?
It's the same guys too.
Like when I was back in Denver,
my buddies,

328
00:19:17.371 --> 00:19:19.530
I was like,
Hey,
let's go out and like,
Oh man,
what should we tell him?

329
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.350
What should I tell him?
Like girl,
like what?
Tell your fucking going out man.

330
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.090
Like I know,
but we got come up with a plan.
I'm like,
what's the fucking plan man?

331
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.810
Just tell him we're going to go out.
They're all like worried.
Yeah,

332
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:35.070
it's the same guys,
man.
It's weird.
But you got me thinking about being an actor.

333
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:38.010
Like could you talk about if you'd had to just rely on fighting,
making a living.

334
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.460
I really feel that way about acting like thank God for the podcast and stand up.

335
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.020
I can't imagine having to worry about making my living as an actor and guess

336
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:50.700
what?
I work as an actor.
Well the [inaudible] a confining thing with you,

337
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:51.780
like your best,

338
00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:56.100
you're at your best like on podcasts or doing stand up cause you're free.

339
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.910
You can be you like no one is ever going to write you correctly.

340
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.320
They'll write a character version that you'll do your best to try to spice up.

341
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.570
But also you need their approval.
You need to be cast.

342
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.200
Do you need to be a part of like a,
a cast of people?

343
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:11.490
You need to get along with everybody.

344
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.210
You got to get to the set when they say you got to do all those things are

345
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:16.680
against what you are.

346
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.750
Well you are as is weird free spirit of grew up all over the world and you know,

347
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:22.230
you,

348
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.950
you kind of were on your own a little bit too much and see you made friends in

349
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:28.680
weird ways and see developed as fucking crazy personality.

350
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.380
But it translates as into funny.

351
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:35.430
It's a fucking go willy Wonka golden ticket to Willy Wonka golden ticket to

352
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:36.030
funny.

353
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:41.030
But that is this like it's like a side job and people get stuck in that side

354
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:45.930
job.
[inaudible] you should go on a bunch of auditions.
I got a crazy story.
Sorry,

355
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:47.680
I didn't mean go back to you.

356
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:51.460
I just want to know a lot dishes is the only two auditions I ever went on when I

357
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:55.150
was,
uh,
when I first started doing,
uh,
like the acting thing.

358
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.900
I've got the TV shows.
Yup.
The only two I ever went on a show called hardball.

359
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.360
Got It.
And then show called news radio.
Got It.

360
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.270
Are those the only two auditions I ever did and he got both.
I got Bolton.

361
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:07.280
How rare is that?
It's impossible.
It doesn't make sense.
It's,
see Ya,

362
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.380
I have two shows.
I went to syndication,
that's insane.
Anyone on addition?

363
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:15.010
And the director asked me to do it in a different way and he goes,
you can't,

364
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.340
you can call me right after.
And he goes,
you know what?
Nah,
well aren't you?

365
00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:20.174
You're skinny lane.

366
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.140
Rd Lang was in the movie and there's the only reason why I was willing to do in

367
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:26.950
the first place.
So it was going to do with rd.
Right.
And the guy goes,
all right,

368
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.730
I read it as you know,
prepared.
And then he goes,
okay,
if the,

369
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.820
it was a little annoying to hear like pompous English guy and he goes,

370
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.100
okay,

371
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.100
well I want you to do now is you all trying to get him very interested in being

372
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:42.220
married?
Okay,

373
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.290
you'll married and you're going to write this down on a piece of paper.
Here's a,

374
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:50.020
here's a pen,
here's a marker,
and you're going to,
you're going to write,

375
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.390
just married and you get a hold it up like you're going,

376
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.120
you're trying to convince him that you want him to be married.
I go,
listen,

377
00:21:58.121 --> 00:22:01.870
first of all,
I'm not,
I'm not acting,
I'm not,

378
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.180
I'm not sitting here talking to Artie Lange.
Okay?

379
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.090
I'm talking to a pa who could barely read the dude,
barely could read.

380
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.470
I mean he was reading it like,
like Floyd Mayweather.

381
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.180
Do you think it's a good thing for us to be out like this at night?

382
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:21.130
Fuck you.
Is it a good thing?
Come on man,
I go have fun.
You know,

383
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:24.640
so I'm supposed to be convincing this guy that marriage is the key to him.

384
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.450
You know,
I want you to buy just married.
Don't this piece of paper.
I go,

385
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.220
if we were on the set and you wanted me to help write your movie,

386
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.260
you wanted me to help make the movie better.

387
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:39.400
I would ad lib a whole scene where I say just married.
I go,
but I'm,

388
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.880
no,
I'm not going to do that.
Not here.
I go,
we're in a conference room.
No,
I got,

389
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.820
this is a PA.
I go,
no,
I'm not going to do that.
Like this is what do you,
what?

390
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.730
What the fuck is he just peaced out?
Yeah.
I said I won't do this now.
And I left.

391
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.980
It was the last time you were out did I think?
No,
I did Kevin James Movies.

392
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.380
But uh,
but I only did it cause I like Kevin,
but uh,
they,

393
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.440
my agent called me up.
You can't do that.
I'm like,
Oh fuck.

394
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.050
What do you mean I can't do,
I didn't want to do it.
I didn't want to do it.

395
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:06.190
Don't tell me I can't do that.

396
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:08.420
I think you're one of the only guys who can pull that off.
Right.

397
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.910
I couldn't pull it off.
I didn't pull it off.
I didn't get the role.
I tanked out.

398
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.420
Yeah,
but that personality trait is what got you to where you were like,
no,

399
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:17.230
I'm a maybe.

400
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:22.150
Maybe it was hard to be an actor though with that personality trait because
what?

401
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.740
I agree it's such a collaborative effort.
No,
I knew,
I could see through the,

402
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.100
through the fucking looking glass that this was an unbelievable steaming log of

403
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:35.540
a movie.
It was up,
but you don't want to be associated with I do.
You want to,

404
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.450
I felt it coming.
I knew it was coming.

405
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.650
I had already done a bad sitcom when I did that hardball show.

406
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:44.230
It was a bad sitcom and it started off good.

407
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.310
But all these fucking people got involved

408
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.520
<v 0>and the original writers were really funny guys that were on the Simpsons and</v>

409
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.130
married with children.
But then again,

410
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.140
all these fucking like professional hack guys who make these hacky sitcoms and

411
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:59.090
they'd make jokes like they,
they ruined it,

412
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.050
write jokes and I been there before and it's hell you would think it's like,

413
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.320
it's easier to work a job than it is to work a show where like it could be funny

414
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.810
and it turns out to be awful cause you're so conflicted as a comic when you know

415
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:17.720
something is really bad,
it's like I need to know funny.

416
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.700
You'll know if it was different than like getting paid to work at the fucking,

417
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.140
uh,
lumber yard,
you know,

418
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.220
carrying logs.
But it paid you 25 grand a week.
You'd be like,
oh well you know,

419
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.670
or a Sitcom the pays 25 grand a week.
But it's terrible.

420
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.750
I swear to God it's better to carry the logs.
Fuck that.

421
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.850
Cause the logs don't make you feel bad after.
It's,

422
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.650
if you don't feel like you're selling your soul well,
you know,
you're like,

423
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.330
you're just working.
You key into that.

424
00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:50.300
Like I had like I had to really have a talk with myself.

425
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.640
I came out here to be an actor 20 years.

426
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.140
I studied it for years and I love by it.
I'm doing a show now,

427
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.010
I the other day and I said,
I was talking to my mother and I said,

428
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.810
I've never been on a set as an actor where I wasn't looking forward to it being

429
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.730
over like I was.
Yes.

430
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.390
Now think about that some in my whole life I worked really hard at being an

431
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:14.690
actor.
I really did have.
I been successful moderately,

432
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.650
but I worked hard at it and spend a lot of time in traffic going on auditions.

433
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.500
It's been a lot of anxiety trying to get jobs.
Sometimes I got him.

434
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.490
Most of the time I didn't,
but I want to have landed big jobs.

435
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.830
I've never been on a set where I was where I couldn't wait for it to be over.

436
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.750
Did you wake up excited though?
Nope,
I sure.
Why the fuck do it well,

437
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.780
that's why I do podcasts and stand up now and when I go on some auditions and

438
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.680
nice sound,
I listened for wonder woman.
Haven't heard back from Patty.

439
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.583
She should get it.

440
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.240
I felt I loved them when Abbot Kinney grabbing lunch and you're like,
fuck,

441
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:52.740
I should be an audition.
What do you mean?
When?

442
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.550
When you might have an audition coming up the way.
Oh,
and I forgot all.
Fuck,

443
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.600
and I forgot.
You just like,
fuck it.
I love that.

444
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:03.530
Let's cause everything's going well.
Look,
you're great at being Brian Count.

445
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.370
That's the real problems.
The best.
That's what I'm good at.

446
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.050
I'm doing good at hitting me,
man.
You're going to be in you.
You know,

447
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.630
like there's something in that and they can't,
you can't manufacture that.
No.

448
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.370
Tried.
I've tried.

449
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.170
I've cried on auditions where I've cried and a very dramatic scene and I got

450
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:22.130
seven people I don't know,

451
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:26.750
looking at me and I'm fucking crying but doing the lines and I'm fucking good.

452
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.670
Didn't get it.
But still I'm walking out wiping my tears.
They're like,

453
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:34.530
Brian,
you have very fine actor.
I'm like,
thank you very much.
Know.

454
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.170
I think that's the character.
It's the honors went home.

455
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.090
Part of me dying inside is nothing wrong with really enjoying that.

456
00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:44.100
Like my friend Stephen Root from Newsweek,
right actor,
who's a great

457
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 2>actor.
He's been in the medical boardwalk.
Camba fantastic guy.</v>

458
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.270
He's been in boardwalk empire office space,
a million different movies.

459
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.540
That guy is hilarious and he's always working and he loves becoming a new

460
00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:00.930
character.
He loves it.
He has a craft so people love it.

461
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.250
Bradley Cooper and Bradley Cooper love lasting more than anything like was an

462
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.850
actor's studio and obsessed over little details about the character and how his

463
00:27:09.851 --> 00:27:12.800
shirt is.
Listen man,
that's why he can do Americans timer.

464
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.310
Do you need those guys go?
Well,
there's the same thing and fighting too.

465
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:19.360
There's some guys who love that shit.

466
00:27:19.361 --> 00:27:22.890
It's like the D as mothers love to be in the thick of things getting hit in the

467
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:26.770
face.
How feral Dosantos this guy.
See,

468
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.200
can we say officially you're done.
You're done.
Officially say it.

469
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:38.640
Don't listen to him.
Listen to me.
It's over.
Devil Angel.

470
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.290
No kidding.
Listen,

471
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.110
dude,
you you.

472
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:49.710
If you don't like making a lot of money talking and doing what comes naturally.

473
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:52.740
And if you'd rather go in there and get punched in the face by monsters,
please,

474
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.950
whatever you want.
I'm just here to support whatever decision you make.

475
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.650
Take a deep breath and don't say anything.
You know what the thing is?

476
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:02.400
I'm not officially doing anything for me it's just,
uh,
you know,

477
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:05.350
things are going so good.
It's just like,
you know,

478
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:07.440
and with the Reebok deal and all that stuff,

479
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:10.530
I just don't like the direction that it's going.
It doesn't make sense to me.

480
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.550
So I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and he's going to suck down 85

481
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.920
there,
I assume to down in one seven kitchen,

482
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.580
just like dead dead.

483
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.830
Could you imagine what you would look like at one seven that you would be a

484
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:25.650
skeleton but it doesn't have to put them in a drama that has been a medically

485
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:27.340
induced coma for five months.

486
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.270
This is a good point to talk about because now that they're,
um,

487
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.970
the new standards,
the new testing standards,

488
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.350
they're not allowing ivs anymore.
Fucking stupid.
Explain that to me.
Well,

489
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:42.200
because you could blood dope,
so they're checking,
they're checking for interest,

490
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.110
all levels of plastic,
but it's dangerous when you do that because it takes,

491
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.340
they say almost seven days to fully hydrate yourselves the way they were when

492
00:28:50.341 --> 00:28:52.260
you were drinking.
And like with an IFE,

493
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:57.261
you can hydrate much faster traumas way more likely when you're dehydrated and

494
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:00.600
you don't have time in 24 hours to drink yourself hydrated.

495
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.620
I think they're taking it too far now they're taking a little too far,

496
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:07.380
but is there an argument to be made for the fact that they're just going to cut

497
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:11.040
out weight cutting now and that would be better for everybody or would they

498
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:14.310
never cut out weight cutting when people take a chance and fight dehydrated

499
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:16.560
dudes are always going to cut weight.
Do you know Andy Foster?

500
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:19.320
He's the director of the California State Athletic Commission.

501
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.730
Any foster is the,
as far as I'm concerned,

502
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.320
he's the most hard line guy.

503
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.320
He's a guy who has been involved in martial arts for a long time.

504
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.720
He's fought and he's a real fan.

505
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:34.830
And if fucking smart guy and he runs a tight ship,
California's tight,
tight shit.

506
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.810
I love this guy.
I love what he's doing.

507
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.990
But he suspended Sheila Manco for three fucking years or steroids,

508
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:45.700
right?
Sheila Manco pissed hot.
He suspended him for three years.

509
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.150
He essentially canceled his career like 100%.
Dan,

510
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:54.200
you think that's fair?
Know there's a debate.
I mean,
I don't know.
I,
I,

511
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.550
part of me goes,
I like the fact that he takes a hard line,

512
00:29:57.551 --> 00:29:59.340
that people can't do steroids anymore,
but another flag,

513
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.780
like this guy doesn't have a chance now he can't even get off of them.

514
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:06.970
But he can,
he can get out of California and fight.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

515
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:10.630
no,
no,
no.
I mean,
he can fight in like China.
You should fight in China.

516
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:13.330
You can go to fuck.
Yeah,
he's got a contract with [inaudible].

517
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.240
I don't even think you can do that.
Like that's the Vandelay Silva thing.

518
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.660
Like when Vandelay Silva ran away from the task,
which by the way,

519
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.460
Vandelay Silva was exonerated.
He got,
uh,
the,

520
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.990
the bank gave him a lifetime ban in California though,

521
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.030
but the court decided that that was an invalid.
You can't do that,
which is great.

522
00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:31.690
She retire anyways.
He should retire.

523
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.770
Evangelist had some crazy wars and he's an all time,
all time legends.

524
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.080
But if I had to say like my favorite fighters,

525
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:42.560
the fight fighters that like when they're about to fight and I went,
whew.

526
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.780
Vandelays around 2% top top of the list.

527
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.470
When you saw the annually Silva fight and pride,
you saw some fucking chaos.

528
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.700
By the time I got to see him fight live,
it was already he was facing.
Yeah.

529
00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.600
Damn Bro.
What he had to do.
That tissue completely flattened.
Yeah.

530
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.660
But his face was,

531
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:05.200
the scar tissue was so bad in his eyebrows that he would just get nicked and it

532
00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:08.380
would just open up a giant Gash.
It was just all scar.

533
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.380
Like there's some closeup photos of vandelays eyes,

534
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:14.740
like you see the amount of scar tissue.
He had his crystal ball wars man.

535
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.490
When when I found out Gilbert Gilbert Melendez,
Ted's pause for steroids,

536
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:22.350
I almost fell out of my chair.
He's the first one where I was like me.

537
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.840
It was John Fitch.
Nah,
John fits of the cow,
whatever.

538
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:30.580
John Fitch he was used to talk about.
I know,
I know.
That's fucking insane.

539
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.650
That that leads me to the question of if they have such stringent testing for

540
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:36.340
steroids,

541
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.340
I feel like you're not going to see guys fighting into their thirties they're

542
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:44.020
not going to be able to compete.
And I think Gilbert Melendez,

543
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:48.250
who you know is an all time where he's one of my favorites,
just period.

544
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.330
I love that guy.
And I think that,
you know,

545
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.080
Gilbert Melendez and people like that who are now in their thirties training on

546
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:59.760
that level.
I think what you're going to see is,
you know,

547
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.280
it's not possible that you could make the argument that it's not possible to

548
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:07.570
find on a high level and you got to react at 30 in your thirties without some

549
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:11.470
help.
Okay.
Okay.
James is just know that it's,
it's evolution came.
Okay,

550
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:14.020
but so your career is going to last.
Let's say half as long.

551
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:15.830
That's a hard pill to swallow for dudes.

552
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.670
Get to get their whole life looking at me.
I know,
I get it.
I know.

553
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.140
I'm just saying that you know,
you can't compete anymore,
you know,

554
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.130
and you've got to do steroids and it might be tiny,
but like

555
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.120
maybe this isn't the life for you.

556
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.750
Well he's an interesting case because he's got a legitimate medical issue.

557
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.260
Tumor in his pituitary gland eat that shit.
He's a different case.
But the,

558
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.840
he was a totally different animal when he fought Mark Hunt.

559
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.770
He could take monster bombs to the head.

560
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:48.010
I mean Mark Hunt hits as hard as fuck and he's one of the best strikers ever in

561
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:52.640
the heavyweight division and Mark Hunt hit him with bombs and him in big foot

562
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:56.330
went five fucking rounds of death is so much so that I have a,

563
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.100
a roots of fight jacket.

564
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:02.990
The Dana White had made a Mark Hunt bigfoot Silva too.
And it was,

565
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.890
he was so hyped up about the rematch that he had Jessie from roots of fight,

566
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:10.430
make a limited run of these Mark Hunt,
big foot silver,
two shirts,

567
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.520
and then the test came out and he got busted for having silver back.

568
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:17.990
Gorilla levels of testosterone.
I'm saying though,

569
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.250
but so if he's going to do that stuff,
okay,
can't compete.
Go find something else.

570
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:25.940
Go Do Jujitsu.
But he's really good.
You know he's a good fighter.

571
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.180
Mean you watched his knockout of Overeem.
I want to see that guy fight.

572
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.550
I want to see that guy fight.
Yeah.

573
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.560
So do you say that they're all loud to have a certain level of testosterone you

574
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:38.120
have to do.
I think with this new testing that they're doing,

575
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:39.920
we're going to see more guys get busted.

576
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.380
We're going to see a watered down version of the UFC,

577
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.820
which we don't need right now.
Right.

578
00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.700
It's already kind of watered down with how many shows were putting on.

579
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.250
I keep saying we like,
I'm fucking working on the bus,

580
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.940
but how many shows you Yossi puts on?
It's becoming a little too much.

581
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.150
Well now you take away all that,
you do all this testing,

582
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.030
you can get guys not doing shit and you can get some bullshit.

583
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.500
That's what pet narrows.
And although we're saying,
you know,

584
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.950
they were saying look like you want a task,
okay,
you could task,

585
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.140
but you're gonna have less exciting fights.
100% yeah,
it's true.
And that's,

586
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.900
but that's a real question.
I mean,
I dunno,
I feel like,

587
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.000
I feel like if I were a bay,

588
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.390
like if I had a favorite baseball player and I mean

589
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.340
I'm not trying,
it's so complicated in a way.

590
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:25.850
Like I had a favorite baseball player and his bat speed start slowing down in 31

591
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:29.600
32 and with testosterone he could play for another six years.

592
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:32.980
I don't want to see him today for 62 yeah.
Well how about I guess I that clients,

593
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.780
yeah,
man.
Roger Clemens is in his 30 or it is 49 yeah.

594
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.330
He got up in age and he was actually getting better.
Yes.
Throwing.
Fantastic.

595
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.260
The problem with that now,

596
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.230
if Michael Jordan could've played 10 more years doing steroids,
let them do it.

597
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.030
But there's a difference between that and fighting,
right?

598
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.630
I agree 100% and Rhonda,
Rhonda because fighting hurts the other guy like,
yes.

599
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.180
Well Rhonda Rousey did an interview once and she said it best.

600
00:34:54.181 --> 00:34:58.790
She's like this person,
if they're on steroids,
they can land shots.
They weren't,

601
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.370
wouldn't be able to land.
They wouldn't have the energy to land.

602
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.910
If they weren't on it,
they would be able to get things off a lot.

603
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.670
Doping and hurts.
You can turn the tide.
They could wind up winning the,

604
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.840
they can do things they couldn't do if they were charitable and non sports is

605
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:14.480
different because you're talking about health concerns.
Yeah,

606
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.360
well you're talking about doing damage to somebody and that damage could

607
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:18.840
essentially be permanent like hmm.

608
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:24.140
No one knows better than you that the amount of training that you have to do in

609
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:28.280
order to get in tip top shape to fight is fucking ungodly.

610
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.240
God.

611
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.180
You said that that you can only really maintain that level of fitness for like

612
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:34.310
two weeks before the shit starts popping and break.

613
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.000
You only have the peak when before you're to fight.
You've got a month,

614
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.160
you got about a month at that level,

615
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:46.190
at that really high level doing three a days wrestling practice,

616
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.060
fucking battle ropes and fucking dead lifts and all that crazy shit and you're

617
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:53.320
going to war you ready to go to what you're,
you're got your,

618
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.293
<v 3>because</v>

619
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:59.970
<v 2>you got that fucking engine light light and you can only do it for so long and</v>

620
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.930
the amount of effort that you put in,
there's a direct correlation which we,

621
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:09.000
the effort that you put in and what you can do when you actually get into the

622
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:11.930
octagon on fight day.
If you are a guy like,

623
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.860
like a dos Joe's versus a June 1st sentence up Anthony pedestal,

624
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:17.694
perfect example.

625
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:22.830
Dolson Joe's trained like a fucking wild Damon and because that he had this

626
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:27.210
insane cardio,
he was working out with the Marinovich.
This guy nick curse on you.

627
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:30.420
Isn't that podcast right?
Curse out a fucking genius man.

628
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.210
And it would talking about the strength and conditioning work those guys did.

629
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.500
I mean he's breaking them,
just breaking them.

630
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.580
Now they're like Marinovich had Bj Penn in the best fucking shape his life.

631
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:43.290
But when beach I talked about,
he's like,

632
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:46.360
I couldn't hold my daughter in my arms when I got back home.

633
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.930
I'll get home from training.
I couldn't hold my daughter.

634
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.460
Like he would try to hold his daughter's life,

635
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.050
but when it came time to fight time and Diego Sanchez was in front of them,

636
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.940
we got to see all time.
Great.
Bj Penn,
when Bj looked across the fucking cage,

637
00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:03.260
he has those crazy eyes you like best.
Yeah,

638
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.950
I think the person who has it,
they got fucking Bj Penn jacket.

639
00:37:06.951 --> 00:37:11.330
Motherfucker down deals.
That's right.
And when did at j pen Prodigy Bitch,

640
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.370
I'm not mad at that.
And it all had to fight style.
No,

641
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.800
I mean that the person who has it down to who was kind of the first person that

642
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:22.550
talked about doing these short camps was a Ben Henderson.
We'd had,

643
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.790
we did an event together and I,
I was,
I forget who I was fighting,

644
00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:28.220
but as a guy about to go into camp man,
he's like,
when's your fight?

645
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.480
And I was like,
like three months.

646
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:32.720
He's like camp the like going to camp for right now.
I was like,

647
00:37:32.721 --> 00:37:34.580
when do you do your camps?
Like five weeks,
man,

648
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.940
I trained so much when I go into camp,
you know everything's red lining,

649
00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:41.780
so I just five week camps,
but he's never out of shape.
He's never asked shape.

650
00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:43.640
He's a lighter guy and he's always in the gym,

651
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.120
but he's saying when five weeks out he's sparring doing three days.

652
00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:50.240
He can only do that for that long and he's not getting hurt.
You see Ben,

653
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:53.510
he's never,
never seen that.
I'm tired either.
He's an animal.
He,

654
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.330
I liked the fact that he's going up to one 70 and now that they're taking away

655
00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:59.720
the ivs,
you're going to see a lot of that.
You're going to see a lot of that.

656
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.070
Yeah.
A lot of guys are going to be forced to it,

657
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.700
but also you're going to see a lot less endurance because I guarantee you guys

658
00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:07.070
were blood doping guarantee you.

659
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.270
I know for a fact guys were blood coursing.

660
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.920
I know for a 20 fighting for 25 minutes.

661
00:38:12.921 --> 00:38:16.820
Anybody's ever wrestled for six minutes or nine minutes,

662
00:38:16.821 --> 00:38:20.540
God forbid when it goes into overtime or whatever.
That's such a long time.

663
00:38:20.541 --> 00:38:21.690
It's such an easy on this.

664
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.670
When you literally want to die in six minutes is a crazy shit in the world.

665
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.390
25 minutes.
When I watch these guys kicking,
punching in wrestling for 25 minutes,

666
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:34.410
it's kind of unnatural.
I don't know how you get an that kind of shape.
I mean,

667
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:39.340
I do.
There's a lot of guys who do it now.
Well,
no,
no,
no,
no.

668
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.510
Don't,
don't get it twisted.

669
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:42.570
A lot of guys get in that shape without all that shit.

670
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.200
I'm never used shit in my life raising crazy shit,
so don't get it twisted.

671
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.660
They don't even sniff protein powder.

672
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.620
You know what I'm saying is when you take supplements,
yeah,

673
00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:54.700
but there's a lot of guys that don't take anything and they're fine and they're

674
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:59.160
fine.
They're freaks.
There's a fine,
certainly genetic advantages have,

675
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.070
some people absolutely have genetic advantages and you know you can't get around

676
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.460
that.
There's just no matter who also can't get around guys using steroids,

677
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:09.100
looking for an advantage because there's so much money involved in the sport.

678
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.350
It's an individual sport.
Steroids.

679
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:13.900
I don't give a fuck if he tests the guy every single day.

680
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.070
Steroids will find its way to the game.
It's part of history.

681
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.810
I was watching Chris Kamozi versus Jack Era.
Uh,

682
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.350
the second fight and a exactly like the first one.
What's that?
Exactly.

683
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.250
And I was watching this and I was thinking to myself,
okay,
this is the,

684
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:33.620
first of all,
Chris Kamasi has got balls.
He's a tough fucking dude.
Okay.

685
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.380
If game is the comm games,
they come,

686
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.960
takes his fight short notice against the guy who already beat him,

687
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.910
already strangled them the first time they fought,
right?

688
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.830
So here he is again with this fucking monster in front of him,
right?

689
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.340
He got an arm triangle,
like a white belt,

690
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:48.550
and the first fight he's got Jack Array could do that to black belts.

691
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.600
You need to do it to anyone that you see.
I mean,
did,
he would just manhandle you.

692
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.430
He just runs right through you,
right?
He's,

693
00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:58.770
his Jujitsu is so tight and you so fucking physically strong.

694
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.780
He learned his Dj.
See where he'd come out and it's Brazil,
but what,

695
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:04.450
what school was there a p?
That's a good question.
Good question.

696
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.960
The time world champion.
Anyways.
Anyways,
point is,

697
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:10.540
I was watching those two together and I was watching them move around.

698
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:12.460
Jacqui's closing the distance on him and I'm like,

699
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:13.840
these are two different species.

700
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.300
This Jocko remains physically super athlete.
He's fucking shredded.

701
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.460
He's got giant pipe.
Don's for arms.
His biceps go down to his forearm.

702
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.630
Like when I met John Gray,

703
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:28.840
the first time I met John Gray was before he even was doing,
um,

704
00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:33.670
he was doing a MMA,
he was only doing Jujitsu.
I met him in 2003 in Brazil.

705
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.670
His bicep goes down to here.
Wow.

706
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.450
It goes down like it's longer than it's supposed to be.
He had leverage.

707
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.280
Makes you insanely strong.
He's just got so much Jujitsu.

708
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:48.730
She's drawn to choke and he's a great athlete.
He's just a natural.

709
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:53.590
Any works that Hossein,
he's an animal,
but it's like Yoel Romero.
Yeah,

710
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:58.060
exactly.
It's an animal.
Joma Merrill is actually a better exam.
So what do you do?

711
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.730
So,
so if they're nuts Kamozi I'm saying is you give Chris Commodity all the

712
00:41:01.731 --> 00:41:04.060
steroids in the world.
He's not gonna beat Yoel Romero.

713
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.120
He's not going to be that guy.
He's never going to be that guy.

714
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.960
He's a different guy.
I mean commodes he's tough as shit.
He'll beat the fuck out.

715
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.700
A lot of dudes at 185 he's world class.
But that Yoel Romero Guy,

716
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.120
when you watch that guy chase after Machida,

717
00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:22.990
so he's fucking 40 [inaudible] curve,

718
00:41:22.991 --> 00:41:25.600
his learning curve.
A silver.
What do you do?
It's a good question.

719
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.430
That's a good question is you can see why I get to like fuck it.
Well,
I mean,
um,

720
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.360
I don't know.
I don't know what you can,

721
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.090
it's the same thing that people who are not that athletic just don't play in the

722
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:39.290
NFL.
Now I did becomes this sport is if the money's going to be there,

723
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.960
this sport is going to attract more Yoel Romero is and,
and Jakarta.

724
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.540
It's just because you know that Yoel Romero or you're not,
uh,

725
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.590
terrail Owens from the NFL.
Right.

726
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.300
And fighting might be different because there's so much skill and technique.

727
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:57.510
Five things different because less than 1% are Ronda Rousey's there.

728
00:41:57.511 --> 00:41:59.720
Jon Jones or Cain Velasquez also.

729
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.910
There's also some people like genetically have power.

730
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.750
Yes,
and you won't get that.
You do not going to get it right.
Just can't just,

731
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:11.720
you can't get,
you don't have,
the scaffold is like he's exactly,

732
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.260
exactly like these Mike Tyson characters.
Like did you just,
you can't.

733
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.720
You can teach Mike Tyson perfect technique.

734
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.590
You can show Mike Tyson how to throw punches perfectly and how to be you.

735
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:25.910
What you're never going to do is develop that kind of power.
It's called us.

736
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:29.840
You have that body,
you will.
There's nothing can do.
Like Floyd Mayweather is,

737
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:34.400
in my opinion,
the best boxer ever.
If you want to talk about boxer,

738
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.780
he gets hit the least.
He's beaten everybody,
everybody in front of them,
everyone.

739
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.590
It's arguable that his error is not as talented as the era of sugar ray Leonard

740
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:43.311
or all those other guys,

741
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:47.630
but when it comes to like the ability to hit and not get hit and my opinion,

742
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.600
he's the best.
He's not my favorite.
My favorite is Roy Jones,
Jr likers.

743
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:56.250
Roy Jones Jr was killed.
He was a motherfucker and he would,

744
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.490
I mean,
he just had his own style.

745
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:02.660
There was just like so much about Roy Jones who was just in his prime during

746
00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:06.730
those few years.
We use red line when he was at the top,
virtually untouchable.

747
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.730
Untouchable.
The only God can do thou.
Yeah.
That's the devil screen shots.

748
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.190
Nat and clown and dude's clowning dudes and put his hands behind his back.
Guys,

749
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:18.020
I wouldn't want to make it a show of,
I mean,

750
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:22.190
he knocked out virtual hill with a body shot frame with a right hand,

751
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.430
not even on the liver.
Right.
Throw it on the right,
on the left side of his body.

752
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:28.820
Wow.
Go to sleep.
Just [inaudible].
He's so God damn hard.

753
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.520
I think the thing and fighting,
I don't mean to interrupt,

754
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.030
but I'm going to get to the power thing.
But Floyd Mayweather,

755
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.440
we'll never be able to punch like Tommy Hearns.

756
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.540
He'll never be able to punch like Julian Jackson.

757
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.410
He'll never be able to punch like John the beast.
Will Gabi or Marvin Hagler.

758
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.650
They don't have his footwork though.
That's true.
Words elusiveness absolutely.

759
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:49.760
He's a better boxer.
He's a better boxer.
But that power thing,

760
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.710
you either have that thing or you do not have that thing correct and you can't,

761
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:56.200
can't teach it to beat.
Yeah.
You know the,
the thing,

762
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.520
the difference in fighting these other sports,

763
00:43:58.521 --> 00:44:02.270
let's say on the see this 53 guys and NFL roster,

764
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:06.500
let's Say I'm the the 50th Beth best player on the San Francisco 40 niners.

765
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.710
I'm making a good living.
I'm really not suffering that much damage.

766
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.780
Let's Say I'm the 50th ranked fighter in the UFC.
It's not a pretty life man.

767
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.370
It's not great.
You know what I'm saying?
No,

768
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.050
because I'm still doing exactly what the number one guy is doing as far as

769
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.710
getting hit competitions,
fighting camps,
everything,

770
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:27.110
but I'm not getting the same payment.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

771
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.440
And you're getting hurt or gets hurt.
Him.
You getting bad at all the time.

772
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:33.240
You think about what you're making a year,
you make him like 30 grand a year.

773
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.040
Josie Aldo,
they not Josie Aldo.
All the press he did for the UFC.
Right.

774
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.310
You don't get paid for that press.
Not only that,
just can't think.

775
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:45.030
Got His camp and then he has to go through all that and then he gets hurt.
What?

776
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.970
12 days,
14 days before the fight?
15 days.
So all that work,
you don't get it.

777
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.520
You don't get paid for any of that.
What's your,
uh,
are you excited about this?

778
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:58.470
Chadman is a kind of a very excited,
very excited about as excited as,

779
00:44:58.471 --> 00:45:01.040
although if not more really.
Yup.

780
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.650
Do you think that it's obviously a very,
you know,

781
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.670
they have this golden boy kind of McGregor and the,
you know,

782
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:10.380
it feels like Chad Mendez is a,

783
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.110
this is a big challenge because I think Chatham message should be the saver and

784
00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:18.300
they show me the favor.
100%.
It should be placed.
Amaze that somehow.

785
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:23.070
Some way they didn't choose someone like Nate Diaz.

786
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.830
Why did they choose Chad Mendez over this?
Just,
first of all,

787
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:28.530
Nate Diaz is in a different weight class.
He's never made one 45 minutes.

788
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.181
Second of all,

789
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:35.181
Chad Mendez knocked Ricardo lamas dead dead with one punch.

790
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.440
I just got smashes.
Dude's goes after God.
It's a bad,

791
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.270
it's a bad,
and I got agree with Brian on this.

792
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:45.870
I think it's a bad business idea for the UFC to put Chadman is in there.

793
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:49.800
I think if there's two horrible matchups for Connor,
Chad Mendez,
Frankie Edgar,

794
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:54.510
let's do whatever we can to get Connor to fight Aldo in October.
Um,
so see,

795
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.373
I disagree.

796
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.670
I think Chad Mendez easily could be as big a star as Conor McGregor.

797
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.060
He wouldn't talk like Conor Mcgregor did,
but needed to.
George Saint Pierre,

798
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.510
George St Pierre was the biggest paper,

799
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:07.410
if you star of all time because he was a gentleman and he was a fuck.

800
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.560
He was George,
George,
George,
George and Chapman does.

801
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.610
It is going to be twice by Jose Aldo that that's,

802
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.500
that's the last fight was razor close.

803
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.230
And there's an argument that can be made that if they fought in America,

804
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:21.930
he would have won that decision.
There's also an argument to be made that if,

805
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.621
if Josie,

806
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:26.050
although it didn't land that late punch after the first round that knocked

807
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.290
Mendez down to defend Mendez,
very hurt.

808
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.480
It could have been a very different fight.
Chad Mendez,

809
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.650
who knows how badly he got hurt by that late.
He's lost to him twice.
True,

810
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.950
but then he beats Lyft.
Let's say worst case scenario for the UFC.

811
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:42.270
If I'm UFC marketing team,
it's like,
God,
Connor cannot get exposed.
Let's not.

812
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.770
If he goes in and gets the out in the first round,
don't think later.

813
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.350
You going to do,
I think like that I do.

814
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.640
Because who's your biggest star right now?
Rhonda.
Connor.
Yes.
It goes in there.

815
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.920
He's talked a lot trash that we lost hundreds.
Actually,

816
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:54.780
probably a bigger star than Ryan,
which is crazy.

817
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.560
He would be by far the biggest star if he wins this fight.

818
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.980
Let me tell you something.
If Chad Mendez goes out there and starches him,

819
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.340
still not as Josh Connor a man.
I don't know about all that.

820
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.390
I'll tell you the degree,
but let me tell you this,
this,
this.

821
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.660
Here's some real facts.
The F the,

822
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.420
the numbers of tickets that are sold for this fight.
Okay,

823
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:14.670
this is going to break box office records in Vegas.

824
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.210
Dana White told me that the tickets had plateaued.

825
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.120
Nobody was buying more tickets when all doe pulled out.

826
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.990
And then Connor was forced to fight Chad Mendez tickets.

827
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:29.200
Sales Spike.
Really?
They went crazy.
I wonder how many were available though.

828
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.320
There wasn't much available,
but people were buying them scout.
But um,

829
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.600
Chad's family and friends bought tickets.
Dude,

830
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.360
I'm telling you there's a real spike.
I don't know what the numbers are,

831
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:39.390
but I'm telling you,
it's enough for Dana to talk to you.

832
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.700
You have Chad Mendez favorite in this fight.
This is the thing,

833
00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.740
Conor McGregor could knock out any man in the world and 140 because of his
power,

834
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.910
he's got some serious fucking hands,
serious fucking hands.

835
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:57.070
He throws his kicks almost disdainfully,
almost like Nick Diaz style.

836
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:02.250
And what he's doing with his kicks in a lot of ways is creating patterns to come

837
00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:06.640
in and blast you with punches.
He throws all these kicks,

838
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:10.930
like if you watch him fight Seaver,
he's throwing kicks with like minimal effort.

839
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.510
Like he's throwing them,
he smacking you with these kicks,

840
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.050
but when he lands those punches coming,

841
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.710
these punches have some serious poppy's beautiful.
What's up?

842
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.260
It is Seaver that he's doing that on.
True.
But it's also Dustin point.

843
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.410
He's throwing the same kicks.
He threw a front leg hook kick.

844
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:30.520
That was his first kick against Dustin Poirier.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a wild man and,

845
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:34.390
but the point is super confident.
Really believes is bullshit.

846
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.000
All this stuff that he's saying,
we're not here to take pause.

847
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.330
We had to take over.
I love it.
I love it.
Braveheart,

848
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.810
I love the mother fuckers smell good.
Has he been,

849
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.210
has he been wanting them to win?
I think for the UFC he would be,

850
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:49.930
if he wins this next fight,
he's the biggest star we've ever had.
He has,

851
00:48:49.931 --> 00:48:51.940
he doesn't think he's bigger than rock.
If he wins this fight,

852
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.400
because of my position,
because of what I do,

853
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.370
and I had a conversation with this guy last night.
Who are you picking?

854
00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.340
Who you're picking?
I don't pick anybody does.

855
00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.920
I'm going to tell you that you would asking you to let me know.
Say you pick,

856
00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.880
there's two.

857
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.910
There's two times maybe ever three times ever where I was hoping somebody one,

858
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.800
that's the three times that you fought fights that I call.
It's true.

859
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.170
I don't like admitting that,
but like the midstream oil and fight,
I was like,
shh.

860
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:23.410
You know the Arlovski fight.
I'm like,
ah.
I thought you got it.
And then you know,

861
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:28.840
I think it's really hard.
It's real hard when your friends fight.
Yeah.
Real,
real,

862
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:33.310
real,
real hard.
I'm friendly and I'm friends with a lot of those.

863
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:36.520
Not as cold slam with you,
but I'm friends with a lot of guys that fight.

864
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:37.870
I put that shit aside.

865
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.880
I put that shit aside and have to go into those fights like an empty objective

866
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:45.790
person.
I tried to because I've done it before.

867
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:49.440
Why I thought one guy would win and then I think maybe like flavored my,

868
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.810
my commentary that I took criticism for it and that I would listen to that

869
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:56.260
criticism and I'm a go.
I think they've got some good points,
you know?
And so I,
I,

870
00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.580
I adjusted my own approach to watching fights.
So now when I watch fights,

871
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:03.880
I watch fights with empty,
you know,

872
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:05.800
I have styles that are really like,

873
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.320
but then I like when people beat those styles.
I agree.

874
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.680
Like Anderson is my favorite style of all time.
Right.

875
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.510
A lot of watching Anderson Silva light guys up.
I mean,
come on man.

876
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:17.640
Why out of them the Chris Leben fight or the,
you know,
the Stephan Bonner fight?

877
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.010
There's only one guy in the UFC that I locked right now and I'm excited to
watch.

878
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:24.430
I gotta be honest.
And it was Connor.
That's it.
That's it.
Come on man.

879
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:28.070
I don't feel no,
I'm saying for me as far as like [inaudible] that

880
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.160
<v 0>bad ass mother fucker from Mexico,
that's a lot in the last few battle.
Calmer.</v>

881
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.510
I'm like excited.
I'm like,
I've never seen shit like this.
The way he moves,

882
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:38.240
the way he talks,
I'm like,
I haven't seen this.
Oh,
see,
I love watching him.

883
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.700
I think he's amazing.
I think he's amazing.
But I am.

884
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:42.550
I'm a high on a lot of guys right now.
Right.

885
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.940
You know that a Amir at w was Connie.

886
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.200
What the fuck's his name?
I have the fuck.
Do you say,
what do you,

887
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:53.390
what do you think of,
uh,
of um,
Wonderboy Thompson?
He,
when he moves differently,

888
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:56.130
he's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah,
he's a bad motherfucker.
Took tough fight.

889
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.080
Serious serious tracker.
Yeah.
He's tough to deal with.
Yeah,

890
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.980
he's a serious tracker.
Um,
I guess just as far as the common thing goes,

891
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:06.650
when I,
when I,
when they said it was going to be Chad Mendez,

892
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:12.340
I was on set a UFC tonight.
The rumor was,
is supposed to be Diaz Nick or Nate.

893
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.690
Nate,
Nate whites.
What?
There was that room.
Wait at that.

894
00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.760
That was the rumor on set.
Well that's a good,
that's a good sales pitch.
Yes.

895
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:22.430
100% plus both have good hands.
It's good man shop.

896
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.880
I can see Conor winning that on armor.
Connors,
that he's obese.

897
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.580
He's a bad motherfucker.
But,
but what?

898
00:51:29.581 --> 00:51:33.140
So do you think one 45 or one 45 is deep?
Do you think,

899
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.460
do you think that Jose Aldo,

900
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:36.200
and even though he's been a champion and just amazing,

901
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:41.120
do you think Josie also though in some ways it's actually an easier fight for

902
00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:45.910
Conor and is Chapman?
No.
Hell No.
Anyone says it's nobody's.
Nobody's easy.
Josie,

903
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.550
Josie,
Aldo is never easy,
but I'm just saying he was going to win that fight.

904
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:51.440
But Josie outfit is not a pressure wrestler.

905
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:54.950
The Way Chad men is going to execute.
Dan,
this is what's scary about all though.

906
00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.580
First of all,
his leg kicks are as good as anybody that's ever lived.

907
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.330
His fucking leg kicks are lightening fast and when he lands them,

908
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.020
you only have a couple of those you can take because you're diminished.

909
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:08.210
Your diminished with the first kick.
I'm telling you,
man,

910
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:12.290
I've seen guys kicked live,
although has a different kind of kick.
It's so fast.

911
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:15.330
I also think Josie is fat.
I think he's faster than Conor.
Bucky.

912
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.250
People are surprised.
Surprise.
Oh,
he's watching.
He asked me.
He's very fast.

913
00:52:19.251 --> 00:52:21.860
He's very,
very fast.
Really seen Conor is being fast.

914
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:25.670
I just see him as being in his hands.
He's very fast.
He's fast.

915
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.960
He asked for one 45 also has a great penetration on his punches.

916
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.790
He throws that left hand.
He reaches,
Ooh,
he's,
he's going through.

917
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.530
He bet he wanted to Bet Dana White,

918
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:39.610
3 million bucks and he knocks out chat in the second round.
What?
Yeah,

919
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.490
he's that confident.
See this way I was with my,
that was my next question,

920
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:43.940
but has he been,

921
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.900
Chad Mendez gets into the third round and he knocks Chad Mendez out in the third

922
00:52:47.901 --> 00:52:49.640
round and he loses three down 3 million.

923
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.620
He saw your breasts can be so depressed when they're young,
right?
Like damn.

924
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.640
Damn man,
I didn't know.
So He's been very vocal now the same way with Chapman.

925
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.920
Chapman has been laughing at him though.
And Chad Mendez is a demon.

926
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:08.200
He's a motherfucker.
You ever see Chad Mendez jump out of a fucking pool further?

927
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.160
Well,
Chad Mendez was only five foot six,
a super,

928
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:13.880
I guess a three foot side of the pool jumps out of the pool,

929
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:18.290
lands on the fucking the edge.
And then does a back flip that's so sick to me.

930
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:20.150
That's the videos.
I watch this video

931
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.970
cause I seen Bj Penn do that.
Yeah,
but not flip.
Tell

932
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:30.180
<v 2>like Chad.
Chad Mendez is a legit super half.
That's freaky.</v>

933
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:31.950
But here's something that watch this shit.

934
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:35.100
I watch this shit because this is fucking ridiculous.
Watch him standing there.

935
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.720
Watch this watch.

936
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:41.250
He's standing there by the the three foot side jumps out of the pool.

937
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.640
Boom and then does a backflip right into,
he's a monster dude.

938
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.880
Super serious athletes.
That second fight with Josie Aldo.

939
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.410
If I could make one fight and put it to to the future like lock and I'm like

940
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:56.010
watch this.
This is what the UFC is.
His second fight with Jose Aldo,

941
00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:00.120
the technique,
the back and forth re the five rounds.

942
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:04.050
It's one of the best fights in UFC history.
It was a great fight.
We'll fight man.

943
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:06.810
It was due to the wire.
What does that sound credible and

944
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.380
elite elite fighters in their prime,

945
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:16.020
a guy in Aldo who you got to think is it least top two or three pound for pound.

946
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.330
I think the number one guy in the world is mighty mouse.

947
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.150
I've said this for a while.
Just says that.
Yeah,

948
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.820
that's the best I can see that he's the best I can.
I see that.

949
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:27.150
I see that argument.
I just don't,
he's so good.

950
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:30.270
I think I have Josie Aldo over him.
I have mighty mouse too.

951
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:34.200
I've Josie don't because mighty mouse never slows down.
He says good and lazy.

952
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:39.040
Crown fucking that's true.
Pounds.
There's only 20 pounds heavier than for Pat.

953
00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:44.700
It's cut,
cut,
cut.
I think all those fighting tougher competition he already is.

954
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:47.610
But you know what?
He makes it tougher to cause he's got a different style.

955
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:48.660
I agree.
I saw,

956
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:52.080
I saw many masks walking in the Seattle airport and it was just there I was and

957
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:52.501
he kind of,

958
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:56.160
I kind of nodded at him and nodded and kept walking and nobody was giving him,

959
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:59.760
nobody even noticed him.
And I thought to myself,
that right there is,

960
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:01.830
if he was a heavyweight,
he would be just mod.
He,

961
00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.050
that's one of the baddest people on the planet at his wife.

962
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.620
Get into a club and DC was like,
Bro,

963
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:11.760
this is the world champion of the UFC.
Man.
They'd bounce was like,
okay,
go ahead.

964
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.380
They weren't going to let him into the club.

965
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.780
You don't get any land in younger love.

966
00:55:14.781 --> 00:55:17.940
You know love when you're one 25 bouncers need to fucking pay attention to the

967
00:55:17.941 --> 00:55:21.830
lower weight classes.
That ass get that ass whooped by.
Money,
mouth.

968
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.800
He'll spin around guarantee.
I guarantee fucking hard for him.

969
00:55:25.801 --> 00:55:29.410
I guarantee cause he's thick.
He's out of 25 one 25 right?
He's thick.

970
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.760
He's not a big guy,
but he's a fucking,
he's the best.
He's an elite,
elite fighter.

971
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.110
The way he moves in my opinion is like every,
if I wanted a young fighter,
I said,

972
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.900
you want to watch somebody?
You want to learn what they do.
Watch this guy.

973
00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.870
He got to get some body type.
You know what I'm saying?
With his style,

974
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.950
maybe like my fat ass when I was young,
you show me mighty mouse.
I'm like,
yeah,

975
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:51.600
no,
no,
I just can't do it.
Well,

976
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:56.601
you're carrying around boxing boxing's that way and you can't fight the way

977
00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:59.990
Floyd Mayweather or are right.

978
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:04.500
John is doing junior fights without having a lot of that ability to just st

979
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.000
speech.
Two words for you.
Mohammed Ali,
true.
He Muhammad Ali,

980
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:12.600
when he's losing his mind,
he had that kind of body,
but when he was in his time,

981
00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:17.550
he was 220 pounds.
His physical,
his physicality,

982
00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:21.180
he's such an athlete.
His,
he had all,
he was the way he would hit.

983
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:24.040
When you watch him as Cassius clay,
he moved like a little man.
He was

984
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.670
<v 0>so fast and smooth and that that's really hard for it.</v>

985
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:31.180
That's a very rare example of a huge guy who moved like a small guy.

986
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:33.520
You don't have to be physically.
I was wearing a brutal fight.

987
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:37.000
I said Cassius Clay's shirt.
I got one of those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Love it.
Right.

988
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:39.650
It's the white ones is like my wardrobe was me to fight.
Me Too.

989
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.310
Sometimes I feel like an asshole.

990
00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:45.310
This is wearing my white shirts all the time because I'm in line at a Starbucks.

991
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.440
This old white dude comes up to me.
He goes,
hey man,
that's shirts.

992
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:53.440
Offensive went what?
He was at shirts offensive I to,

993
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.540
I forgot what I was wearing.
I looked down,
I'm like,

994
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:59.350
what the fuck is he talking about?
And he goes,
that that,
that was a slave name.

995
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.440
I was like,
okay,
cool man.
Have a good day.
He's like that shirts.

996
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.860
I wouldn't wear that man.
I was like,
Bro,
beat it.
Nerd.

997
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:09.910
I didn't make the fucking shirt.
I'm some Mohamad Ali fan.
It's old school.

998
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.370
It's historical represents,

999
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:15.020
it's got fifth street gym in Miami on the patch as well.

1000
00:57:15.021 --> 00:57:17.770
He changed his name when he converted to Islam.
Well not only that,

1001
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.370
he is getting proceeds from that shirt like yeah,
authorize the sale.

1002
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:25.450
That shirt was that.
Sure,
of course is who he was when he fought in the Olympics.

1003
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.170
How the shirts in your coffee.
How about pitching that dark roast?

1004
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.410
He won a gold medal,
which he threw into the St Louis River.
I believe.

1005
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:37.240
God Damn White people.
White people,
man.
Fucking white people.

1006
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.553
Fucking like.

1007
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.920
I've been working on this pit about how I secretly roof black people.

1008
00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:45.190
Like if I see a black homeless guy versus a white homeless guy,
I'm always like,

1009
00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.130
you know what man,
you probably accused of a crime he didn't commit.

1010
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:51.160
Hey go and I see a white guy.
I'm like,
wash your face and wear some glasses.

1011
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.470
Well let's keep going.
I want to work on that.
But anyways,

1012
00:57:56.170 --> 00:58:00.880
anyways,
cough your guys.
Hey,
that's not that big.
You asshole.
Hey,
Hey,

1013
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:03.820
speaking of shitty thing now on speaking of shitty things,

1014
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:07.560
how about Travis Browne?
Oh boy.
Hold.
Yeah,

1015
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:12.520
hold awkward.
UFC sets that you'll see at fight week said,

1016
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.940
hey listen,
we can't have you signing and hidden bitches,

1017
00:58:15.941 --> 00:58:19.030
so we're going to have you sit this one out.
Okay,
so what is going on with him?

1018
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.410
His wife,
his former fiance or wife or fiance,
right?

1019
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:28.720
Instagram.
Just bully,
beat downs.
Black Guy,
horrible bruises.

1020
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.310
Said her leg.
Everything said I'm sick of this.
I don't want,

1021
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.160
I can't believe I stuck through it through this long.
Uh,
you know,
physical abuse,

1022
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:39.760
domestic abuse is nothing to,
you know,
not a laughing matter,
whatever.

1023
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.790
Post an Instagram picture and it's horrible.
If you guys have seen,
it's horrible.

1024
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:44.410
It's interesting.
This is not on the underground.

1025
00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.880
I could sign on the front page where all the news is to try and keep the UFC

1026
00:58:48.881 --> 00:58:53.440
fricking be yanked him from the this fight week.
Hey Dave.
Oh yeah.

1027
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.320
How about Brandy Palmer?
Brittany Palmer is fucking husband gets to go.

1028
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:03.370
He gets $10 bought,
tempted murder,
attempted murder.
He tried to choke her,

1029
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.700
first of all,
his Jujitsu so weak because if I'm going to,

1030
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.480
I'm really attempting to choke her.
She said mean.
That's what I said.

1031
00:59:09.481 --> 00:59:12.690
I'll tell you what real attempted murder.
That's what I said.
How is she alive?

1032
00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:16.600
The choke is she can Ken shamrock.
What's going on here?

1033
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.980
I'll tell you what though,
with just with Travis Brown,
when saw that,
when I

1034
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.980
<v 2>saw this girl all beat up was like,
I,
I feel you man.
He whipped my ass.</v>

1035
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.880
I was like,
girl,
go for a take down.
Go,
go,

1036
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.810
go.
For Jujitsu.
I mean how?
How he slapped the shit out of me too.

1037
00:59:34.811 --> 00:59:39.811
I feel he slapped up this out of me so I feel like reaching out to and be like,

1038
00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:44.480
you want to talk about it?
He'd beat the shit out of me.

1039
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:47.420
At least is front of millions of people that you are alone.

1040
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.050
I was in my underwear.
We beat the fuck out of me.
I don't fight anymore.

1041
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:55.820
And you want to talk about it?
Do you,
do you think?

1042
00:59:55.970 --> 01:00:00.590
I mean when you see a girl like Brittany who's,
she's a nice kid,
man.

1043
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.530
I mean I don't understand it.
I just don't understand smoking.

1044
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.580
She smoked apparently he forced her and again,
a bunch of plastic surgeries to,

1045
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:10.170
that's what she's also saying and it was like the reason why she had all their

1046
01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:14.810
work done.
The rich kid who was handed money and moved to La,
you know,

1047
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.700
they kids in hand doesn't,
it doesn't work out.
That's what I've heard.

1048
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.670
That's what I've heard.
I don't know where he earned his plane.

1049
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.000
I always got along with the guy.
He's always cool to me.

1050
01:00:23.001 --> 01:00:25.800
I enjoy talking to him when he was with her.
I mean I really,

1051
01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.350
I mean I hate saying it now because I know I allegedly know what he did so and I

1052
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:31.730
hate him at,
you know,

1053
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.810
fundamentally is one thing I will play with men like her man.
She's too,

1054
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:38.990
I really like every time I talked to she's Sassy.
She's always fun.

1055
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:43.300
When was joking?
She's one of the rear girls in the octagon,
which you know,

1056
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.910
she has a talent and it's a painting.
If you've seen their dope man,

1057
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.980
she's a good about reaching out and having her paint some shit.

1058
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:52.420
A big brown putting up my house.
Oh,
she'd be happy to do.
Yeah,
she's super legit.

1059
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:55.860
She has been.
So it's been like a right like a down to earth.
She's fine.

1060
01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.550
I like hanging out with her.
She's coming with some of my shows.

1061
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.600
I love looking at Instagram late at night.

1062
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:08.460
She's married.
Not Anymore.
Slip official.

1063
01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.430
Lead divorced too.
He,
he's out on $1 million bail.
1 million.

1064
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:18.950
It's a weird night shit.
But,
but hear me out.
No Shit.
You hear me out on this?

1065
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:23.060
Hear me out of here we go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1066
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.380
Hit me up man.
Cause you guys,
it wasn't dented.
No,

1067
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:29.960
but I'm giving them Jujitsu lessons at force or heard of this up but,

1068
01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:33.020
but since we don't really know the details,
when I hear,

1069
01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.140
when I hear that it was attempted murder the problem and he had choked her like

1070
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:43.350
there is the question of she got out like she got away.
What?

1071
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.010
What are the circumstances?
Like for me,
I'm always guarded about this.

1072
01:01:46.011 --> 01:01:49.380
I want to hear more about the case where I can then I don't know what I do.
I go,

1073
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.680
Oh you put your hands on her.
Done.
Yeah,
it's done.

1074
01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.450
What do you mean he wants to fucking tears.
Here's

1075
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.890
what happened.
Listen,
here's the,
you're fucking man.
Okay,

1076
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.030
here's the only time it's okay to hit a woman,
which he's trying to kill you.

1077
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.890
She's got a knife and she's trying to kill you.

1078
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.890
You're saving your life and you hit her across what was happening.

1079
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.370
We don't get to hurt that.
You would have heard that it would come out.

1080
01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:15.710
He would've said that he hasn't said anything like that.

1081
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:16.730
There's no evidence and won't be.

1082
01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:18.050
That's because his lawyers are telling him not to.

1083
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.840
<v 0>Hillary dollar bond.
Britney Palmer's not trying to stab anybody.</v>

1084
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.000
I might be wrong.
You're right.
You're right.
I don't know.

1085
01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:29.960
I'm just saying we're talking.
No,
no.
Fuck that.
Fuck you might.

1086
01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.670
I don't know you right.
I don't know,
but does not match.

1087
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.160
That's the only possibility is that she's coming at him with a knife or a gun.

1088
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.590
She's trying to kill like Chris Brown and Rihanna.
They're like,
yeah,

1089
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:43.850
we'll Rihanna did some shit.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't care this that.

1090
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.740
She did do that,
but girl,
I love punched me in the face.

1091
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:50.010
I'm going to be very upset.
I'm not punching it back right now.

1092
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:53.130
My whole error.

1093
01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:58.740
Let me take some heat for this.
I'm just kidding.
No,

1094
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:02.880
I would never touch her solar plexus.
I grab her ass.

1095
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.590
I would never hit her.
I wouldn't.

1096
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.060
I would put her in the tightest Anaconda Josie ever seen?
No,
never.

1097
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:10.560
I've never choked anybody,

1098
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:14.040
but I did take my wife's back once and I put the body triangle on it just to let

1099
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:17.500
her know what's up.
Obviously naked.
It's fun.
I had,

1100
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.010
I had a girl

1101
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.700
ever,
I had a girlfriend who would get drunk and get jealous and hit me.

1102
01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.260
She tried to take my hat off with a boot.
Did you marry her?
Nope.
Get clothes.

1103
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.010
I don't to talk about it,
but my buddy,

1104
01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:41.370
we were at a party and it was all great and she was kind of person who would get

1105
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:43.290
drunk and you wouldn't know it.
And,

1106
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:48.270
and my buddy was there and he said,
I saw,

1107
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.630
he said he saw the whole thing and this is where I'm just,
let me hear me out.

1108
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:52.680
Cause I,
she,

1109
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.640
she thought I was looking at a friend who was there and my party a girl and she

1110
01:03:56.641 --> 01:03:58.200
just attacked me physically.

1111
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.850
And I countered by getting her an under hooks or something.

1112
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:07.980
And I kind of hip tossed her away from me.
And we both crash through a window,

1113
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.720
not a window,
but a adjoining doors,
you know,
those French doors.

1114
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.360
And my buddy's side,
the whole fucking thing.
Glass.
Yes.
So my glass everywhere,

1115
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:22.200
glass everywhere and the door broke.
That's assault brother.
Well,
hold on.

1116
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:26.070
My buddy saw the whole thing from its inception.
He saw her attack me.

1117
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.350
Somebody else saw only me hip tossing her through the,

1118
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.900
well,
kind of not really hip hop with getting her away from me and she,

1119
01:04:34.901 --> 01:04:38.820
he's taught me to hit does her through the glass.
If that person that saw that,

1120
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:42.270
it looked like I was thrown us through fucking doors.
I wasn't,

1121
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.420
here's the raw buddy came to my defense and said,
just so you know,

1122
01:04:45.421 --> 01:04:46.800
I saw the whole fucking thing.

1123
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:50.340
I saw her jump on you and attack you and you were trying to get her away and

1124
01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:53.970
calm her down.
And I,
and then I brought her,
I put her,

1125
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:56.370
I brought her because there was a party into my garage,

1126
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.650
held it down and said calm down.

1127
01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:02.340
And I was holding her physically down physically so she couldn't move and she

1128
01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:07.341
was screaming dapping you can sit a lot of things and you're saying if I'm a cop

1129
01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:09.400
and like,
hey,
that's kidnapped.
That's what I mean.

1130
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.400
I could get arrested for assault when what I was doing was doing what I was

1131
01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:15.960
trying to protect myself by holding her down.

1132
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.760
I was trying not to quit embarrassing situation

1133
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.750
<v 2>and I was trying to like sort of extinguished the problem.
Here's one for you.</v>

1134
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.090
What do you do?
What do you do that?
See what's that?

1135
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.350
What do you do if you're the UFC?

1136
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:29.680
They actually suspend them for just for UFC fight week.
Makes Sense.

1137
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:31.220
We're not talking about Brittany anymore.
We're talking about,

1138
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:32.170
you're talking about Charles Brown.

1139
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.470
I'm just talking about also sometimes as we all know,

1140
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:39.100
you can get in a situation where it's like,
just that example,

1141
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.670
I could have been if somebody had seen a segment of that and I for sure.

1142
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:46.840
Let's get it fun.
Okay,
well let's talk about reality.
Okay.

1143
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.850
If he did beat her,
okay.
If he did and he did more than once.
Yeah.

1144
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:54.400
You got to cut them of course.
Right?
You got to cut it.
Yes,

1145
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.810
and that's what they did with rumble Johnson and then they found out were
rumble.

1146
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.820
Johnson was a lot of bullshit.

1147
01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:00.640
It was his baby mama and it was a lot of nonsense and it wasn't real.

1148
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:02.380
He didn't have these pictures.
There's exactly,

1149
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:06.040
but there's also women that we'll pretend now I have a friend and he was

1150
01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:08.680
breaking up with his girlfriend and she said,

1151
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:12.040
and he recorded it and she started saying things like,
you know,

1152
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.840
I'm going to tell the police you,
you hit me,

1153
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:16.810
I'm gonna throw myself down a flight of stairs.
All this kind of crazy shit.

1154
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.610
I had it done to me.
It happens.
Yes,
it does happen.
The windows and said,

1155
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.850
stop hitting me.
Starts screaming.
It's not like,
I think that's the exception.

1156
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.080
I gotta be honest.
I don't know about that.
And you don't know.

1157
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.170
It may be the exception,
but less elite girl hit her.

1158
01:06:30.171 --> 01:06:34.690
How about you back off?
Know there are people that are deceptive.

1159
01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.220
Dissolve.
There are people mean God girl.
Yes,
it's,
it's possible.
It's possible.

1160
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.610
It might not.
Whether it's the exception and not,
it's not the point.

1161
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.490
Like is it possible?
Yes.
Does it happen?
Yes.

1162
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.070
So at that time I friend who was accused of rape,

1163
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.210
but he kept all the text messages and show the prosecutor,
well,

1164
01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:52.810
how am I gonna fucking guy in Virginia?

1165
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.030
The guy with the girls walking around with a mattress on her back.

1166
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.050
He's got text messages from her asking him to come over and fuck around that.

1167
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.070
But yeah,
it's tough.
Yeah.

1168
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.360
I mean that's why we have courts and that's why we have due process and that's

1169
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:07.450
why in this country you're,
you're innocent until proven guilty.

1170
01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:10.810
It's called Habeas Corpus.
I'll tell you who I think,
but we're not,
you're,
you're,

1171
01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.350
you're guilty mail to the public a pants.
What I mean and that Travis is guilty.

1172
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:18.550
You look at it in scam.
The comments are tough.
Yeah,
look,
that's it.

1173
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:22.090
That might be it.
Public jumps on it right away.
If he really did do that,

1174
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:25.600
he is guilty.
Right?
We all agree.
Yes.
Okay.
If he really did beat her up,

1175
01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:27.100
we all agree it's got be cost.
Right.

1176
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:31.750
You think UFC cuts him and then he goes to host tore and just dominate.
Listen,

1177
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.780
I think he goes to jail.
Yeah.
I mean if you really did beat her up,

1178
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:38.060
he goes to jail.
Right half too.
It's just salt.
So salt brothers,

1179
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:42.490
especially with a really PR,
she's beautiful.
She is smart.
She has legit bruises.

1180
01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:46.420
I mean he is there.
Harvey is huge.
He's a g so big giant man.

1181
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.290
When he came and knocked down,
I was like,
Jesus Christ.
I can imagine her.

1182
01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.120
He jumped down the whole bro.
Yeah,
I mean the same way.

1183
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:59.290
We obviously don't know what the fuck happened.
We don't know.
We have no idea.

1184
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.560
I mean we could,
it could be another,
I'll throw myself down the flight of stairs.

1185
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.430
I always take the girl's side on this.
Well,
it's the smart thing to take.
I mean,

1186
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:08.140
she's the victim.
If it is,
I mean,

1187
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:11.560
the worst thing you could do is question someone who's been victimized and we

1188
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:16.010
may,
I don't know what really happened is fucked up,
right?
Yeah.
And for the most

1189
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.820
<v 0>part,
I think that when,
if my,
I have to believe,
and I,
it's just,</v>

1190
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:22.550
I don't know this person.
I don't know Travis.
I don't know the situation,

1191
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:26.870
but I do feel like,
you know,
when you post pictures like that to Instagram,

1192
01:08:26.871 --> 01:08:30.260
I feel like this is definitely not the first time he's been hitting her and

1193
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.800
she's finally had enough and decided,
yeah,

1194
01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.030
this is the only way I can purchase that.

1195
01:08:35.031 --> 01:08:38.540
She was embarrassed that she waited so long ago,
man.
And with a girl like that,

1196
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:41.720
I mean this is the only time in human history with someone who's been able to do

1197
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:43.580
something like that.
I take a photo,

1198
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:46.720
put that photo on your Instagram and instant power.
Instagram.

1199
01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:49.420
There are a lot of countries right now in this code,

1200
01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:52.220
in this world where you as a wife,
if you're getting the shit beat out of you,

1201
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:54.860
there are no laws that protect you.
Travis needs to move there.
Yeah.

1202
01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:58.480
It's a good spot for him.
If that's,
if that's his thing,
take her house there.

1203
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.510
Yeah.
I don't,
you know,
tough.
It makes me,
when I,

1204
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:06.140
when I hear like this Aaron Guy and Brittany,
I'd like the guy,
I mean,
I,
you know,

1205
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:09.280
I talked to him,
I enjoyed talking to him.
He said,
was he perfect person?
No,

1206
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.650
but obviously I wasn't in a relationship with them and I w I don't know what the

1207
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:16.280
fuck happened,
which we don't know.
We don't know and I need to hear is okay.

1208
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.670
You beat her.
You choked her.
Cool.
Not My friend.

1209
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.670
Don't talk to me when we see each other.
That's really what happened.

1210
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:27.530
It's Brittany call me and it's very sad.
Try Brittany.

1211
01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:31.020
I am available seven Tuesdays.
Yeah.

1212
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:36.320
Ulterior motive.
You somehow if you need to play stay.
I live in Marina village.

1213
01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:39.860
No,
but it's not like that man.
It's fucked up.
People get to that place.

1214
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:42.020
It's fucked.
The people that used to be in love,

1215
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:45.260
they were lucky enough to get married and they had a big crazy wedding.

1216
01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:48.680
They held this hand.
We know one thing.
It's a fine line between love and hate,

1217
01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:50.270
man.
If there's one thing,

1218
01:09:50.271 --> 01:09:53.240
and they always say like the most dangerous place for a woman sometimes or even

1219
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:57.080
a man is the bedroom.
Shit flares.
Fucking tempers.

1220
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:01.640
Cops fucking hate going to domestic violence to someone always has to be

1221
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:03.860
arrested if it domestic violence is called.

1222
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.380
They didn't have to rest someone every time.
Smart.

1223
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.990
My buddy off and also he said the worst case if it's two gay guys,

1224
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.010
because gay guys think about gay dudes fight like dudes.

1225
01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:21.050
They know about this.
A scrap scrap or that Dick.

1226
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.630
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.
I don't know if this is true.

1227
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.580
I think about it bro.
That's true.
And I don't know if this is true,

1228
01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:31.880
but I heard from a cop who did a lot of a detective.
They said,
well,

1229
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.090
well you get a lot of face stabbings in the gay community.
And I was like,

1230
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:36.860
what do you mean?
He goes,
when lovers fight,
man,

1231
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:40.040
you can usually tell if somebody knew the other person and hat was physical with

1232
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:43.040
them,
like in love with them and physically,
you know,
sexually physical.

1233
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.840
If their faces are,
they have 15 fucking stab with great white sharks.

1234
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.570
Very.
That's very typical of somebody who hates like,

1235
01:10:50.571 --> 01:10:53.660
I loved you and now I fucking hate you.
I'm a stab your fucking ruin that face.

1236
01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:55.890
I'll try and ruin that.
I was gay.
Oh Gosh.

1237
01:10:55.970 --> 01:11:00.320
I got to go back to the Dick guys like a little scar.
No,
I get that booty hole

1238
01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:06.500
right.
Hey man,
you gotta stab the booty.
Oh,
come on.

1239
01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:09.680
Stop someone in the booty hole.
You could get the toxic in the blood.

1240
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:14.010
Then we heard evil son and you know you might have to wear a colostomy bag

1241
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.300
<v 2>or something while anywhere.
Anywhere Sucks at Dick.
Could it be?</v>

1242
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:20.130
I'd probably get shot.
If you had to be standing somewhere,
where would it be?

1243
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.120
One place you have to choose.
Go and stab me in this juicy quad.

1244
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:27.600
So know you could die.
Fuck.
Big fucking arteries.
Femoral artery.

1245
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.800
Now I'll take my chances.
If you think about it,

1246
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:36.510
the quad for our forum.
Go Form Stab my forms of your hand.

1247
01:11:36.511 --> 01:11:40.050
Might get fucking separate nerve go Kimbo slice.

1248
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:42.840
Kimbo slice told me if you ever get in a knife fight you,

1249
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:47.490
you let them cut outside.
So Kimbo Kimbo had all these fucking cuts all over.

1250
01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.270
All right,
fuck it.
Let's talk about this for a minute.

1251
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.660
How crazy is it that we talk about fights?
Like,
you know,

1252
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:56.260
we're just a bunch of dudes sitting around and talking.

1253
01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:01.260
Then it becomes new stories.
I know the MMA media is so bizarre.

1254
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:02.760
Like we talked shit about that.

1255
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:07.170
Ken shamrock Kimbo fight that became a giant fucking news story.

1256
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.080
You had rex feelings.
He's like,
Joe Rogan shouldn't do that now I do that.

1257
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:15.230
Yeah,
well,
well,
you're a powerful dude.
My man.
You know what I,

1258
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.500
what I've learned on pack podcasts in two is,
you know,
I joke around,

1259
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.680
I make stuff fine,
but then boom,
it's a headline like,
shit,

1260
01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:25.140
I better watch what I say a little bit when you joke around.

1261
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:28.890
Also there's a difference between listened to you talk in context of a full

1262
01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:31.290
conversation,
whereas a lot of shit talking and laughing,

1263
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:35.740
taking it and printing it.
When it's two dimensional,
it's on paper.
Like,

1264
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:40.440
like Fox in an article where Brian asked me on one of our podcasts,
he goes,
well,

1265
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.230
how do you think Connor's feeling right now?
I went,
Oh,
I'm sure he's terrified.

1266
01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:48.270
You know,
like the anxiety of fighting,
they change your opponent 12 days.

1267
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:51.000
It's completely different style.
You're fighting a wrestler.

1268
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.010
There's some nerves there,
man.
I bet he's terrified.

1269
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.310
He's not gonna win or he doesn't believe himself.
Just naturally,

1270
01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.640
everyone's terrified to fight,
man.
What's our brand shop things?

1271
01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:04.560
Connor's terrified and then its fans fucking just reach out to me like they want

1272
01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:07.360
to fucking Travis Browne.
Yeah,
just fun.

1273
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:12.350
10 fucking Brittany Palmer,
you know,
it's like brutal man.
So,

1274
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.800
so then when you,
it's almost like now I don't censor myself,

1275
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.390
but you can tell people get careful.
You can see how people get very sort of a,

1276
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:24.180
an antiseptic and very sort of sanitized.

1277
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.770
What was weird was what articles are being written while the podcast was going

1278
01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.770
on,
so people were sitting in front of their computer

1279
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:37.500
ready.
Joe Rody.
Soon as we were talking about the Cam Sharmarke fight,

1280
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:40.730
it was in podcast order in,
in articles routed.
You get Rick,

1281
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.130
did anybody reach out to you about that,
Ken or anybody?
I'm no,
look,
look,

1282
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:46.890
I love Ken shamrock.
I'm a huge the fan,

1283
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:49.890
and that's one of the reasons why I was suspicious about him not being able to

1284
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:52.440
finish that rear naked choke underneath the neck,

1285
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.630
underneath the neck on anybody with a fresh Ken shamrock.
Yes.
But I guess,

1286
01:13:57.631 --> 01:14:01.830
you know,
you have a good point that he's 51 and you know,
I mean,
look,
Kim is not,

1287
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.010
he's not a joke,
but his ground game,
so he's been the weakest part of his game.

1288
01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.830
There's a,
there's a lot of issues with that fight that a lot of people have,

1289
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.070
but the big issue was there were fights and Ken's passed and were worked.

1290
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.550
Jack Slack did a piece on it.
Yeah,
the history of it.
Yeah.

1291
01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:18.460
So you're not breaking any news.
I'm not black breaking news.

1292
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.340
Jack Slack was one of the best writers in MMA today.

1293
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:24.670
He's a fucking fantastic at breaking down fights.
He did,

1294
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.550
I think it was called the anatomy of a fixed fight.
And he did,

1295
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.630
he showed fights from pancreas that what?
You watched them and you go,
oh,
okay,

1296
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:33.550
that's worked for knocky fi,

1297
01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.380
but would it be Joe Rogan,
huge.
Ken shamrock supportive.

1298
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:40.510
They're not going to write that.
Maybe,
maybe they would,

1299
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:43.300
but they just sit there and wait for something.
Shop Talk Shit about

1300
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.600
that position that he had him in is maybe the hardest thing to get out of in
the,

1301
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.010
on the planet when you got,

1302
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:54.700
when you got us back underneath like that on top of them do just got good

1303
01:14:54.701 --> 01:14:57.430
Jujitsu.
No,
you know,
like there's a lot of guys,
you get their back.

1304
01:14:57.431 --> 01:15:00.940
Like John Fitch was notorious for like you could get his back and choke him and

1305
01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:03.440
he figured out a way out of it.
Remember with Eric Silva,

1306
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:07.750
Silva had a deep choke on them and he's like,
whatever high level guys,
but let's,

1307
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.310
let's get,
let's not get twisted.

1308
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:11.820
Kimbo slice isn't winning any [inaudible] who competition.

1309
01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:16.740
So I gets a little suspect.
It's a little suspect,
you know,
but it's just,

1310
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:21.430
I think that Ken is,
he,
he's in an unfavorable position.

1311
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:23.740
First of all,
he's a real legend of MMA.

1312
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:25.480
He's one of the guys that started it all off.

1313
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:30.540
If it was for Ken shamrock and his fights like Ken shamrock was huge back in the

1314
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:34.840
day.
Then right before the pancreas.

1315
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.040
Rushmore of MMA.
Yeah,

1316
01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:42.060
he's in there 100% so and also he created the lion's den and help guys like Pete

1317
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.660
Williams get them out of there.
Yeah,

1318
01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:47.650
there was a lot of great fighters that came out of there and that whole 20

1319
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:51.400
Galendo there was a whole like group of guys that came up in that era,

1320
01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:55.240
you know that w that wound up being like really big fighters and a lot of it was

1321
01:15:55.241 --> 01:15:58.240
under his tutelage.
It's just the Games is very different now.
Fights,

1322
01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.500
fights are very different.

1323
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.220
You're dealing with the John Jones's of the world now you're dealing with a
year.

1324
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:07.630
Rodriguez is,
the game has moved.
It's a different thing.
And you know,

1325
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.240
Ken is not financially secure.
You know,

1326
01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:13.300
he's not a multi multimillionaire like he should be.
Right.
You know,

1327
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:17.090
if he was as a pioneer.
Yeah.
If he was a pioneer in any other sport,

1328
01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:19.240
if he's a partner as a NASCAR driver,

1329
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:23.080
if he's a pioneer in basketball or anything that he would be set for life.

1330
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.860
You're living in a mansion,
drinking Martinis by the pool club on NBC.

1331
01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:27.790
Wild World of sports,

1332
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:31.180
talking about fights that are upcoming and treated with the respect that he

1333
01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:31.900
deserves,

1334
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.530
but he's in this unfavorable position where he's got to fight at 51 years old.

1335
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:37.330
And one thing that I'd like to,
he said he's,

1336
01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:40.540
I've earned the right to fight for fun,
and if that's what he's doing,

1337
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.980
if that's what he wants to do,
I'm 100% down with degree.

1338
01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.750
Look at a guy like Mark Coleman to man.
He's not doing another pioneer.
Exactly.

1339
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:51.040
He's all fucked up for a second hip surgery coming up.
And again,

1340
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.670
massive mark homophobia.
I love him as a human being,
man.

1341
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.660
Legends.
Oh,
eight shop could do what you're doing,

1342
01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:01.930
making a lot of money and go be like those guys though.
Yeah,
it's too hard,
man.

1343
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.780
But you're a different guy because you're funny and you've got to,

1344
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:09.100
you got to have a fun personality and you,
you translated perfectly into,

1345
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:12.970
and you're lucky,
you know Brian Cowen,
but without those,
the Joe Rogan.
Yeah.

1346
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:16.730
Without those things,
it's like,
it's hard for these dudes.
Like a guy like Brian.

1347
01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:19.600
Stan I think has a real future in podcasting because he's,

1348
01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:23.180
he's brilliant and he's very articulate.
He's very smart.
Like Brian.

1349
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:28.130
Stan is a smart,
sharp mother.
Really sharp dude.
Sharpe shames me with his,

1350
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.250
with his,
I dunno.
Jolynne just his character.
It can be president.

1351
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:36.020
I know for him to eat,
I'd vote for him in a heart to him till he was like,
Hey,

1352
01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:40.190
a lot of fighters I know love the Reebok deal.
When I saw that I was like,
oh,

1353
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:43.670
you hurt my feelings Stan.
Stan.

1354
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:46.310
I thought we were bullying and,
and then I'm like,
whatever.

1355
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:49.760
I get over that and I see seal chill zone and this Reebok deals.
Amazing.

1356
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.820
Sonia said the same thing.
Oh No,
they got,

1357
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:58.370
well they made good livings shot too.
They got to you.
The shirts are good looking

1358
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.693
pause.

1359
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.970
Just a very quiet,

1360
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:10.440
you just hear a dog barking.
Well get blurred.

1361
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.800
Melendez Gilbert,
give blurt blue.
Spell the spell.
His name alert.

1362
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.390
They spelled a bunch of people's names wrong.
I mean,
how do you do that?

1363
01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.310
Check crazy.
They don't care.
It's not their world.
MMA is not their world,

1364
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.150
not the world.
They didn't care the world.
Yeah.
It's,
you know,

1365
01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:29.310
it's no big deal.
I don't want you to do,

1366
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:32.460
I think it sucks for the fighters that that can't make as much money because I

1367
01:18:32.461 --> 01:18:36.030
think that it's a fucking,
it's a hard road.
I mean,

1368
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.130
to try to make them as it is hard,

1369
01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:40.720
hard enough as it is and now just got way harder.
Yeah.

1370
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.860
It just got way harder for a lot of guys would I hope is that there's another

1371
01:18:43.861 --> 01:18:47.010
revenue stream that they haven't figured out.
I hope this was a shining.

1372
01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:51.900
It's there for over lining.
The silver lining is don't have Reebok in the UFC.

1373
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:55.200
Tell your story.
If Amaa,
and we've talked about this before on here,

1374
01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.490
if I'm a guy like,
uh,
Chad Mendez,
I'm having tee-shirts sprint and I'm saying,

1375
01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:03.960
this is my official shirt champions shirt.
I get 100% of the proceeds.
Right.

1376
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:06.870
Instead of buying this bullshit,
Reebok shoot for $95,

1377
01:19:06.871 --> 01:19:10.980
which I have nothing to do with.
It's horrible.
Come on dude.
That's so expensive.

1378
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:15.030
Yeah.
Go to go to Chad and whatever he has Chad mendez.com and buy this shirt.

1379
01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:18.120
This is what supports me.
This is shirt that I created.
Reebok,

1380
01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:22.500
we have no creative authority.
What I was thinking is like,
you know how fighters,

1381
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.890
like one of my favorite things to watch up up to fights when I get really hyped

1382
01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:29.960
up.
So I watch all their videos.
They're putting up of training footage,

1383
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:33.270
all this different Shit I get.
I'm like,
if you had like organize shit,

1384
01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.910
like if camps put together Oregon and like some guys do,

1385
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:38.120
you know like Mcgregor's done psalm and,

1386
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:42.270
and some guys like we'll have cameras follow them around and training and those

1387
01:19:42.271 --> 01:19:45.600
can get a lot of hits.
Oh these fucking things.
Get a lot of money off that.

1388
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:49.810
Now think if you're wearing a shirt that you approve and you design your winning

1389
01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.080
all those vignettes,
what I'm saying going to jump on.

1390
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:56.160
Say you have a training video and it's all like torque one.

1391
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:58.680
You know your rise company,
my opinion,

1392
01:19:58.681 --> 01:20:02.560
the best fucking gloves between them and Higher Bussa Ohio boost has got higher.

1393
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:07.110
Bussa has the best fucking tie pads.
Yeah,
they're fucking tie pads are so good.

1394
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:10.110
My trainer Justin,
his arms are so fucked up.

1395
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.250
I would make his arms go numb and his,
his elbows,
he would get these spikes up.

1396
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:17.840
His elbows is whack because he's holding regular tie pads.

1397
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:22.260
Fucked his forearms up.
But these higher Bussa ones,
dude,
full blast,

1398
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.680
full Renaud products him,
he could take them cause they're super thick.

1399
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:29.190
They're super thick and they're all this high tech foam shit and they absorb the

1400
01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:32.070
shot.
I mean you probably wouldn't want to hold pads for Pedro his own,

1401
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.100
but he could,
he could take my kicks.

1402
01:20:34.101 --> 01:20:38.220
So have high Bussa Pay Chad Mendez to have those in this video.
Exactly.

1403
01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:38.881
But that's what I'm saying.

1404
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:41.700
Like maybe there's a revenue stream that they haven't tapped into.

1405
01:20:41.701 --> 01:20:44.920
Maybe there's like something like that.
Make your own shit out of way.

1406
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.490
Make your own shit is good too.
I like that idea.

1407
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.660
I was on set of a major hit podcast.
You guys are the fighter and the kid,

1408
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:53.850
like I told you when,
when I did Brian's,
um,

1409
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:58.200
for the taping of Brian standup special,
and I came to that show and I was like,

1410
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:00.940
oh,
it was just see a fighter in the kitchen about,

1411
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.640
we were in San Francisco and I said,

1412
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:06.900
any fighter and get fans sold out every show.
I went,
oh my God,

1413
01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:09.360
this is the boiling point.
Now it's starting to happen.
I get that.

1414
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:11.250
And you can say,
well,
you have a pocket sell shirts,

1415
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:13.680
but a guy like Conor McGregor,
Ronda Rousey,

1416
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:18.100
you can have your own shit instead of having Reebok's.
Yes,
I agree.

1417
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:19.110
It just doesn't make sense to me.

1418
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.650
I was on set of eyes is the UFC now or you'll see a night,

1419
01:21:21.651 --> 01:21:24.030
and I was talking to guy,
I'm not gonna say his name.
And I go,
Bro,

1420
01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.900
why would you have your fans pay $95 for this Reebok shoe?
Do you like it?

1421
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:31.710
He goes,
no.
I said,
and you retweeted it and instagrammed it.
That's weird to me.

1422
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:36.210
Just have someone.
If your managers tell you this,
they trying to play ball.

1423
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:38.310
They're trying to play ball.
They're trying to be a good God.

1424
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.510
They're trying to be a company person,

1425
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.900
so the only option they think they only have one option.

1426
01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.560
Not though because if you want to play ball,

1427
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:46.860
you know what happens at the end of the ballgame.
You're left with no money.

1428
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:51.540
Do your own revenue shit man.
They think that if they play ball along the way,

1429
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:54.720
they'll get more bonuses,
there'll be favored,
they'll get more,

1430
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:55.950
they're getting better deals.

1431
01:21:55.951 --> 01:21:59.220
The UFC and the UFC does take care of people they'd like and people that work

1432
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:02.910
with them,
they do give out bonuses.
They do.
There's a good deal to that.
Why?

1433
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:05.000
Why depend on that trend on that?

1434
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:07.440
You can create your own signature shirt man and you,

1435
01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:08.870
you smart motherfucker businessman.

1436
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:12.260
We should start teaching seminars to fighters about how to,

1437
01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:15.600
like you should ask some ice optimize their ability there.
But again,

1438
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:19.740
when you have that,
they don't as you're funny,
you know,
if a guy's not funny,

1439
01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:24.000
it's going to be real hard to push a podcast unless you're real sharp guy like

1440
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:26.310
Stan,
forget the podcast.
What you just said is interesting.

1441
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:28.720
Like if you had cameras following you around and you and,

1442
01:22:28.721 --> 01:22:31.770
and they're capturing all the ins and outs of your training and be honest,

1443
01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:32.241
like show that,

1444
01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:35.610
look where you feels like shitty or you feel great and all the relationships

1445
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:39.390
you're trying to deal with.
And at the same time you've got product placement,

1446
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.480
which is just I use,
hi Bruce,
how are I use this kind of stuff.

1447
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.700
You can make money that way.
You can make money,

1448
01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:48.300
but it's a lot more top tier and it's also a lot of productions extra stuff to

1449
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:52.320
think about.
It used to be,
you put that fucking,
what does it fastener,

1450
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:53.180
what's it called?
Dynamic.

1451
01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.180
Yet you can it that across your deck and you're making 20 grand.

1452
01:22:57.181 --> 01:23:00.110
You know what I mean?
It's like they had the shirts on.
Okay,

1453
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.880
now we got to do a different route.
Now you got to get a different route.
Man,

1454
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:04.800
I don't like that.

1455
01:23:04.801 --> 01:23:07.210
They have to do a different round and you don't like it either.
I hate it.

1456
01:23:07.211 --> 01:23:10.780
That's what drives me now and so like the UFC x or this is the first x y I've

1457
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:13.840
ever missed.
I've been at everyone.
I love him,
man,
and the fans were like,
oh,

1458
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:15.940
this is bullshit.
Because I said,
I don't work for free.

1459
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:18.850
I'm not doing a fire in the kid podcast.
Live for free.
I'm not doing that.

1460
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.060
They wanted you to do it for free.
I'm not,
I'm not doing a sign in for free.

1461
01:23:22.061 --> 01:23:24.490
I'm just not going to do it.
But to do a podcast for free,

1462
01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:27.070
you guys would still put ads in those podcasts,
not a live one.

1463
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.000
There's no ads at a live podcast at the UC expo.
Well,
I don't understand.

1464
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.960
When you do your ads,
do you do your ads?
You read them live on the air.

1465
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.270
Typically.
I used to do it like that,
but then I got named Jim who?

1466
01:23:39.271 --> 01:23:43.300
Vernon in my life.
No,
but if you do a live podcast,
I'm not doing,

1467
01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:45.730
you know what I'm saying?
It's more,
it's a different scenario,

1468
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.730
but put that up on iTunes and you put ads on that.
We don't know when it did.

1469
01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:54.540
It would just be for that crowd toward it.
No,
we didn't last time.
What?

1470
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:57.520
Yeah.
Why would you not record it and put it out?
I don't think.

1471
01:23:57.550 --> 01:24:02.520
I don't think we had the capabilities.
Again,

1472
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:06.550
you need a man like young Jamie,
and you're like the sound of your time,

1473
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.870
but listen,
if there's a soundboard,

1474
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:09.700
the soundboard is broadcasting out to those people.

1475
01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:10.960
It's got a fucking auxiliary plot.

1476
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:15.040
He plugged in and you put an MP three recorder.
My right.
Yeah,
that's it.
Yeah,

1477
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:18.880
license and then you make money off the ads from that podcast is not free.

1478
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.600
I would do a podcast.
They asked me to do a podcast in the fight,
the fan expo.

1479
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:27.070
I had done it,
but it probably wouldn't want me to.
Okay.
We've done it before.

1480
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.940
I liked doing them.
[inaudible] is,
the point is,

1481
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.830
is we don't have to do that.
And we offer,
listen,
you Damon athlete,

1482
01:24:35.831 --> 01:24:37.540
that's been the USC who's been more open.
You can,

1483
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:40.420
I give you free shit for six hours a week doing podcasts,

1484
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:43.150
but there's never been an athlete in the UFC more open than I have talking to

1485
01:24:43.151 --> 01:24:47.110
fans.
So missing the fan expo,
it's not the end of the world.
Right?
Well,

1486
01:24:47.111 --> 01:24:50.920
you were already getting your own message out there on a regular basis,

1487
01:24:50.921 --> 01:24:54.910
but you mess this is also independent.
You,
you're not a company man.
You're here,

1488
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:55.830
you're rolling,
you're the coach,

1489
01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.430
you're a company man of the company's great and you're a huge supporter of view.

1490
01:24:59.431 --> 01:25:03.730
I've seen huge supporters,
but you're honest.
You know,
like that's fucking,

1491
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:07.960
it's hard to,
that's hard to,
that's important.
It's important.
It's hard to find.

1492
01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:09.670
It's hard to find a guy with balls like that.

1493
01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:13.810
But you also can do it because you're making more money from podcasting than you

1494
01:25:13.811 --> 01:25:17.530
do from finding,
correct.
I mean that's just,
yeah,
she just the way of the world,

1495
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:20.740
man.
So we are the world interest.
It's a this,

1496
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:25.330
this sport is still growing.
You know,
there's still some stuff to be worked out.

1497
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:29.110
I,
you know,
and I don't have the answers.
I don't know.
Let's do that.
I'm not,

1498
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.350
Dana's not at fault.
I'm,
I'm sure I might run it the same fucking way.

1499
01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:33.970
I'm not saying would do anything different.

1500
01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:36.700
I don't know what I do hard chocolate.
I'll tell you right now.

1501
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:37.870
I definitely wouldn't do it this way.

1502
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:41.830
[inaudible] we were regards to cutting the sponsors.

1503
01:25:41.831 --> 01:25:43.720
I would avoid anything to cross the fighters money,

1504
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:46.750
but I think they think that long term it's going to make the fighters money and

1505
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:50.470
maybe they're right.
But for a guy like,
like me or a guy who,
you know,

1506
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:54.340
Mitch reone or a guy like Ben Rothwell,
these guys currently on it,

1507
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.680
it's not helping us.
Those guys should be logged on,

1508
01:25:56.681 --> 01:26:01.000
but it makes a benefit within like the next two or three years.
I agree with you.

1509
01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:04.670
Yeah.
Because of Mitre,
like a guy like Ben who's on a tear right now,

1510
01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.440
Roswell and another like two,
three years.
Any,
you know,
who knows.
Not Young.

1511
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.520
No guy like DC is not young.
Not Young.
Yeah,
that's true.

1512
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:14.910
And Ron does knees.

1513
01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:18.200
She'd fight in another five years is her knees were fucked up.

1514
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.030
I mean shit from judo,
her knees,
her knees aren't the best.
Right.

1515
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:26.030
She can't do like roadwork and stuff.
She can't run.
She doesn't want to run.
Yeah,

1516
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:28.850
it needs are.
Yeah.
Well it's also like,

1517
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.810
you know that without the human growth hormone,
without any sort of,
I mean,

1518
01:26:32.811 --> 01:26:34.340
when they're,
when they're testing for everything,

1519
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:37.760
the way they're testing now we're gonna see a different playing field and you're

1520
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:40.690
gonna see younger fighters,
UFC fighters and they get to see him retire.

1521
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.990
See shorter careers.

1522
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:44.990
Tennessee 38 year old when I was making the same money with Philip who just

1523
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:49.820
retired,
really costly,
a good fighter man fighter.
When he came into the UFC,

1524
01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:51.260
he's like top 10 right away.

1525
01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:55.700
It could one of these five fucking vicious palace muscular like weird,

1526
01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:58.010
like Tim Kennedy kind of muscles.
Well,

1527
01:26:58.011 --> 01:27:00.890
he was great under Ray Longo when he left Ray Longo,
you know,

1528
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.460
I think there was a sort of a bit of a conflict because he was one 85 Chris

1529
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.560
Weidman was the champ,
you know,

1530
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:08.900
how can you train with the champions and who knows what kind of training

1531
01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:10.070
sessions they had to,
I mean,

1532
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:14.570
what led him to lead to leave rather what's going on with Tim Kennedy?

1533
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:16.700
Tim Kennedy,
he was talking about,
he's another,

1534
01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.200
he's another guy who who's not like do what?
Yeah,
he

1535
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.360
doesn't have to do like God.
Tim Kennedy is not anybody's bitch.
Period.
Oh,

1536
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.310
he's not.
He should be running things.

1537
01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:31.600
If Tim Kenny vote went for president right now,
I'd vote for him.
I go farm.

1538
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.860
Tim Kennedy,
Brian Stann fucking president,
Vice President Combo.
I'm in.

1539
01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:37.370
I'm in sign me up.

1540
01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.660
Stop reason why vote for Tim over Brian's cause Tim does that have any,
you know,

1541
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:44.660
there's no investment with UFC.
He's like,
do what?
No Man,

1542
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.450
I don't work for you guys.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't have a TV show.

1543
01:27:47.451 --> 01:27:48.360
I'm not doing it.
Announcing,

1544
01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:53.130
did you see what he said when the Reebok deal came out?
Tim?
Yes.
He'd say,

1545
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:56.960
oh,
she's like put out some tweet.
Um,

1546
01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.910
are you saying me to do that?

1547
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:02.570
You're going to give me $2,500 to be an exclusive,

1548
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:06.830
my exclusive sponsor.
Uh,
thank you very much for your generous software,

1549
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:09.870
but I'll pass that Scott Coker.
What's up?
Yeah.
How,

1550
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:14.270
how does that not violate your current contract with UFC?
Have you looked at,

1551
01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:19.160
I don't know.
I mean,
obviously it doesn't,
if they,
if they're doing it,
wow.
I mean,

1552
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.430
they're not stupid.
They,
they have the best lawyers in the world.

1553
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:25.370
There's a reason why they can do through stuff.
There's always wiggle room.

1554
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.620
I know.
You know what?
I don't,

1555
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:32.720
I don't think that it's a bad thing to get a big company involved and to

1556
01:28:32.721 --> 01:28:37.040
legitimize,
you know,
the passport.
If I'm reading blocked,
I'm like,
hell yeah.

1557
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.650
Right.
If I'm rebounding,
like,
damn,
we got,
we got all these guys,

1558
01:28:39.651 --> 01:28:43.190
we get Tim Kennedy for $2,500.
It's the best deal in the world,
right?

1559
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:47.510
We get big brown for 10 grand.
Oh,
hell yeah.
Man,
this is crazy.

1560
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.690
When you look at what those guys were making before that though,

1561
01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:53.720
it's just like man,
the to make the fighters take the hit like that.

1562
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:55.850
Well how many fighters though?

1563
01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:58.970
We're able to generate sponsorship money as far as like,

1564
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.480
was it the top five now the guys who have great personalities like Donald
Cowboy,

1565
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.920
who the fuck doesn't want that?
Who doesn't want to sponsor cowboy?
Yeah.
You know,

1566
01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:13.450
like I would buy a certain beer if I knew that Donald Serone drank after wins by

1567
01:29:13.711 --> 01:29:16.920
knockout,
he wins by knockout.
I'll fucking go.

1568
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.870
I'll drink a case of Budweiser that just to represent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I,

1569
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.030
yeah,
you better come of my fucking standup.

1570
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:27.090
Does a few guys like that that you'll like,
like if,

1571
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:31.350
if like Cain Velasquez wins,
you might drink to [inaudible].

1572
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.860
If that was his sponsor,
just like for cane clink glasses.

1573
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:38.340
What would someone like Donald Cerrone be making now with Reebok?
Like,
so he was,

1574
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:41.660
let's say it was making a hundred grand,
15 fights or 16 fights that,

1575
01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:45.570
I don't know.
I don't like it.
Me Neither know I don't want to get in trouble.

1576
01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:48.420
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't like talking about it.
I just wish,

1577
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.600
I wish guys made more money and wish it was more money for them to make.

1578
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.660
I wish there was more opportunities for them to figure out a way to retire

1579
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:56.780
safely and comfortably.

1580
01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.070
The old story with fighters and that hasn't always been the case.
Look at,

1581
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:01.740
that's also the thing with boxers.

1582
01:30:01.741 --> 01:30:04.800
Everybody wants to compare to Floyd Mayweather.
You watch Floyd Mayweather fight.

1583
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.260
You pay attention to how much those guys make the first fight of the night.

1584
01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:11.400
Pay attention to how most guys make on the undercard.
Very little.
Very little.

1585
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:14.410
Boxing in a way is probably worse than the UFC.
It is worse than the UFC.

1586
01:30:14.411 --> 01:30:19.411
Only thing is is Floyd Mayweather owns a piece of the promotion is 1% 0.01% he

1587
01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:24.230
is.
He's the fucking Mack daddy of the Mac Daddy's.
He's the man.
Yes,

1588
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:28.740
he's beat the game.
Here's a lot of top guys that will make $1 million a fight.

1589
01:30:28.741 --> 01:30:32.940
You know like there's,
there's a bunch of guys that do real well.
You know,

1590
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.990
the only thing I don't like is,
is if you do say,
man,
I don't like me.

1591
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:38.700
I think the Reebok kids are terrible.

1592
01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:40.890
Can I help him out 100% I think they're awful.

1593
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.260
I there should be no repercussions for saying that.

1594
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:47.370
There should be no backlash for saying,
well,
if it's under not,
here's the deal.

1595
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.270
If it's undeniable that it's good,
your opinion doesn't mean anything.

1596
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:54.930
But if you say they look like shit and it resonates,

1597
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:57.810
then they've got a problem with their design.
Like,
look,

1598
01:30:58.170 --> 01:31:01.590
you might not like this fucking Elvis in Japan shirt.
I'm digging.

1599
01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:05.520
That shit's dope as fuck.
Hell yeah.
You could tell me some people might like it,

1600
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:09.150
but just because I don't like it.
Cool man.
You could tell me all day that they,
I,

1601
01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:11.970
some people are going to say it's cool.
It doesn't matter,
right.
No matter what.

1602
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:14.160
Tell me all day that it sucks.
I don't care.

1603
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:17.610
You could tell me all day that Bj Penn jacket is stupid.
I don't care.

1604
01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.750
Just say it all all day.
I don't care cause I mean anything to me.
Well,

1605
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.140
you're definitely wrong in my mind for how I think what I like,

1606
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:26.770
which is wrong.
That's your opinion,
right?

1607
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:30.020
It's like you're calling me into the car.
Someone could say,
yeah,

1608
01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.910
but Porsche looks like shit.
You be like,
Oh,
good luck with that.

1609
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:38.010
Are you talking about bro with the poison nine nine one big modern port.

1610
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.100
Good luck.
Good luck with all that.
Right,

1611
01:31:41.101 --> 01:31:43.140
but when you say the Reebok kits sucks and you go,

1612
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:48.420
you did say something interesting about Reebok,
like shoes.

1613
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.280
They'd had a tough time marketing their shoes.
Like,

1614
01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:52.710
I don't know a lot of people like where are the shoes?
Crossfitters,

1615
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.260
they're big and crossfit.
Crossfit.

1616
01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:00.070
They sponsor a huge cross guarantee.

1617
01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:01.930
Huge in Europe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1618
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:05.080
I guarantee most crossfitters who go to crossfit gyms don't worry box.

1619
01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:07.840
They wear their shoes.
You're a pussy.
Feels just like American pussy.

1620
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.300
The same bill.
It's not like Mexican cocacola

1621
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:19.210
formula.
I mean,

1622
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:23.100
what could he do man?
The Reeboks.
Yeah,
man,
look,
dude is what it is.
Listen,

1623
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.450
there's nothing we can do.
Yeah.

1624
01:32:25.451 --> 01:32:27.560
Look if someone gave me Reebok sneakers in cities,

1625
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:30.370
the only sneakers you can wear it for the rest of your life.
It wouldn't hurt me.

1626
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.420
Trash.
Yeah,
but it's whatever.
I'm just kidding.

1627
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.960
Just kidding Brendon.
No,
I'm just kidding.
Yeah,
man.
I think that,
uh,

1628
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:44.240
it's good that a big sponsor has gotten involved with you.

1629
01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:48.250
I think it's good for a bunch of big sponsors get involved and then that 10,000

1630
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:52.200
becomes 100,000.
That'd be sweet,
man.
Damn,
that's the goal when we're talking.

1631
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:56.080
But I think that with the Reebok thing,

1632
01:32:56.081 --> 01:33:00.390
it's an exclusive apparel contract because a lot like fight chicks,
they could,

1633
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:03.940
they had to say that they weren't going to be at the expo and a lot of other

1634
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:08.060
apparel companies say they weren't going to be at the B Cam.
Yeah,

1635
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:13.000
you can't because Reebok is the exclusive apparel contract.
Uh,
we used to,

1636
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.150
I used to make good money off the expos too.

1637
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.040
There's a lot of those companies that you'd be a great weekend for me.
Yeah.

1638
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:23.740
It's not great weekend.
I'll do six,
seven appearances.
Good money,
man.
Damn.

1639
01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:28.090
It's not the first one I've ever missed.
Listen,
when you make these,

1640
01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:29.530
when you make these big decisions,

1641
01:33:29.531 --> 01:33:31.210
you're not worried about guys like Brendan Schaub.

1642
01:33:31.211 --> 01:33:32.440
You're not worried about these other guys.

1643
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:34.270
So you're worried about the best thing for the company.

1644
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.450
And I'm not saying that to Dana White.
It might be a great decision.

1645
01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.200
I don't know that.

1646
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:41.920
And they take people like Rhonda and Connor and they give them exclusive deals

1647
01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:44.320
where they get big money.
So Ronnie gets big money.

1648
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:47.890
John Jones had big money before his car accident.
Connor Connor is big money.

1649
01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:52.240
Y'All year Rodriguez got slammed.
Mcdonald's pays on it.
Entity.
Yup.
Banking.

1650
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:57.250
And Rory does.
Does Reebok still have to keep sponsoring Jon Jones?
No.

1651
01:33:57.251 --> 01:34:01.470
No,
no,
no.
He's,
they canceled that immediately.
Immediately.
He's not well,

1652
01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.050
he's suspending death.
Well,
no,
no,
no.
He canceled it before he was suspended.
None.

1653
01:34:05.051 --> 01:34:08.620
No,
no.
But if he's still,
but let's say he fought next month he's wearing Reebok.

1654
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.770
So you're still sponsoring Jon Jones?
Yes,
but he's not exclusive.

1655
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:14.330
He doesn't have the exclusive deal that he had before when they were sponsoring

1656
01:34:14.331 --> 01:34:17.970
him.
Outside of his fights,
fighting with Reebok on your sponsor.

1657
01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.710
If Travis Browne,
let's say whatever,

1658
01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:23.650
he beats up his wife and he fights next month.

1659
01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.210
He's still Rocky's wearing a Reebok.
They don't let there like it or not.

1660
01:34:28.211 --> 01:34:30.940
You're still sponsored that very weird place for Reebok to,

1661
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:33.910
because now they have to kind of get involved in whether or not this guy fights

1662
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:38.230
because that can be,
that's very damaging to,
that's a big risk for them.

1663
01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:42.910
Where you go,
you fucked up.
They use
more pros then.

1664
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:45.100
I don't know.
I mean it's a good point though.
I Dunno man,

1665
01:34:45.101 --> 01:34:46.180
because now they're kind of,

1666
01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:49.900
they can't help but get involved in whether or not this guy fights and Reebok

1667
01:34:49.901 --> 01:34:51.340
and where's there.
If you've been,

1668
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:54.570
let's just say it's the same as the NFL before the trial comes out.

1669
01:34:54.571 --> 01:34:58.190
I ray rice place,
you have a Reebok or Nike Jersey on.
I'm wear Nike.

1670
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.350
They can't control that,
but you can sponsor everyone.

1671
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:03.320
You have to sponsor everyone.
You're going to sponsor some bad apples,

1672
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:07.760
but most are good,
right?
I Dunno.
Yeah.
That's everything.
Thanks man.

1673
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.140
It's true.
It is a,

1674
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:12.860
it's one of those things where you've got a big company and they have their say

1675
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.500
and then they have to protect their name.
You know?

1676
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.400
Do you think that a compromise would be that one guy would wear like plain

1677
01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:23.100
shorts?
Reebok would say,
you know what,
we just can't.
Yes,
you might want to let,

1678
01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:26.240
when I wouldn't be a uniform,
I wouldn't be surprised that they said that.

1679
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.820
I wouldn't be surprised if they said,
hey,
in this case,
you know,

1680
01:35:28.821 --> 01:35:32.330
but I wouldn't be surprised if they gave them the exact same shorts but didn't

1681
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:33.164
put a logo on it.

1682
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:36.410
If they had a compromise and made him wear Reebok short but didn't have the logo

1683
01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:38.150
on it,
you couldn't wear anything else.
They might,

1684
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.390
but it would have to be like extreme example where there's like a debate and a

1685
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:43.100
fucking closed room.
It's interesting.

1686
01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:46.390
And Dana White's heads turning red and fucking Reebok guys yelling too.

1687
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.980
And then all right,
here's the deal,
here's the deal,
here's the compromise.

1688
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.330
You know,
it would have to be one of those teams.

1689
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.500
Just say it'll be Reba and no k on the end to do it.
First of all,

1690
01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:59.450
let's break down this fucking card because this card is insane.
This is,

1691
01:35:59.451 --> 01:36:00.260
I think,

1692
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.490
may don't say better than UFC 100 I'm going to pass out one of the best cards of

1693
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:08.300
all time.
Listen to what we got here.
We got shut.

1694
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:11.990
Shut the fuck dude.
How could you disagree?

1695
01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:16.610
I'm going to piss off a brand.
Men.
Boys reach as long Mcgregor.
I fucking love it.

1696
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.620
Okay.
Robbie Lawler versus Roy MacDonald over life.
Fucking.

1697
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.260
Now let's talk a little bit about that.
Keep gone.
No,
but hold on a second.

1698
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:28.640
Here's a fight.
People sleeping on Dennis Bermudez versus Jeremy Stevens.

1699
01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:32.570
That's a good fucking fight,
man.
That's a very good fight.

1700
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:37.790
Here's another five people were sleeping on gunner Nelson versus Brendan Dassey,

1701
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.510
Brandon,
Brandon,
thatch.
That's,
thank you very much.
Not You.

1702
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.620
Different faces in a very dry.
That's a good fucking [inaudible],
man.

1703
01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.720
That's fucking good fight.
That's a very good fight.
And Gunnar Nelson,

1704
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.400
by the way,
Gunnar Nelson is wicked fucking ground fighter.

1705
01:36:55.670 --> 01:37:00.340
Really choked out.
Jeff Manson beat Jeff Monson.
Bro.
I might not choke me.

1706
01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.000
He beat him if he'd just beat him.

1707
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:05.120
He didn't choke beat somebody choked him out recently,

1708
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:11.530
but he's from Iceland.
They're all wearing Reebok now.
Wow.
If we could,

1709
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.730
I mean to say this,
one of the best cards all the time,

1710
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.670
you bring up UFC 100 it will knock your dick in the dirt.

1711
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.080
Matt Brown versus Tim Means Motherfucker.
No one's even talking about that shit.

1712
01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.420
That's a good fucking fight
for me.
That's a great fight,

1713
01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:31.190
man.
That's a Chinese.
What?
FC 100 is bigger than this?

1714
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.220
UFC 100 is bigger than this
last one.

1715
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.320
Not to me.
Not to me.
Are you fucking shitting notes?

1716
01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:42.380
It's bigger on paper as far as like the appeal,

1717
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:46.850
but as far as like stylistically Alvez,
Dan Henderson,

1718
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.930
GSP,
GSP,
Thiago,
Alves time.
Here's a question.

1719
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:53.390
What are the biggest superstar app they,
these superstars.

1720
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.580
These are two Munsters flower wise.
These are great.
That's all I give a fuck.

1721
01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:03.570
Talking about superstars,
Joe Rogan,
he's talking about her mother fucker.

1722
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:08.571
Brennan go to youth and 102 means knock the dirt.

1723
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:15.600
Back in the day.
There was Superbowl cards.
He just turned it off.
I don't like,
no.

1724
01:38:15.601 --> 01:38:20.020
He did a super bowl.
Why is John Howard,
who was going to fight Brandon?
Thatch Y,

1725
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:23.640
Z now fighting somebody else in the prelims in the undercard accuse me,

1726
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:28.230
but John Howard was supposed to fight,
fight Brandon thatch.
Hey,
100 injuries.

1727
01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:32.670
You can see 100 on the undercard is John Jones.
Mark Coleman,

1728
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.900
what?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I like this card.

1729
01:38:38.050 --> 01:38:42.300
Look at that.
Look at the main Khan Jones versus Jayco.
Brian,
come on.

1730
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:45.520
That's a slaughter.
Stilts.
Jon Jones on an undercarriage.

1731
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:48.330
John Jumps before he was a champion,
a fucking monster.

1732
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.980
He was a bad moving in the dark,

1733
01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.520
but Matt Brown versus Tim means it's a better fight to me than Jon Jones was the

1734
01:38:53.521 --> 01:38:55.480
Chicco.
Brian John John's versus Jayco.

1735
01:38:55.481 --> 01:38:59.420
Brian is an opportunity to watch John Jones choke out.
Jacob district spend.

1736
01:38:59.421 --> 01:39:02.190
That shit was so dope.

1737
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.720
Tim Means Versus Matt Brown is going to be a fucking crazy war.
Look at that.

1738
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:09.960
Look at that main card.
It's a good fight.
Oh,
much good car.

1739
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:12.510
Henderson versus Bisping is an all time classic.

1740
01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.280
I remember with that George people knock out,

1741
01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.730
they came and show that finishing yell.
No.

1742
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.970
Remember when came down there like edit bench itself and that shit.

1743
01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:23.190
He killed him.
Yeah,
they took that off.

1744
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:27.240
Launched him outstand Hindou's signature logo.
Yeah,
him flying through the air.

1745
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:30.210
Imagine being Bisbing and seeing that logo everywhere for it and knowing what

1746
01:39:30.211 --> 01:39:34.150
that man ain't Pierre when he goes,
I pulled my groin and and uh,

1747
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.150
Craig Jackson goes,
then hit him with your groin.

1748
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:38.160
I thought it was the weirdest thing to say.
I was like,
wow,

1749
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:41.580
there it is not very helpful when there weren't so many cards.

1750
01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:44.640
Like I think we're used to a little bit of Wa water down card.
So we're like,

1751
01:39:44.641 --> 01:39:46.770
damn,
this shit is blockbuster son.

1752
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.660
It's good if you go back the back in the day there was some fucking super wall

1753
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:56.100
card.
Yeah.
There's some big names there.
There's definitely big names there.

1754
01:39:56.101 --> 01:39:59.880
Mark Houma versus Stephan Bonner to me is not as interesting as Gunnar Nelson

1755
01:39:59.881 --> 01:40:04.020
versus Brandon.
Thank you.
100% that's a bigger fight or flight.
Yeah.
Being here.

1756
01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:07.260
I Dunno.
Better,
bigger doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't give a fuck.

1757
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:10.770
I'm there for all of them.
So for me aficionados,
you're fucking,

1758
01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.640
you know what I'm saying?
Like,
oh I know my tastes are d.
Look,

1759
01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:17.130
I want to tell it to me whether Manny Pacquiao fight.
I love that.
Me Too.

1760
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:19.620
I love that to be,
you know boxing.

1761
01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:22.280
You understand how difficult it is to do with Mayweather.

1762
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:26.520
Did do a guy like fucking pack.
Yeah.
This fight is going to be chaos.

1763
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:30.330
Chaos because both these guys are animals too.
Dirty bird.

1764
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:33.480
What is causing the most underrated guys in the UFC right now,

1765
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:38.100
Tim means is a fucking savage.
He is a very skilled fighter.

1766
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.540
Phenomenal match,
a very,

1767
01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:43.830
very good match and Matt Brown is more fighters like Santa styles or styles.

1768
01:40:43.831 --> 01:40:47.700
Very,
very,
very,
very similar lives.
Mirror images of each other.

1769
01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:51.330
Matt and Josh and gets thrown out the window.
Both guys are warriors.

1770
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:55.270
Matt Brown is a fucking demon.
He's a hero.
He really is.

1771
01:40:55.271 --> 01:40:59.560
He is a d steal souls bro.
Straight up breaks guys.
He really never,

1772
01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:02.320
I never seen a guy break guys away.
Matt Brown does.

1773
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:05.770
He's a totally different animal.
You know,
he doesn't always win,
but you know the,

1774
01:41:05.771 --> 01:41:08.620
the Hendricks fight exposed a whole in his game,
man,

1775
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.430
that guy like Hendrix could just take them down grind to Maui to take down to

1776
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:17.200
know this is like,
yeah,
let's do this.
Let's see what happens.

1777
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:20.620
That's going to be a wildfire.
Buy Low and that's a perfect fight for Fox sports.

1778
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:24.250
One prelims to get people to set up to watch the main event on paper view cause

1779
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:26.980
you're going to be frothing at the mouth by the time this fight is over.

1780
01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:29.790
I just loved the dirty bird.
I think that's the greatest animal.

1781
01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.340
He's a wicked and he's got evil eyes from Atlanta as a motherfucker when I

1782
01:41:33.341 --> 01:41:37.690
interview them.
And one was like,
Ooh,
that sounds like darkness gets dirty bird.

1783
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:41.800
There's both,
these guys are doors on the early prelims.
Anyone hey,

1784
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.210
okay,
well those early prelims keep,
keep,
keep going.

1785
01:41:46.211 --> 01:41:50.890
Paul Penn dread versus what site to who is the old man?
He looks like a dentist.

1786
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:55.900
The guy on the right.
The crazy shit.
It's a tough guy.
I'm about two taps on,

1787
01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:00.970
I don't know,
Dude.
That salt
is a very,

1788
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:04.030
very crafty fighter.
Let me tell you something.
He's old.

1789
01:42:04.031 --> 01:42:07.420
He's like 35 every bit of seven it looks 75 years old there.
I mean,

1790
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.380
that's impressive.
Well,
let's,

1791
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.060
how old does he find out how old somebody put his face on a body?
I might be,

1792
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:15.660
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but that's you.
To watch him fight.
Incredible.

1793
01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:20.310
It's very skillful shit and cubes.
Bribe.
I try to be a dick.
I will.
Okay.

1794
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.910
Let's take a guess.
How old do you think Neil is?

1795
01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:24.250
I'm saying he's 16 he just turned eight.

1796
01:42:24.251 --> 01:42:27.100
He's 52 just turned 59 here's what you guys are assholes.

1797
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.230
We're just saying 35 thank you.
And my knowledge of age is impeccable.
He,

1798
01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:34.690
I like watching him fight.
He's a crafty veteran.

1799
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.520
I appreciate the fuck out of that.
Got me two minutes
to get his hands on.

1800
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:42.550
Brian.
I called his lap.
He would,
he would rape you.
I would love that.

1801
01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.870
I called his last fight and I enjoyed it very much.
Hey guys,

1802
01:42:46.871 --> 01:42:51.400
I'm just saying it's a bad picture.
Smokers.
No joke dude.
Smoke as a tough kid.

1803
01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:54.970
This is a good fight.
That's a very good fight.
I liked that fight.
Brad.

1804
01:42:54.971 --> 01:42:56.590
Pixie versus I need is a good fight.

1805
01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:59.950
Look at the big fights we were discussed Nelson versus,

1806
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:01.270
that is a big fight to me.

1807
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:04.720
Matt Brown versus Tim Means I'm looking forward to that fight as much as any

1808
01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:08.200
fight this year.
Really?
You know why?
Because that's fucking the style wise.

1809
01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:11.650
The style wise is pure chaos.
Well Wise Matt Brown,

1810
01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:15.430
it's very skillful means it's very skillful.
Whole percent for Roche.
Ferocious.

1811
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:19.360
I love that fight and Nelson versus dash.
I fucking love that fight.

1812
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:24.010
I'm she styles big clashes style since not exactly a finisher.

1813
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.170
Well he can if he gets you on the ground,

1814
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:31.290
but that she is a warrior does take any huge Kao power is undenying stand up at

1815
01:43:32.141 --> 01:43:35.590
some of the best than the Dennis Bermudez was on a roll until Lopez.

1816
01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:40.330
A llama stops when llamas stopped him and [inaudible] seven zero two get caught

1817
01:43:40.331 --> 01:43:43.130
up with that beautiful canteen.
Lamas.
Skeptical,
Sidestep Kia team.

1818
01:43:43.131 --> 01:43:46.600
We traps that arm.
Who Bermuda's is Bonnie.
Yeah.
Kick ass thighs.

1819
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.350
But Donka dark brown to get it all brown ass on.
Jeremy Stevens.

1820
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:53.030
You want to talk about a murder or a striker?

1821
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:57.260
That kid can fucking bang and he's getting better all the time to train in down

1822
01:43:57.261 --> 01:44:01.550
there.
And I'm in San Diego.
I don't the man the cards,
ridiculous.

1823
01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:05.210
Robbie Lawler versus Rory Macdonald.
People were selling songs about that.

1824
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:07.940
Their sleep.
I know you don't want to call things,

1825
01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:11.050
but Robbie Lawler is a mother fucker dude.

1826
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:15.720
You know why his mother Rdo late Liza rounds to yup.

1827
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:18.620
And he knows how to pace himself.
He didn't kind of,
in the Hendricks fight,

1828
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:21.380
he kind of went at him guns blazing that first round.
Tried to kill him.

1829
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:25.890
I heard he doesn't spar.
He does.
He doesn't,
he used not stopped for a long time,

1830
01:44:25.891 --> 01:44:30.230
but a big part of his resurrection,
his him training at 18 te,
te,

1831
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:34.270
te,
te.
They went to American top team.
Shit.
His,
uh,

1832
01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.610
that was a big part of his resurrection is also he started sparring again there.

1833
01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:41.070
Got It.
He looks like a bad mother.
She's just so calculated it.

1834
01:44:41.071 --> 01:44:43.530
And when they fought last night,
it was a close fight,
remember?
Yeah.

1835
01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:45.850
And Roy had a fucked up ankle.
No fight.
Yeah.

1836
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:49.580
I think a lot of cheeses nickname again.
Now he's the Red King Sun.

1837
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:53.300
He was areas that Canadian psycho.
He likes red king.
I think it's where the best,

1838
01:44:53.301 --> 01:44:55.890
I think he's,
I think he and Carlos Condit.
Yeah.
I'd let,

1839
01:44:55.930 --> 01:44:59.210
that's the fight I'd like to see,
I think was the best 70 pounder.

1840
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.870
I would like to see that.

1841
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:01.820
I think he's going to win this fight and they very fast.

1842
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:04.640
I know that he was a lot younger.
Oh,
he was real young.

1843
01:45:04.641 --> 01:45:08.170
I was 21 I think,
you know,
uh,

1844
01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.530
Roy's the favorite in this crazy,
but he's a different fighter,
Rory.
I can see it.

1845
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:13.600
Those Robbie,
Robbie,

1846
01:45:13.601 --> 01:45:17.930
Robbie's lately Campion of the pharmacy world is that he's a different fighter

1847
01:45:17.931 --> 01:45:20.660
too and he's going to come into this fight.
A different fighter.

1848
01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.890
This is a very interesting fight,

1849
01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:25.190
but if Rory can start picking apart technique wise,

1850
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.980
that's when things get interesting because Rory with full movement,

1851
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:31.220
Roy had a fucked up ankle in that fight.
I think Roy wins this fight.

1852
01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:36.200
Detroit wins this fight and close fight Robbie's site or Robbie does what he did

1853
01:45:36.201 --> 01:45:38.240
in the first fight and it hurts them bad.
I agree.

1854
01:45:38.241 --> 01:45:42.020
Then maybe even finishes them off.
Who knows?
Who knows?
I love that fight.
I like,

1855
01:45:42.021 --> 01:45:45.230
I like Roy.
That's going to be just his,
that's going to be incredible.

1856
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:50.210
Maybe has McGregor man
Mendez.
I have no idea what to expect in that fight.

1857
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.790
Mendez took this fight on short notice,
so you would,

1858
01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.780
a big factor in this fight is how much was Mendez training before he got the

1859
01:45:56.781 --> 01:46:01.010
call?
How much was he training?
Because your five rounds.
Here's another factor.

1860
01:46:01.011 --> 01:46:04.880
Are they allowed to use ivs in this fight?
I don't know.

1861
01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:09.920
That's for Chad Mendez fight the big cut for both guys.
Right?

1862
01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:12.230
They said that Conor Mcgregor,
according to Chael Sonnen,

1863
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.980
Conor McGregor is cutting 27 pounds this week.
Oh my God.

1864
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:21.680
Seven d two one seven and I believe a man,
when he said,
when I stand next to him,

1865
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.040
fuck,
he's a big dude.
Big Dude.
See that picture of me and him next to each other.

1866
01:46:25.041 --> 01:46:28.970
I was like,
damn,
he's very wide and you know,
I mean that's one of the reason.

1867
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:32.510
Yeah,
he's thick and you know it's all where the punching power comes from.

1868
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:36.830
It's all shoulders and I love Chadman I,
I love Mendez.

1869
01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:41.130
He's one of the good guys.
He's the best guy.
Conor McGregor is ever fought cars.

1870
01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:43.530
No,
not even close.
He's a totally different,

1871
01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.210
I can't Connor beat a guy to this level.
You know what I'm saying?

1872
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:50.400
Like that is the question.
I want to see him do it.
Agree.
I root for greatness.

1873
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:53.290
I want to see great.
I do too,
but I root for Chad's greatness as well.

1874
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:58.560
Like I said,
I love both guys.
I think if I'm the UFC brass,
we want Connor to win,

1875
01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:01.470
but we're not giving them any fucking layups.

1876
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.170
This is a conversation that Dana and I had on the phone.
I said,
listen man,

1877
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:05.910
you got to think about who is your biggest paper view star.

1878
01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:08.600
And it was a gentlemen,
George St Pierre was the biggest peer review star.

1879
01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.490
Good looking gentlemen and that's Chad Mendez.
But guess what?

1880
01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.040
George St Pierre was always foreign away.

1881
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:15.570
Just he'd beat everybody and he always know Matt,

1882
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.560
Matt Serra and knocked him on one IX after that,

1883
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:21.570
but want to know he was he across to everybody no matter who is tapped him out.

1884
01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720
Look,
he lost.
I know that that was what that was.

1885
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:27.090
Two guy or so students stay with him when he became champion.

1886
01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:30.540
Do you understand this?
The same thing with Mendez.
Same thing with Mendez.

1887
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:33.650
Mendez lost twice to the best fucking guy on the planet earth.
True.

1888
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:36.580
He lost once by knockout.
He got caught with a needle.

1889
01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:41.250
George was a a different star because he represented Canada and u so dominant

1890
01:47:41.251 --> 01:47:44.970
for a very,
very long time after he lost,
says,
when's this?

1891
01:47:44.971 --> 01:47:48.870
I think this belt rotates.
That's what I think too.
Who knows,

1892
01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:51.930
man or Mendez could go on,
Goddamn Tara and become a dominant champion.

1893
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:55.710
Knock out all during the rematch for the title for the undisputed title.

1894
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.870
Anything can happen.
It's a different time because he was doing it this

1895
01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:06.570
way.
Morton one 45 is as deep as it gets now.
And there's the dark horse killers.

1896
01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.740
Amor Connie killer [inaudible] Rodriguez Driggins is fucking terrifying.

1897
01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:13.920
Terrifying.
2123 years old.
One 45.

1898
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:16.830
How about fucking uh,
Max Holloway?

1899
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.040
That mother fucker gets better every time he fights it with Cub Swanson.

1900
01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:24.840
Fantastic.
We heard is Kyle [inaudible] Gregory beating him,

1901
01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.310
got him on the ground in a guard pass position popped as you pop.

1902
01:48:28.311 --> 01:48:32.100
Does this Conor McGregor have wrestlers he trains with who are on the level of

1903
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:38.810
like,
he's not training with a Mendez,
but he's trained with very good.
Yeah,

1904
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.970
he's seen you don't get this level of Outbrain,

1905
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:45.690
but as far as like a high level MMA wrestler who's also a banger like Chad

1906
01:48:45.691 --> 01:48:49.110
Mendez,
we tough to find.
It's only like a few guys on the planet and Candice.

1907
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:51.960
So how do you prepare for that kind of pressure all the time?

1908
01:48:51.961 --> 01:48:55.110
You just have guys constantly trying to take,
well,
it's a different game.
See,

1909
01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:59.550
he's got a different,
the thing is he's fighting a totally different style now.

1910
01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.000
He was going to fight a guy who he probably didn't really have to worry too much

1911
01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:06.630
about taking them down when he had to worry about is being heavy on his left
leg.

1912
01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:07.680
If he stands Orthodox,

1913
01:49:07.681 --> 01:49:11.910
you've gotta be real careful because all those kicks come 30% faster than

1914
01:49:11.911 --> 01:49:16.050
anybody else in the division.
They come and that fucking Shin is a whip.

1915
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:21.250
It just why hitting that thigh and then you feel the throbbing and you realize

1916
01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:24.400
like,
oh my God,
I can't take money that your rye,

1917
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:28.200
a faber fight is a Goddamn wake up call to anybody you want to learn about what

1918
01:49:28.201 --> 01:49:30.600
happens to your fucking leg.
True Frankie Edgar,

1919
01:49:30.601 --> 01:49:32.730
Frank Gagra put a stop to those leg kicks.

1920
01:49:32.731 --> 01:49:34.760
He just dove into a double leg every time it had happened.

1921
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:36.230
Frankie and literally really had motherfucker.

1922
01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:39.150
He just blew and then he stopped throwing that leg kick.
He stopped throwing it.

1923
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:41.670
Well,
that's his boy,
right Henry?
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

1924
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.570
Mark can Mark Henry really fucking is a fantastic coach,
cause a mastermind.

1925
01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.520
They really would just dive in like he'd get kicked him Tom and just go into it

1926
01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:52.270
and then she like,
I don't want to find to me man.
Very interesting.

1927
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:54.520
It would be interesting.
And they both had full camps.

1928
01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.560
It's interesting now with the added element,

1929
01:49:56.561 --> 01:49:58.930
the fact they didn't have full camp bear for each other.

1930
01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.590
Of course Connor is in full camp for all those so he's going to be in shape.

1931
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:06.400
But strategically game plan wise and having those,

1932
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:10.520
those fine motor skills prepared for stuffing that take down,

1933
01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:14.290
keeping the fight on the feet,
preparing for an orthodox wrestler,
he never saw.

1934
01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:16.860
So bet you he wasn't even working stuffing take dance.

1935
01:50:16.861 --> 01:50:18.490
Cause although that isn't a guy who takes you down,

1936
01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.850
well he certainly would work on it was working it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1937
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:22.790
Certainly level Brian Without fucking,

1938
01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:26.410
but that's not a huge part of your guys in practice.

1939
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.570
They're not just gonna sit there like trying to take you down.

1940
01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:32.530
It's MMA and you're just not going to bring in strikers and bringing all sorts

1941
01:50:32.531 --> 01:50:35.990
of guys.
Yeah.
It's a good fight.
His,
his boy is a,

1942
01:50:35.991 --> 01:50:40.991
is a Nelson is boys Nelson Phenomena Jujitsu and very good to take down.

1943
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.620
There's a lot to like about this fight a lot to a,

1944
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.940
I liked this fight as much as I liked the Aldo fight,
if not more.

1945
01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:52.780
I really do because I've been wanting to see if you're right.
You're allowed to.

1946
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:57.460
I've been wanting to see Conor fight a wrestler but not on a 12 week notice.

1947
01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.500
I don't want you to share.
It happened.
I do.
I've got a real problem.

1948
01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:03.570
Hey,

1949
01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:07.000
got to hear his coach and you're kind of swim coach and you know he's been taken

1950
01:51:07.001 --> 01:51:09.670
down.
You just tell him to keep standing up.
No Jujitsu.
Just keep standing up.

1951
01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:13.360
Keep trying to stand up.
What kind of strategy and a fucking old man can you,

1952
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:18.010
can you just start with what do you ask him?
What you tell him?
It's Connor man.

1953
01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:21.310
He does his thing.
He,
you got to remember it.
He got taken down by Dennis Seaver.

1954
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:24.490
I know people forget that he got taken down,
popped up,

1955
01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:26.290
but he got taken down like three or four times.

1956
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.710
It's hard to pop up against Chapman.
Has He got taken down?

1957
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:32.590
We probably didn't anticipate that it was going to turn into a wrestling match

1958
01:51:32.591 --> 01:51:36.620
at all.
And it was taken down by Dennis Eve.
Right?

1959
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:38.320
Probably that's what worries me

1960
01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:43.140
was Chapman is no fucking joke dude.
Oh and,
and then,

1961
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:47.800
but the problem is if I'm a betting man,
which I've been known to bed,

1962
01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:52.210
if I'm a betting man,
I think Chapman does Knox mountain the third round,

1963
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:56.310
faking a takedown land and overhand.
That's what I think my,

1964
01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.680
my what my heart wants.
I want calm and go out there and win.

1965
01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.090
Why do you just Conor to win?

1966
01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:05.140
I want Connor week cause I like what he stands for and,
and when I met him,

1967
01:52:05.141 --> 01:52:09.130
he was just a natural,
genuinely good dude and he's beating the game.

1968
01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:13.250
I like people who beat the game.
He's a star.
He's the 1% of one percenters.

1969
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.170
And he backs it up.
He's our Mohammed Ali to see a guy lose on a,

1970
01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:20.110
on a match up that he got on 12 days notice.
Again,

1971
01:52:20.111 --> 01:52:22.800
it's a completely different style.
I don't want to see him go out like that.

1972
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:27.610
He's so excited.
He was out for a grip.
You got to remember he was in the UFC.

1973
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.280
He lost,
he didn't come into the gym has coaching like,
Bro,

1974
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.530
you don't come back in the gym man.
Just get outta here.

1975
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:37.600
I don't want to see him go out and like that man.
He,
he has a chance to be great.

1976
01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:40.360
He still entertain to be our Lebron James,

1977
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:42.820
but of course some horrible happens like this.

1978
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:46.010
What happens to a man because that's not,
you think the UFC is fucking up.

1979
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.840
<v 0>You think the UFC should just postpone the fight?</v>

1980
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:50.390
I think it's a bad idea what they're doing or they shouldn't fight with your

1981
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:53.500
mentors.
If I was his manager,
and I swear to God I said this on the podcast,
I,

1982
01:52:53.501 --> 01:52:56.870
I would,
I would tell him to fake a fucking injury and wait till October.

1983
01:52:56.871 --> 01:52:59.870
I really want you guys got to understand how much money has been spent on this

1984
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:02.680
prime scan you're looking at.
You're looking at it very short.

1985
01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:04.220
Just like the Reebok deal,

1986
01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:15.680
very shortsighted,

1987
01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:22.070
quick buck this weekend.
In the grand scheme of things,

1988
01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:24.710
he has potential to be your biggest star of all time,

1989
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:28.040
but let's give him the worst matchup.
[inaudible] on 12 days notice,
but,

1990
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:30.200
and he just went through a whole camp.
Who knows if he's healthy,

1991
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:33.430
but if he wins and he's the best,
that's the Ganzel

1992
01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:40.370
interim title.
Big Jose.
I'm coming for the other belt.

1993
01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.570
I've got the real bad.

1994
01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:45.560
I want to hear spit bucket and shine up my belt and bring it here to me.

1995
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:50.830
If he wins.
Oh,
it pays off huge.
It's the fuck.
Yes.
Everyone knew

1996
01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.830
getting some questions about him,
man.

1997
01:53:54.831 --> 01:53:58.580
There's so many questions and that's what's exciting about the Mendez fight is

1998
01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:01.190
that it's to look for sure,
although was going to test them,

1999
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:04.850
but men is going to fucking test him to in a different way.
For sure.

2000
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.850
We need to find out whether or not they can use [inaudible] for this fight.

2001
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.600
I'm just saying it's resident.
I'm saying it's rare.

2002
01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:14.500
You get a guy of his capabilities and we,
we,

2003
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.370
we have something that could be great here.

2004
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:20.900
His entertainment value 12 days is tough.
I just love his energy.

2005
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:23.960
He makes me want to fight,
see the fight.
He's so exciting.

2006
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.770
He's such a great shot and chat and I love chatting.

2007
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:28.730
Everyone knows I love people that are listening.

2008
01:54:28.731 --> 01:54:31.580
Please let me know if you do know whether or not,

2009
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:33.710
because we're not going to go with this waltz happened and please let me know if

2010
01:54:33.711 --> 01:54:37.820
you know whether or not they're going to be able to use ivs during this fight.

2011
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:42.500
If they'd be able to use IVF after this Williams cause eventually it's going to

2012
01:54:42.501 --> 01:54:46.040
be giant.
And especially when you got a guy like Conor is cut in 27 towns,

2013
01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.840
where did you get that statistic about?

2014
01:54:47.841 --> 01:54:51.860
It takes seven days to fully recharge or a medic on an army medic on the set of

2015
01:54:51.861 --> 01:54:54.230
kingdom who is,
who is a restaurant college and he was,

2016
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:57.330
he was talking about how he said the biggest problem with this ivy thing,

2017
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:59.780
and this is just him.
Yeah,
I don't know if it's right,
but he said,

2018
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:03.920
he said the biggest problem is that you can see a lot more traumatic brain

2019
01:55:03.921 --> 01:55:07.730
injury if guys aren't allowed to hydrate with Ivs and ideas.

2020
01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:12.110
It takes a long time to hydrate orally as opposed to with an IV.

2021
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:16.070
And he said that to get fully hydrated where your cells are,

2022
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:18.260
where they were before it takes up to seven days.

2023
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:20.180
I don't know if that's the case,

2024
01:55:20.181 --> 01:55:25.160
but that's what Andy Foster said that a good percentage of fighters are fighting

2025
01:55:25.161 --> 01:55:29.580
dehydrated fruit.
Get into the octagon.
They're not your brain.
No,

2026
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.793
not good for your.

2027
01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.710
A lot of time you see guys who weren't successful at one weight class,

2028
01:55:33.711 --> 01:55:36.680
they cut weight class and then their chin goes choose cause they're cutting a

2029
01:55:36.681 --> 01:55:39.530
lot of weight so you don't have that fluid in the brewery.
Dangerous.

2030
01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:44.100
Jimmy's got some information for us.
This,
okay,
first,
that means

2031
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.670
<v 2>UFC one 89 participants can expect to be a part of the new regime.</v>

2032
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:52.080
Oh,
oh my God,

2033
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:56.980
so this one 89 they can't fucking rehydrate.

2034
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:57.691
Let me ask you this.

2035
01:55:57.691 --> 01:56:01.170
How do they know if a guy rehydrates with electrolyte and fluid?
Well,

2036
01:56:01.171 --> 01:56:04.860
here's the problem.
How can you test that?
You can test,
you can test,

2037
01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.380
you can test for plastics,
plastics in the blood.

2038
01:56:07.381 --> 01:56:11.010
There's residue or you're talking about microscopic amounts of residue from the

2039
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:15.240
plastic.
Now you're testing for fucking plastics.
Now you're testing for plastics,

2040
01:56:15.241 --> 01:56:19.410
which apparently the reason this all came out as the plastics can mask.

2041
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:20.910
Apparently according to this medic,

2042
01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:24.960
the plastics themselves I guess can mask whether or not you've been blood doping

2043
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:29.340
or there are similar compounds in there and it makes it harder to test and that

2044
01:56:29.341 --> 01:56:31.980
that's what I was interested in.
You might be true.

2045
01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:36.750
What I'd heard was that the plastics was how they test for blood doping because

2046
01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:40.700
if they,
if they test your blood and your blood has traces,

2047
01:56:40.701 --> 01:56:44.280
I was plastic and it means you might've taken bags of blood and put them back.

2048
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.590
That doesn't hold water either though,
because then you could just say,
I was,

2049
01:56:46.591 --> 01:56:49.860
I was doing what everybody else does,
which is an ivy.
I was rehydrating Ivy.

2050
01:56:49.890 --> 01:56:52.410
You can't do it.
I'm saying before that.
Right.
So before that,

2051
01:56:52.411 --> 01:56:54.960
they didn't test for it before that this is the first time they've ever tested

2052
01:56:54.961 --> 01:56:58.500
for these plastics and because it was the first time they've had I ivs had been

2053
01:56:58.501 --> 01:57:02.510
used not just openly,
but I mean they'd talk about,

2054
01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:04.410
yes it does.
Yes.

2055
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.420
It's healthier for the fucking fighters.
It's dangerous to not ivy.
Right,

2056
01:57:09.421 --> 01:57:11.250
but is it look book Bj Penn,

2057
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.880
he says ivs are for wimps and he wrote Hashtag beer and hot dogs.

2058
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:16.450
He's never sucked though.
Yes,

2059
01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.850
he has one 45 then Bj Penn is,
look at that.

2060
01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.630
He's not that tall.
Bj also fosters a different time though.

2061
01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.470
It's a little different now.
It's guys hard for long more weight than when,
uh,

2062
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:33.870
I still say that the Bj Penn,
that fog Diego Sanchez was one of the best,

2063
01:57:33.871 --> 01:57:37.920
if not the best,
155 pounds that ever walked the fucking face of the planet.

2064
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:41.410
I agree in,
didn't use an ivy.
I understand that.
Guess what?

2065
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:46.380
Guess what Bj Penn walks around I not heavier than one 70,
from what I've seen.

2066
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.730
No,
no,
you're right.
Let's just be smaller than Conor McGregor.
Yeah.

2067
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:50.970
It's not a huge weight cut.

2068
01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:55.110
Any fought Liotta Machida at heavyweight saying is such a Badass.

2069
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.630
Bj Penn,
such a legend,

2070
01:57:58.850 --> 01:58:02.850
one of the nicest guy ever.
Best.
He's awesome.
And unless you fuck with them,

2071
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.793
fuck with them and go with them.

2072
01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:08.160
It's wrong to be with the fuck would I remember when Doug Davidoff and I met him

2073
01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:12.060
at this premiere.
Oh,
wait a minute.
The Ivy band,
somebody just tweeted me this.

2074
01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:15.750
The Ivy band has been pushed til October.
Oh,
snap.

2075
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:19.980
Sung the back ivy band for UFC fighters until October.

2076
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:23.940
Concerns over dangerous weight cuts and improper rehydration.

2077
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:28.941
The short term have won out over the u s a DA's desire to get rid of ivy usage

2078
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:33.840
fighters are now have a three month grace period to adjust.
Yeah.

2079
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:36.210
There's an argument that they shouldn't do this.
I agree.

2080
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:40.260
I'm not going to pay out of my you go pod or decal.
Thank you to Dan Worms.

2081
01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:44.980
Dan On Twitter for sending me that information.

2082
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:48.410
Yeah.
This is um,
interesting times changing.

2083
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:51.250
Interesting to the reason they postpone is what I heard is there's a lot of

2084
01:58:51.251 --> 01:58:53.200
pushback,
right?
Like lung fighters like Whoa,

2085
01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:55.600
this is too short notice man doctors as well,

2086
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:59.290
including the UFC doctor who makes these rules.

2087
01:58:59.291 --> 01:59:02.340
People that have never fought or cut weight before really.
Exactly.

2088
01:59:02.341 --> 01:59:05.740
In the octagon,
but you can't do this.
Okay.
How many fights you've been in?

2089
01:59:05.741 --> 01:59:08.560
Shut your fucking mouth.
Yeah.
I don't know what they're thinking,
man.

2090
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:10.990
With all this bringing these people in to,

2091
01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:14.320
I mean I guess the idea is to try to clean up the sport,
but for short,

2092
01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:17.530
short term,
it could be devastating.
Horribly devastating.

2093
01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:22.300
The thing is is to my understanding,
they say they test five,

2094
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.980
five times out of out of competition.
Random lead.

2095
01:59:24.981 --> 01:59:29.830
Right now that's just five clients year five random guys a year.

2096
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:32.380
Yeah.
That's not fun.
Every fighter's tested five times.

2097
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:34.690
Every fighter's tested five times a year.
I don't think so.

2098
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.000
I think it's five random.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Every fight or fight,

2099
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.950
every fighter on the roster is going to be tested five times randomly a year.

2100
01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:44.040
Are you sure?
Cause they told me otherwise.
Uh,

2101
01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:46.750
Dominick Cruz told me otherwise while Dominic may be right,

2102
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:49.140
but I don't think he is.
Every fighter on Yoast.

2103
01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:53.800
Every fighter in the UFC roster tested five times a year,
which is ridiculous.

2104
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:58.300
Yeah,
I think that's exactly it.
I,
but then that's what in Dominic's like,
no man,

2105
01:59:58.301 --> 02:00:02.770
it's five,
five fighters randomly.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's stupid.

2106
02:00:02.970 --> 02:00:07.870
They can test anyone.
Revamped UFC drug policy include,

2107
02:00:07.871 --> 02:00:11.830
here it is,
includes random year round testing,

2108
02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:16.330
two year suspension for first time offenders,
Doo Doo,
Doo Doo Doo,
Doo Doo.

2109
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.380
Let's see,
a first offense.
Okay.
When are they going to test?

2110
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:25.240
Or is it five telling me?
See,
I thought everyone is,

2111
02:00:25.570 --> 02:00:27.730
could be tested,
but they're not guaranteed.

2112
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:32.110
Each individual tested five times throughout the year.
Yeah.
I don't know,
ma'am.

2113
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:36.850
Let have any test that is so what?
There's 705 well,
that's the whole idea.

2114
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:42.730
Uh,
yeah.
No,
every fight or five times a year,
man.
Yeah,
sure.
Save money on tests.

2115
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:45.390
Give it to the fighters and sponsorship.
I got to take them.
No,

2116
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.770
they're not going to save the money for the fighters.
Started to go to the chest,

2117
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:55.930
randomly test all 500 athletes several times a year.
We're sending a message.

2118
02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.720
If you're cheating,
you'll get caught,
suspended and fine.

2119
02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:02.170
We want the sport to be clean.
Hmm.
Yeah.

2120
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:08.530
Yeah.
I don't know,
man.
You know,
I don't know what to say.
It's all a I,

2121
02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.150
in a way,
I feel like science is,

2122
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:16.300
they're not on the side of time and technological advancement and it's going to

2123
02:01:16.301 --> 02:01:20.260
be very tough because I feel like science is always gonna find a way to beat any

2124
02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.460
kind of test.
Testing is always behind.
I'm not saying it's an excuse,

2125
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:28.990
but I'm just saying it's gonna be interesting to see how now scientists who are

2126
02:01:28.991 --> 02:01:33.820
involved in the fight game and fighters figure out a way around this testing

2127
02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:36.610
five times here.
Very difficult,
but something like,
well,

2128
02:01:36.611 --> 02:01:40.190
it'll be a battle between the cheaters and the detectors because the,

2129
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.930
<v 0>the science involved in detecting is getting better as well.
So it's weird,
man.</v>

2130
02:01:44.931 --> 02:01:48.840
It's like this a battle between cheaters and an [inaudible] account.

2131
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:53.860
Many guys like just just snuck under the wire and retired before it all ended in

2132
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:58.150
college.
I would imagine a lot when you love to go change in their bodies.

2133
02:01:58.210 --> 02:02:00.820
Randy coture was in his forties and it was beating the shit if you,

2134
02:02:00.821 --> 02:02:02.600
when you a little bit to kind of look at his blood work.

2135
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:04.640
When we got going on here,
Fella,
he kind of was,

2136
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:08.680
he was kind of open about being on TRT I think later on somewhere,
right?

2137
02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.010
I don't believe he was.
I thought he was like,

2138
02:02:10.011 --> 02:02:13.760
I thought it was kind of known when he was 45 is doing some testosterone.
No,
no,

2139
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:19.040
no.
I think it was all just speculation.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I think,
um,
but again,

2140
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:22.490
I don't know how you'd do it without what Tatra training three times a day.

2141
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:23.690
Wrestling,
kicking.

2142
02:02:23.691 --> 02:02:28.310
Good luck with [inaudible] to do bloodwork on Herschel Walker when Herschel

2143
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:31.540
Walker was 48 and he fought in Strikeforce and was built like a brick shit house

2144
02:02:31.541 --> 02:02:33.600
freak though.
He's such an uh,

2145
02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:38.570
a 1% or for so long in the NFL before in college they were like,
what?

2146
02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:43.150
He's a 1% or of 1% and 45 with world class speed outlier.
Total out.

2147
02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.690
Just like a Bo Jackson.
Yeah,
exactly.
Anything like that.
Yeah.

2148
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.730
Every now and then you'll get one of those dudes didn't even lift,

2149
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:52.010
just had crazy regimen exercise regimen,

2150
02:02:52.011 --> 02:02:54.920
but just body weight stuff and a thousand pushups a day,

2151
02:02:54.921 --> 02:02:59.600
a thousand sit ups a day.
Weird,
weird stuff.
It was a religion for him.

2152
02:02:59.601 --> 02:03:02.960
He never went out and drank.
He had,
they did a really interesting profile on him.

2153
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:06.190
Well there was other guys that were like that too.
I mean there's,

2154
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:07.970
there's always a few guys that just,

2155
02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:11.120
we'll work harder than anybody else on top of the fact that they're just

2156
02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:15.530
absolute freak athletes.
And that's like a Herschel Walker Brian,
same way.

2157
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.870
Nobody has his work ethic.
It's weird.
His work at Toby Bryant?
Yeah.
Oh,

2158
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.380
the craziest thing in the world.
Nothing better.

2159
02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.430
Michael Jordan and Floyd Mayweather.

2160
02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:25.520
Floyd Mayweather is so obsessed with training.

2161
02:03:25.521 --> 02:03:27.570
He'll wake up at three in the morning and make everybody come to the gym,

2162
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:31.760
come home and be to show his wife just read thing.
I mean it's ridiculous man.

2163
02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.450
This training was more of a choker.
No,
no,

2164
02:03:35.451 --> 02:03:38.770
he doesn't like EFC hits her on top of the head.
So you can't see.

2165
02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.100
That's interesting because you have to shave her head to prove the weld cheese

2166
02:03:42.101 --> 02:03:46.790
as well.
That's smart.
Jesus.
He's
smart.
You know what you do?

2167
02:03:46.791 --> 02:03:50.730
You open hand loans.
Well,
I'm going to give advice.
What's that?

2168
02:03:50.731 --> 02:03:54.460
What's that movie Travis Browne Song.
People listen.
Do what

2169
02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:59.450
now?
Now do I hit him with the liver or nobody?

2170
02:03:59.490 --> 02:04:02.480
Pullovers husbands like keep going,
Joe,
to remember that during that movie,

2171
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:03.440
the grifters,

2172
02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:08.570
when the guys takes out a pillowcase and he starts putting oranges in pillowcase

2173
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.470
and he goes,
you know what,
I'm doing this and Angelica Houston does.

2174
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:15.950
She can hit me.
When you hit somebody with it,
pillowcase with aren't just test.

2175
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:20.420
It doesn't create any PR PR who sees and she knows he's going to take a

2176
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:24.130
pillowcase with RMG.
That's true.
That's the movies.

2177
02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:27.410
Okay for the Lord has taken you in the facial.
Y'All fuck yeah,

2178
02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:30.980
you're going to blind eyes would be swollen.
She's going to hit her in the body.

2179
02:04:30.981 --> 02:04:35.750
And I remember going,
God damn,
that's terrible.
[inaudible] who wrote a movie?

2180
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:40.760
Obey man's never beaten guys standing ivy.
Awful.
I was like,

2181
02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:43.970
that's how horrible a pillow case with art just,

2182
02:04:43.971 --> 02:04:45.690
and I'm gonna beat the fuck out of you with it.

2183
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:50.400
It's like the woman who killed a man would be frozen with frozen leg lamb,

2184
02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:54.300
a lamb of a leg of lamb.
So she took out a frozen leg of lamb,

2185
02:04:54.450 --> 02:04:59.330
bashed him in the fucking head,
and then cooked it and ate it.
Fed Her.

2186
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:00.990
And her kids,
you know,
he was a,

2187
02:05:00.991 --> 02:05:04.020
I think apparently he was at the table and she took it and just crack them in

2188
02:05:04.021 --> 02:05:08.760
the back of the head and bludgeoned to death with a leg of lamb and then cooked

2189
02:05:08.761 --> 02:05:11.190
it.
And where this happened,
it's a long time ago.

2190
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:14.650
I think it was an econ was nothing.
Yeah,
England,
England,
England.
That's fun.

2191
02:05:14.651 --> 02:05:19.100
He'd say Scotland.
Yeah.
He says crazy,
right?
People killed people with everything.

2192
02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:22.590
Come up with all kinds of boards.
Sure.
People kill people.
You can think of it.

2193
02:05:22.591 --> 02:05:25.140
It's happened.
Do you want to get rid of the body?
That's why that they,

2194
02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:28.960
they say the mafia is to Fiji to pigs because they'll eat everything coming

2195
02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:32.520
ahead.
Does that Mexican cartel guy,
I forget the name for it,

2196
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:36.480
but in Spanish it means,
uh,
like Porch Stu.
Cause he would have this vat,

2197
02:05:36.481 --> 02:05:40.140
we'd put the bodies in.
Well acid,
they use acid.
That's a true,

2198
02:05:40.141 --> 02:05:43.530
they talked about this guy who,
he was involved in horse racing.

2199
02:05:43.531 --> 02:05:47.190
They turned out to be a member of the Zetas cartel or what was that?

2200
02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:50.070
Remember that those guys were really all but one of them for sure.

2201
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:50.933
And he used to,

2202
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:55.130
he was a big and the horse racing thing and one of the testimonies was that the

2203
02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:58.860
guy,
he brought him out to talk to them cause they were just a little suspicious.

2204
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:04.110
And another guy was walked out and he had a blindfold on and they just shot him.

2205
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:05.150
They do a Holler if is that.

2206
02:06:05.151 --> 02:06:09.600
We had to do boom shot him and put him in acid and they go look,

2207
02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:12.540
so we want to talk to you.
Sorry about that.
And the guy starts throwing up,

2208
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:16.450
you know,
and just terrified and goes,
sorry,
we as in nasty business.
But anyways,

2209
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:20.120
he's gone now just boiling away and acid just disappearing.
And he goes,

2210
02:06:20.121 --> 02:06:24.600
so we had to talk.
There's a rumor apparently that you're talking to cops.

2211
02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:28.290
I know that's not true personally.
I know.
I just wanted you to know that.

2212
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:32.630
I know it's not true anyway.
You want some,
you want to grab a beer.
That's,

2213
02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:36.180
that's how,
that's how they would kind of let you know.
By the way,

2214
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:40.170
that if there's any question,
you'll be in that Vat.
Oh,
acid.
Yeah.

2215
02:06:40.171 --> 02:06:42.660
You might want to start planning your trip to Costa Rica.

2216
02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:46.560
You might want to fucking get some fucking plane ticket to Canada when the,

2217
02:06:46.561 --> 02:06:48.990
when the feds come to talk to you and they say they're going to protect you,

2218
02:06:48.991 --> 02:06:53.100
you might want it.
Finland's a good spot fuck out of him.
I mean,

2219
02:06:53.101 --> 02:06:56.330
how much easier was it to get away with crime back in the day then?
Now,
man,

2220
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:59.220
Oh man,
I can't do shit now.
You can do anything.

2221
02:06:59.390 --> 02:07:03.510
They didn't even have technology.
Yeah,
man.
And that fingerprint.

2222
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:07.110
I was watching a documentary on the mobsters,
like the American mob,

2223
02:07:07.111 --> 02:07:08.730
which started in New York and all those guys,

2224
02:07:08.731 --> 02:07:11.160
and you look at the whole setup they had.
It's like,
God,

2225
02:07:11.161 --> 02:07:13.920
these days you're not doing that.
You know what,
man?
I talked to somebody,

2226
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:15.570
I talked to some Philly detectives,

2227
02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:19.320
like to longtime veteran detectives in Philadelphia.

2228
02:07:19.321 --> 02:07:23.010
I spent a lot of time with him and I said,
Oh,
you know,
he said,
we don't rely,

2229
02:07:23.011 --> 02:07:24.780
you'd be amazed at how we don't rely.

2230
02:07:24.781 --> 02:07:27.480
A lot of times on forensics and fingerprints.
He said,

2231
02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.820
when you're investigating a murder,
they were homicide in Texas.
He said,

2232
02:07:29.821 --> 02:07:33.570
when you're investigating a murder,
you have to realize most people confess.

2233
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:35.560
Once you get them in questioning,

2234
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:36.880
<v 2>that you're,</v>

2235
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:40.450
what you're dealing with is they know in their hearts they've been raised.

2236
02:07:40.451 --> 02:07:41.590
Even if you're a sociopath,

2237
02:07:41.591 --> 02:07:43.810
you've been raised from a very young age to believe this,

2238
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:47.380
to know that this is the ultimate crime.
You took another life.

2239
02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:51.970
And by the time you get them in there and you know how to properly interrogate

2240
02:07:51.971 --> 02:07:54.820
somebody and really ask them questions and more importantly,

2241
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:58.540
get them on your side.
Just go listen dude.
Listen.

2242
02:07:58.990 --> 02:08:00.490
Everybody does crazy shit.

2243
02:08:00.491 --> 02:08:05.290
Once in a while there's a Radiolab podcast about that guy that was a very

2244
02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:08.590
prolific serial killer in the Pacific northwest with the river killer,

2245
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:12.460
was a green,
green river killer and Seattle,
I think he was,
uh,

2246
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:16.130
he was,
uh,
committing necrophilia yeah.

2247
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:18.820
On a lot of these girls and they had to get them to admit it.

2248
02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:23.740
So they talked to this guy and the guy who was the interrogator,

2249
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.170
he talked to him for six months.

2250
02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.660
Every day he would sit down with this guy for six months.

2251
02:08:28.661 --> 02:08:30.520
They were trying to figure out what the fuck the guy did.

2252
02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:34.330
And then slowly but surely over the course of this six months,

2253
02:08:34.331 --> 02:08:38.430
the dude's slowly started admitting all the different things that he did and

2254
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:42.570
admitted why he did it and admitted he did it just because he enjoyed it for a

2255
02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:45.850
while.
You know,
he tried to say that the girl pissed him off and this thing goes,

2256
02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:51.120
did you enter into this knowing that she could make you upset and that you would

2257
02:08:51.221 --> 02:08:55.210
wind up killing her?
And he goes,
yes.
Yeah,
I did.
I did.
Well,
why'd you do it?

2258
02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:59.110
Cause I just,
I had to do it.
How to kill Richard.
Richard Walter,

2259
02:08:59.111 --> 02:09:01.360
who's an incredible profile or said they,

2260
02:09:01.361 --> 02:09:03.940
I think it was like the green river killer,

2261
02:09:03.941 --> 02:09:08.680
but the guy was clearly killing women and he said to the cops,
he said,

2262
02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:12.940
he said,
just just put a stake out at this site.

2263
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.780
You will find him in his car.
He will be jerking off.
You'll find him.

2264
02:09:16.781 --> 02:09:20.800
He'll come back to the site and he masturbates here and thinks about what he
did.

2265
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:23.560
Sure enough,
that's how they caught him.
They see,

2266
02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:26.710
they see a guy jerking off his car looking down right down where he buried the

2267
02:09:26.711 --> 02:09:31.140
body jacket.
Hi Buddy.
Want to talk to you?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
We know,

2268
02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:35.080
and then they come in and that's,
there are,
there are behaviors.
This book,

2269
02:09:35.081 --> 02:09:37.660
the murder room is so fucking incredible.
This guy,
Richard Walter,

2270
02:09:37.661 --> 02:09:42.661
there are behaviors that people do like certain guys will rape and kill a woman,

2271
02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:45.550
but when they're raping her,
if she dies in the process,

2272
02:09:45.551 --> 02:09:47.980
they'll stop immediately because they don't want the cops to think they're

2273
02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:51.340
freaks.
All kinds of weird shit like that.

2274
02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:53.050
That was the thing of what this green river guys,

2275
02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:55.420
and he didn't want them to know that he fucked them after they were.

2276
02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:55.960
That's right.

2277
02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:59.740
He didn't want to admit it because he had an ego and ego and the guy in the way

2278
02:09:59.741 --> 02:10:02.200
he got them to do it.
He goes,
look,
you wouldn't be the first guy.

2279
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:05.020
A lot of guys who've done that's right.
He's like,
oh,
okay.
Yeah,

2280
02:10:05.021 --> 02:10:09.820
he will tell you I actually,
I did do that and I didn't do that.
They used to,

2281
02:10:09.850 --> 02:10:10.683
they got a guy,

2282
02:10:10.690 --> 02:10:15.690
I'm a high level terrorist who had never seen porn and they started showing him

2283
02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:20.600
porn.
Oh.
And I said,
and he,
it was like the carrot and the stick and he was like,

2284
02:10:20.601 --> 02:10:21.940
Hey,
do you want to see more of this?

2285
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:23.800
We'll show you what the hell she tellers scene.

2286
02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:26.400
And he started talking just to see it.
No,
he was a,

2287
02:10:26.410 --> 02:10:29.760
he became up in a very strict Islamic society.
So there's showed them some dicks.

2288
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:34.130
Lucky.
Do you want to know these really hot girls?
You

2289
02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:39.140
<v 0>can

Bella,
Donna and I said,

2290
02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:41.810
we'll get you talking if you have a stone and we'll get you throwing up.

2291
02:10:41.811 --> 02:10:43.100

She's all right.

2296
02:10:59.230 --> 02:11:03.350
Smart wouldn't go with fucking great greats in 10th grade.

2297
02:11:03.370 --> 02:11:07.250
Might be a little intense to be a little hyperbole there.

2298
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:11.500
May never seen one of our parents.
How about that?

2303
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:30.920
She said her skin was bad because she was taken in her and Tom said,

2304
02:11:30.921 --> 02:11:34.340
I think you're taking in too much testosterone.
Too many loads.
Yeah.

2305
02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:37.310
She's scratching a,
you got a whore on your hands.

2306
02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:43.140
You imagine if you take it,
somebody loads it.

2307
02:11:43.141 --> 02:11:46.370
It changes your biological profile.
Imagine if you're just dating a girl.

2308

She had cut my fucking face.

unless I'm fighting.
Yeah.

2312
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.100
I've never had that noise because there's some hot about that though.

2313
02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.790
I would agree with you with asa.

All right.
And I'm talking for her.

2341

02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:22.440
It's so cool to see so many people that have great podcasts now.

This isn't the best times ever for like listening to shit.

2352
02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:44.970
these are weird,
man.
That's a,
that's an interview you're prepared for.
He wasn't,

2353
02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:47.820
you could tell he was nervous.
Oh,
well how do you not be?
No,

2354
02:14:47.821 --> 02:14:50.250
I'm just saying you could get like,

It's in his garage,

2355
02:14:50.251 --> 02:14:54.260
leader of the free world,
but he has,
he has a,
Obama said,
you know,

2356
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:57.990
do you get nervous to do this stuff?
Obama basically was like,
I'm in your garage.

2357
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.950
I'm not getting nervous.

2358
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:04.710
I've talked to bigger crowds when he did a garage.
I did between two ferns,

2359
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:08.440
Zach Galifianakis.
I was a man.
He did and he was funny.
He,
yes,
yes.

2360
02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:12.060
And he was really funny.
Wow,
this is awesome.
Yeah,

2361
02:15:12.061 --> 02:15:15.630
it's actually always been the funniest dude you said on a recent podcast that

2362
02:15:15.631 --> 02:15:18.430
you think Kevin Hart's the biggest comedian ever all time.
Yeah.

2363
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:21.510
I think he's the biggest in the United States.
Big to Eddie Murphy.
Yeah.
Oh,

2364
02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:23.010
definitely.
Definitely.
He is.

2365
02:15:23.011 --> 02:15:25.560
He's bigger and bigger as far as like what he could do,

2366
02:15:25.561 --> 02:15:26.700
like arenas and stuff like that.

2367
02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:29.400
But Russell Peters is the biggest internationally,

2368
02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:32.190
so it's like Kevin Hart is the biggest in America,

2369
02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:36.610
but Russell Peters sells out the o two arena.
Yeah,
he's getting,

2370
02:15:36.630 --> 02:15:38.580
he's great.
And Russell is just a great guy.

2371
02:15:38.581 --> 02:15:41.700
Russell hosted last night at the Ice House in Pasadena.

2372
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:43.210
That's how humble I show it.
The Ice House.

2373
02:15:43.530 --> 02:15:45.720
I called him and I asked her if you want to do it.
He goes,
yeah,
fuck yeah.

2374
02:15:45.721 --> 02:15:48.540
He goes,
can I host?
And I'm like,
you can do whatever you want,
so hum.

2375
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:51.960
You fucked my wife.
Like you can take a shower,
do whatever you want.
Man.

2376
02:15:52.590 --> 02:15:55.800
You're Russell Peters,
truly humble and he's such a funny dude.

2377
02:15:56.730 --> 02:15:58.680
Give me a Breitling.
Wow.

He goes,

2379
02:16:04.810 --> 02:16:08.070
takes it off and he puts it on me.
I go,
I can't take your watch.
And he goes,

2380
02:16:08.071 --> 02:16:10.970
come on and take my fucking watch dance the best.
Was he the coolest guy ever?

2381
02:16:10.971 --> 02:16:14.460
Yeah,
he is one of the nicest human beings I've ever met.
Her met life,

2382
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:16.650
couldn't be more supportive of comics,

2383
02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:21.120
couldn't be more generous with like taking guys in the road with them promoting

2384
02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:22.260
guys because some guys out,

2385
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:24.360
everything about them is great and that's one of the reasons why it's so

2386
02:16:24.361 --> 02:16:26.710
successful.
It's a fight game.
Jujitsu,
boxing,

2387
02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:30.570
you think he's bigger than Kevin Hart?
Internationally International,
yes,

2388
02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:32.770
but Kevin Hart's bigger in the United States.
He's so big.

2389
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:36.160
Kevin Hart is so talented for me.
Like I,
he's one of these guys,

2390
02:16:36.161 --> 02:16:38.650
I've worked with him twice and he makes me laugh.

2391
02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:42.790
He's always making people laugh.
He's very,
very funny.
But another generous guy,

2392
02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:46.470
very generous.
It's super motivated,
like crazy work ethic,
right?
Oh,

2393
02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:48.790
I love his work ethic.
I would go with his Instagram.

2394
02:16:48.791 --> 02:16:51.490
He's always working out and do it.
All kinds of crazy shit.
He,

2395
02:16:51.491 --> 02:16:53.860

He's like in the trailer,

2396

2398
02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:02.050
he did a concert last night in front of like fucking 30,000 people.

2399
02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:05.800
Now he's on the movie set all the other people in his trailer or fallen asleep

2400
02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:08.440
and he's like,

Look at my trainer.
My trainer has fallen asleep

but he's a bad,
never stops.
He never stops writing.

2402
02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:17.470
The one thing that I've seen,
especially with Comedians,

2403
02:17:17.471 --> 02:17:20.560

To create material.
Yeah.
To,

2405
02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.500
to create new material all the time.
Gone through that.
You have to,

2406
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:29.440
you have to constantly be on stage.
You have to constantly be writing.

2407
02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.600
You have to constantly be thinking,
Madison Square Garden.

2408
02:17:31.601 --> 02:17:36.210
He's sold out three shows.
Dude.

2409

02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.510
he's a comedic scroll down so you could see that better.

2412
02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:50.530
Scroll the call like with a gold Mike.
They won't let you scroll down the mall.

2413
02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:54.250
No Damn.
Look at this.
Oh,

That's the image.
That's insane.

2414
02:17:54.251 --> 02:17:57.070
He's got a gold Mike.
Oh my God.
What's it called?
Micro mother fucker.

2415
02:17:57.220 --> 02:18:00.340
Who uses a gold microphone.
That's why not.
Why wouldn't they?

2416
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:04.090
Why would you want a silver one?
He's always been,
he's such a generous person.

2417
02:18:04.091 --> 02:18:07.060
He's such a good guy.
Well,
I'm eight.
I told you I met him.

2418
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:10.560
We was with his kids and his girlfriend wants.
I ran into him.
He was like,

2419
02:18:10.561 --> 02:18:13.660

I'd never met him before,
but I met him.

2420
02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:15.640
He immediately gives me a giant hug.

2421
02:18:15.641 --> 02:18:20.140
Super price could have been almost as big as him if certain things would of went

2422
02:18:20.141 --> 02:18:23.230
its way.
Dave Chappelle,
Dave Chappelle at the time was fucking gay.

2423
02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:26.800
He still could be.
He still could be if you want it to.
Dave Chappelle's d yeah,

2424
02:18:26.801 --> 02:18:29.620
absolutely.
Dave Chappelle's is different at different animals,
different animals.

2425
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.100
Dave Chappelle likes to show up with a fucking microphone and a speaker and do a

2426
02:18:33.101 --> 02:18:37.600
show in a park like he's done since he was 17 he's a monster.

2427
02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:41.080
He's a very,
very,
very,
very funny man.
Super talented.

2428
02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.330
And he's still in his show.

2429
02:18:43.330 --> 02:18:46.140
The Chappelle show was huge and then he just disappeared.
Right?

2430
02:18:46.141 --> 02:18:47.590
Cause he didn't like the way things were going.

2431
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:51.820
Well they down to get him to listen to them and do their,

2432
02:18:51.821 --> 02:18:55.620
show him their way and they wanted him to stop saying the n word.

2433
02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:58.730
There was all sorts of shit was going on.
They were,
you know,

2434
02:18:59.090 --> 02:19:03.100
they had a big DVD deal on the table.
There was like $50 million and he was like,

2435
02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:06.220
you know what,
I'm going to do whatever I want to do,
so fuck off.

2436
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:10.120
And just went to Africa.
You know,
I think both his parents are professors,

2437
02:19:10.121 --> 02:19:15.010
aren't they?
I don't know.
But I know,
you know,
still to this day he's doing great.

2438
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:19.840
You know,
it's not sure,
but he,
he's not the guy like on his own time,
Kevin Hart,

2439
02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:23.110
guy smoked cigarettes,
he believes in conspiracy theories.

2440
02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:28.250
Like he works out a little bit but he's not the kind of healthy that Hart Kevin

2441
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:28.250
Hart

2442
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:29.810
<v 0>is like,
he's going to be like Oprah.</v>

2443
02:19:29.811 --> 02:19:32.780
I watched Kevin Hart wrestle with Laurence Fishburne.
They,

2444
02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:34.220
we shot the scene where he was,

2445
02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:38.690
he had to basically have a fight with you want to talk about athletic and

2446
02:19:38.691 --> 02:19:41.600
explosive.
He might be five,
four but I've never,
he was,

2447
02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:44.240
we were all going look it out fucking fast.

2448
02:19:44.241 --> 02:19:48.260
He moves and he was doing a comedically like gone under his legs and Lawrence is

2449
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:49.820
a big guy and it was just like,

2450
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:53.480
I was kind of taken aback with just how long he was able to keep that shit up.

2451
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:58.220
Doing his own stunts,
jumping through the hair.
[inaudible] exit fucking fit man.

2452
02:19:58.250 --> 02:20:01.070
Well here's videos who puts on Instagram of him working on every morning and he

2453
02:20:01.071 --> 02:20:05.360
does crazy shit.
Like which lines she would ditch the workout gloves though.

2454
02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:07.300
He's loves to workout clothes,

2455
02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:11.990
but the a lot of guys don't want to have had when he squats like Bro.
Oh really?

2456
02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:14.510
Hey Man.
It's tough man.
A lot of guys don't everything again though.

2457
02:20:14.511 --> 02:20:17.660
You know it's not a prolapse that take it easy.
Just say you want to use a bar,

2458
02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:22.130
a bar on your big back had,
did you say pad?
I'm a boss.
I mean a pad.
A pad.

2459
02:20:22.131 --> 02:20:24.920
You don't use a patent on the bar and she's never really sun.

2460
02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:28.190
You put that fucking bar and your back and just squat.
Can't do that man.

2461
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:30.980
You like get,
yeah,
you just can't do that.
It's not loud man.

2462
02:20:30.981 --> 02:20:35.660
The fuck up Brian counts dude.
I use gloves on.
Do you phone?
I don't use Chyna.

2463
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:39.140
I don't use gloves.
I should maybe cause I do a lot more

2464
02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:44.660
oil.
You guys.
I'm on.
I dead lift though.
It dead lift without.

2465
02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:49.250
I'm going to use gloves from the dead.
Are raised as you saw yesterday.
Yes I did.

2466
02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:52.220
Did you get hit in the head?
I was probably somebody who wasn't,

2467
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:56.930
wasn't mobile and get,
I didn't get hidden that you didn't get hit once.

2468
02:20:56.931 --> 02:20:57.910
Now I have a hard time.

2469
02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:01.850
Barb Wayne the night did it before and Wayne did hit me in my face once with

2470
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:04.730
Sparta guy.
So shitty.
He didn't land one shot.

2471
02:21:04.810 --> 02:21:08.890
He a Jones jr bully Travis Browne.
He's,

2472
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.330
he probably is not the most athletic guy.
That's correct.

2473
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:16.331
And so I did not get who use barring whoever guy counting Wayne puts me in with

2474
02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:19.130
their different dudes and that,
you know,

2475
02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:23.600
and you swore the shit guy from million dollar baby,
I don't want to talk badly.

2476
02:21:23.601 --> 02:21:26.810
I'm good.
If you don't mind.
Can you give a touch?
She's keeping it.
No,
he did not.

2477
02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:29.570
Can You keep your references?
So next time you saw him you need to say,
Hey,

2478
02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:32.590
I'm gonna go beat this kid.
I've been spine with Wayne who,
you know,

2479
02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:34.270
and he was fine with what,

2480
02:21:34.271 --> 02:21:38.420
I know that I'm just saying that he throws punches at me and I'm learning how to

2481
02:21:38.421 --> 02:21:43.421
move and explaining to the guy who was not call a multiple time world boxing

2482
02:21:43.701 --> 02:21:47.000
champion.
One of the great men,
I,
one of my favorite people in the world.

2483
02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:50.750
And I trained with him all the time because I chance I get to train with them

2484
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:53.480
and he'll,
he teaches me the way you're probably supposed to teach,

2485
02:21:53.481 --> 02:21:57.290
which is he'll throw shots at me,
not full obviously,

2486
02:21:57.530 --> 02:22:00.470
but you learn a little bit of how to move if you're working with a guy that good

2487
02:22:00.471 --> 02:22:01.880
and then you get it with a guy who is not good,

2488
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:02.990
you're gonna be able to move a little better.

2489
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.770
And you see that he's involved in that semi colon thing where you get tattooed

2490
02:22:06.771 --> 02:22:10.220
like a semi colon on your arm to like to say,

2491
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:14.420
to let you know that like,
life's not over.
There's more to go.

2492
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:18.950
I don't know the story.
I talked to him about that depression movement thing.

2493
02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:22.490
Well,
I'm not,
well,
he dealt with some stuff.
I don't know how vocal he is,

2494
02:22:22.491 --> 02:22:26.100
but I know being a fighter and having 350 fights mean he,
maybe he

2495
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:28.820
<v 2>had,
I don't want to speak out of turn,
but I know,
uh,</v>

2496
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:32.470
he's been maybe involved in some of that stuff.
Um,
but anyway,

2497
02:22:32.490 --> 02:22:36.060
so they get these tattoos and say they beat depression dot with a comma on it,

2498
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:37.050
you know,
semi-colon.
Yeah.

2499
02:22:37.390 --> 02:22:40.800
Which indicates there's more to come in the sentence like you don't end a

2500
02:22:40.801 --> 02:22:42.770
sentence with that.
There's more to come.
You know,

2501
02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:46.740
it's absolutely dumb about that.
But he's just one of those guys.
Instagram.
Okay.

2502
02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:48.870
Yeah.
So he's one of those dudes.

2503
02:22:48.871 --> 02:22:53.190
I love being around because he's just such a humble motherfucker.

2504
02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:57.090
Such a nice guy and,
and it's like you're going to teach me and he really like,

2505
02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:00.000
he really like no matter when,
where he's always there,

2506
02:23:00.001 --> 02:23:03.420
always present and just such a fucking amazing,
I'm Gregor loves,

2507
02:23:03.421 --> 02:23:06.270
I gave him a hug on his way to the aisle.
Oh yeah.
I can send her out.

2508
02:23:06.271 --> 02:23:08.960
He's a legend in Ireland.
Super Legend Rock.

2509
02:23:08.961 --> 02:23:12.780
Him and Barry McGuigan are the two biggest boxers from Ireland.
Pretty much.

2510
02:23:12.781 --> 02:23:14.550
Everyone's well,
I'm,
I'm,
I like,

2511
02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:18.190
I'm always so flattered that I even get to train with someone like that.
Yeah,

2512
02:23:18.191 --> 02:23:19.740
but you said it's bar with them.
Well,

2513
02:23:19.741 --> 02:23:21.780
what I'm saying is that he'll move around and punch me,

2514
02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:24.990
punch me in the face if I don't have my hands up,
what we do,
spar,

2515
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.080
he puts on headgear and he puts on her own name will go,
you know,
and,

2516
02:23:28.090 --> 02:23:31.110
and you know,
he's not opening up on me.
He's not trying to kill you,

2517
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:34.200
but he goes hit.
But you learn.
And when you do that with someone like that,

2518
02:23:34.470 --> 02:23:37.070
and then you go with somebody who's not,
you know,

2519
02:23:37.170 --> 02:23:39.120
close to that you can get out of the way.
But do you,

2520
02:23:39.121 --> 02:23:41.800
do you have any concern whatsoever about getting punched in the head or just

2521
02:23:41.810 --> 02:23:44.960
because I'm not taking it on my chicken.
I'm not getting punched in the problem.

2522
02:23:44.961 --> 02:23:48.840
But you don't even when Wayne hits you,
that's,
that counts my man.

2523
02:23:48.841 --> 02:23:51.090
It's worth it to me.
It's worth it.
Yeah.
I love,

2524
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:56.100
I love boxing and I love the feeling,
you know,
it was bars a lot.
Lucy Kay.
Really?

2525
02:23:56.130 --> 02:23:58.620
Yeah,
we had a conversation about it.
He goes,
I love it.
I just love it.

2526
02:23:58.920 --> 02:23:59.753
I love doing it.

2527
02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:04.020
But a guys who guys who done also may not be getting again like it's one thing

2528
02:24:04.021 --> 02:24:08.400
to get really hit if you get even a good jab and you got a big headache.

2529
02:24:08.401 --> 02:24:09.151
And that's what I avoid.

2530
02:24:09.151 --> 02:24:12.630
Cause if you're fighting like rocky at the gym who fights a lot and now that kid

2531
02:24:12.631 --> 02:24:16.710
can really hit well and if you well for me,
why is that 185 pounds?

2532
02:24:17.470 --> 02:24:20.430
He was like this,
the thrill is to look,
he loves the thrill,

2533
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:22.620
loves the thrill of sparring.
I just don't get it.

2534
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:24.300
If you're making money off your brain,

2535
02:24:24.301 --> 02:24:27.450
I don't get why you would cause he's not just a language and learning.

2536
02:24:27.451 --> 02:24:31.260
It's really hard to,
it hasn't been a detriment.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2537
02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:33.510
And so he's willing to take the chance for the thrill.

2538
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:34.980
I like it cause it's so hard.

2539
02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.130
I like it because it's close to impossible for to be bold.
The,

2540
02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:43.080
the feeling of being alive and taking any kind of risk and problem solving in a

2541
02:24:43.081 --> 02:24:46.290
very like Gary,
you get it.
You know what I mean?
That's for me what it is,

2542
02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:48.510
problem solving and learning patterns.
And,

2543
02:24:48.810 --> 02:24:51.420
and seeing it actually works sometimes charges you up.

2544
02:24:51.421 --> 02:24:54.690
Like it makes you excited about doing other shit because of that,
you know,

2545
02:24:54.691 --> 02:24:57.720
for a lot of fun.
Peaceful.
Yeah.
100%.
For you,

2546
02:24:57.721 --> 02:24:59.520
it's different because like you were,
first of all,

2547
02:24:59.521 --> 02:25:03.420
at the highest level there is professional UFC and you're sparring with guys

2548
02:25:03.421 --> 02:25:08.040
like Shane car,
which is not even a little bit fun.
I can't even imagine that.

2549
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.740
I can't imagine you couldn't pay me to go to a boxing gym right now.

2550
02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:14.210
I'll do Jujitsu.
But if you said,
Hey Brendan,
come down here and let's box.
Yeah,

2551
02:25:14.370 --> 02:25:17.730
shout out to box and burn though.
Copay number one gym in California.

2552
02:25:17.731 --> 02:25:22.000
According to men's fitness,
Tony Jeffries and women call it.
Ooh.

2553
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:23.800
Do you guys want to learn boxing?
Ooh,

2554
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.320
<v 0>great place to work out.
Hey,
uh,</v>

2555
02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.360
let's wrap this up cause I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
All right,

2556
02:25:28.390 --> 02:25:32.290
so a big fucking fight this weekend.
Huge fights can be fun.
Come see me.

2557
02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:37.210
Pick your,
pick what happens
on the main event.

2558
02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.020
Mendez Mcgregor.
Come on,
son.
If I'm betting money,
I'm taking Mendez.

2559
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:45.790
My heart says Conor,
Brian Killen I got,
I got Conor Mcgregor.
Really?

2560
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:46.301
I do.

2561
02:25:46.301 --> 02:25:51.301
I think he hits harder than than than people know and realize and can connect.

2562
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:53.230
I think it's going to connect.
I think it's bigger.

2563
02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:57.220
It's a different kind of fighter for Chad Mendez.
I think he's going to,
it's,

2564
02:25:57.490 --> 02:25:59.620
I hope you're right.
We have,
we actually have a bet on it.

2565
02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:03.010
What do teachers sales of July.
That's right.
We had a whole month of tee shirts.

2566
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:06.840
That's right.
That's no pump.
That's the month I'm going to start Instagram in it.

2567
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:11.320
We don't,

2568
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:15.290
we don't drop turbo slot until August to just promise me that knows next week.

2569
02:26:15.291 --> 02:26:16.240
So come on man.

2570
02:26:16.241 --> 02:26:18.670
It was my idea of a sudden terrible sluts going to be a big seller.

2571
02:26:18.690 --> 02:26:22.630
See the conversation was turbo sluts really not worth doing

2572
02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:28.210
Hashtag [inaudible] slide,
but that has a shirt hashtag terrible slut.

2573
02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:32.640
I think Daryl Sal simple.
Keep it simple.
I'm excited about is I,

2574
02:26:32.641 --> 02:26:36.900
but I'd never grow up and it's Peter Pan that looks like Brian Callan.
So fine.

2575
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:39.300
The kid on the back.
I like that.
And then we have done,

2576
02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:43.390
we have a big brown master,
Kim t dropping.
No,
no big brown bear.

2577
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.220
Big Brown star on our song.
Did you,
um,
who do you have in this fight?
Can you say?

2578
02:26:48.610 --> 02:26:53.470
Um,
I would say if I,
if I really had an inclination.
Okay.
I don't know.

2579
02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:55.870
What about Rory Robbie?
Um,

2580
02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:59.410
how bad does that fight get overlooked since salt cone or very bad.
It's crazy.

2581
02:26:59.590 --> 02:27:02.650
It's really,
it's really a shame because I love that it's just good to fight.

2582
02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:04.960
They're going to get a piece of the paper view so they're going to bear a fit

2583
02:27:04.961 --> 02:27:05.291
anyway.

2584
02:27:05.291 --> 02:27:09.250
But I think that Rory Macdonald and Robbie Lawler is a very fucking tough fight

2585
02:27:09.251 --> 02:27:10.720
to call.
We talked with Shannon,

2586
02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.630
I don't know what the fuck's going to happen and I don't know what the fuck's

2587
02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.550
gonna happen in the main event either.
I don't have an opinion on either.

2588
02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.760
That's why it's so exciting.
I don't know.

2589
02:27:17.890 --> 02:27:20.680
But I know that it's a biggest challenge.
Connor's ever faced hands.

2590
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:21.730
But that's what we were saying before.

2591
02:27:21.731 --> 02:27:24.850
He fought Poria and he knocked it out for you in the first round and then does

2592
02:27:24.851 --> 02:27:29.350
this man Mendez and I love Porsche,
but men does is a far cry from port.

2593
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:34.140
Are we doing in the fight?
Fight companions?
Yes.
Right.

2594
02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:37.820
You guys going to do a flight companion without me and my studio right next

2595
02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:41.050
Saturday.
[inaudible] exciting.
I'm excited.
I like it.

2596
02:27:41.051 --> 02:27:44.500
I like this one without the man.
Eddie Bravo going to do it.
If you talked to him,

2597
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:47.650
he's supposed to get back to me.
I said I,
I said,
hey man,

2598
02:27:47.651 --> 02:27:50.860
we're going to companion and he goes without Rogan.
That's crazy.
I mean,

2599
02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:55.600
if you're scared,
I get it.

2604
02:28:13.490 --> 02:28:17.230

Good googly Mowgli.
