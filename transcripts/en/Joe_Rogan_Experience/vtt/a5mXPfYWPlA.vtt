<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So tell me what the fuck happened with Tracy Morgan.</v>

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll preface this.</v>

4
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to be safe and prefaces that my buddy Jay Moore does tell this on stage.</v>

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.591
<v Speaker 1>We have an agreement.</v>

6
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.161
<v Speaker 1>He's my friend.</v>

7
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>He's not a thief.</v>

8
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:12.331
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

10
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.164
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

11
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I know that Jay is concerned about that,</v>

12
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but he told me he's not telling the story anymore.</v>

13
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And it did happen to me as long as,</v>

14
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a true story is a true story.</v>

15
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.313
<v Speaker 1>It's a true story.</v>

16
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>So as a young comic working in at the Boston Comedy Club,</v>

17
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>we're in the door in New York,</v>

18
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>

19
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>And I used to party with all the black comics because they well cause you like</v>

21
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:34.004
<v Speaker 1>to yeah.</v>

22
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And so we uh,</v>

23
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>we used to have a good time.</v>

24
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then one night Tracy Morgan comes in,</v>

25
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>this is when he starts to get back into standup after SNL.</v>

26
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So like when you were young comic in a new celebrity coming you like had to see</v>

27
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>that shit had to,</v>

28
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>so I go in and I watched Tracy set and it is not,</v>

29
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>we have nothing in common.</v>

30
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>He's doing observational material and his observational material is like,</v>

31
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>oh right you okay?</v>

32
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

33
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>who remembers Vinca fucking bout a handball courts and I'm just like,</v>

34
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks that's a shared experience like losing a sock in the dryer,</v>

35
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

36
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else.</v>

37
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And then he walks you through and he's like,</v>

38
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you would put that bitch up against the wall,</v>

39
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.541
<v Speaker 1>just pussy pop.</v>

40
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>That bitch wouldn't even kiss.</v>

41
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>So put your arm and your own stank and now you have a visualization of like</v>

42
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>precious getting boxed out at a handball court,</v>

43
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>making eye contact with passer by just getting her Bootsy blown out by Tracy</v>

44
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.553
<v Speaker 1>Morgan.</v>

45
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>He goes on stage and he's like,</v>

46
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

47
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I hit that man.</v>

49
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got this new bit about my dick being so pretty.</v>

50
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Or you can soak it with the lights on,</v>

51
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>which is a genius statement.</v>

52
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I never had a blowjob in the light,</v>

53
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but he just didn't word it right.</v>

54
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.703
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

56
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the lights are.</v>

57
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.401
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

58
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:49.641
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>so he goes,</v>

60
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.831
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

61
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so then he goes,</v>

63
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.451

<v Speaker 1>There's other tables that have champagne on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And so I'm getting Heinekens and then the whole night goes through,</v>

141
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an interesting,</v>

142
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>bizarre experience,</v>

143
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>but like two o'clock in the morning and uh,</v>

145
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>of me cause I'm going to table with all black dudes.</v>

146
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>So she thinks on their agent or lawyer or coach,</v>

147
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.364
<v Speaker 1>whatever I am.</v>

148
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So she gives me the bill and I see it and I'm like,</v>

149
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.741
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

150
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.191
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

151
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And Tracy Morgan flips out and he goes,</v>

152
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.651
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

153
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

154
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking racism.</v>

155
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>You give it to him.</v>

156
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>He works the God damn dog.</v>

157
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't new.</v>

158
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I not make any money on the rich mobile fucking here.</v>

159
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm on TV.</v>

160
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm the ritual,</v>

161
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:07.241
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

162
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And he flips the bottle of champagne table upside down.</v>

163
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.433
<v Speaker 1>Now the woman's like,</v>

164
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm sir.</v>

165
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

166
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.851
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

167
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And he takes his shirt and throws it in her face.</v>

168
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>A bouncer comes up and he's like,</v>

169
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>excuse me sir.</v>

170
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And Tracy just wham lays the guy in the biggest fight I've ever been in just</v>

171
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>breaks out all over.</v>

172
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>People are fighting,</v>

173
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>jumping on,</v>

174
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and I think I'm on PCP.</v>

175
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So I walk out on Houseton and I start going,</v>

176
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.344
<v Speaker 1>this isn't happening.</v>

177
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.131
<v Speaker 1>This is the imaginary.</v>

178
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>This is not real.</v>

179
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>People are flooding out left and right.</v>

180
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.731
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

181
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:33.971
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

182
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>that shit's going off trees.</v>

183
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>He's got like four dudes on him.</v>

184
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.551
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

185
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.384
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

186
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>A minute later the doors kicked open and Tracy Morgan is launched out of the</v>

187
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 1>club by the back of his neck and a seat of his pants just up onto the street</v>

188
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.901
<v Speaker 1>shirt on him.</v>

189
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>No up on the street,</v>

190
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>shirtless laying at my feet on the sidewalk.</v>

191
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Doors close.</v>

192
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Second later door's kicked back open and Tracy's shirt comes out,</v>

193
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>end over end and lands on his head and it's silent.</v>

194
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And we're looking at Tracy like,</v>

195
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:00.760

197
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he looks up,</v>

198
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.311
<v Speaker 1>stands up,</v>

199
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:03.851
<v Speaker 1>takes his shirt,</v>

200
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.231
<v Speaker 1>snaps it,</v>

201
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

202
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>now that's how you get out of paying a check.</v>

203
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.450
<v Speaker 2>This guy's crazy.</v>

204
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:12.410

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.803
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

210
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

211
00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>did he ever have to pay for it whenever?</v>

212
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:26.174
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

213
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

214
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.040

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.501
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

216
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:28.220

218
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't hang out with a dude more than that.</v>

219
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

224
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.763
<v Speaker 3>I never knew how to start.</v>

225
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.881
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear anything.</v>

226
