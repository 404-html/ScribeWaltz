00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:06.704
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

447
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.570
<v Speaker 1>like I cannot believe what you mean.</v>

448
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:09.021
<v Speaker 1>Tolerance.</v>

449
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

450
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

451
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like I can't believe I ran a mile and you just ran 40 miles.</v>

452
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that's crazy to me.</v>

453
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And we both finished at the same time and then I go.</v>

454
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:19.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'm amazed that he's not affected.</v>

455
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.091
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

456
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how much that fucking we have to go.</v>

457
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I almost had three panic attacks on that flight you got.</v>

458
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

459
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

460
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It made me so happy</v>

461
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.970
<v Speaker 1>that he was also fucked up.</v>

462
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:31.804
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

463
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Carrie still goes down right back in.</v>

464
00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:35.554
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

465
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.831
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

466
00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad it's starting to wear off.</v>

467
00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:37.241
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

468
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 1>not for me.</v>

469
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.671
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up,</v>

470
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

471
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 1>His idea of going deep is so much deeper than your idea.</v>

473
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>He's breaking world records on a daily basis all the time.</v>

474
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>He's at the bottom of the Marianas trench with a shovel and he's like,</v>

475
00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>there's be a deepest spot.</v>

476
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

477
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing he did as we get off that was like,</v>

478
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>let's smoke this joint.</v>

479
00:11:59.291 --> 00:11:59.531
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

480
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

481
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about man?</v>

482
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.900
<v Speaker 1>We're not smoking a joint.</v>

483
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I can take a break and he's a maniac breaks.</v>

484
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 1>He's of no Greg Maniac.</v>

485
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

486
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Well he just goes through the whole day like that.</v>

487
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.181
<v Speaker 1>And that's where,</v>

488
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:13.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 1>people would step in and say,</v>

490
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>well that boy's got a problem.</v>

491
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

492
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what he got.</v>

493
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:18.930
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't.</v>

494
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

495
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>he gets for a comedian.</v>

496
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It might be the best way to live life.</v>

498
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Scared on a regular basis.</v>

500
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And in between laughing your Dick off,</v>

501
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>

502
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>laughing your dick off.</v>

503
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Scared,</v>

504
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>laughing you dick off.</v>

505
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:31.391

<v Speaker 1>even his regular cadence,</v>

512
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's so is out of the norm for other people that you see people react to them.</v>

513
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It's more fun to even watch people like at the restaurant next to us react to</v>

514
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>him than it is almost to watch him.</v>

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Like he's talking and I see them like,</v>

516
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.351
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

517

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like you brought in a pit bull to have lunch here.</v>

520
00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:58.211
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

521
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 1>They've never seen somebody so intense and animate and saying these crazy</v>

522
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

523
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like you watch them react to Joey.</v>

524
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.701
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

551
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Where'd that come from?</v>

552
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>You want to kill somebody?</v>

553

558
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>And then my favorite thing is they'll say something and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

570
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:53.380

571
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It's never doing an act because his act as his life and his life as his act.</v>

578
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 1>of your ability to be you offstage and onstage.</v>

1078
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I kept trying to be cool about it and I was like,</v>

1079
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.241
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like that's what's up.</v>

1081
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:54.471
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1082
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying man.</v>

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.533
<v Speaker 4>Look at that sac.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Totally like trying to be like,</v>

1085
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:00.801
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

1086
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>

1087
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 4>They walk out,</v>

1088
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:07.301
<v Speaker 4>they leave me in his trailer with two guns and a fucking message to not to shoot</v>

1089
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:11.930
<v Speaker 4>everybody but his mother and I just sit there and I watch the MTV video music</v>

1090
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 4>awards and the whole time,</v>

1091
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:14.481
<v Speaker 4>like every show that comes,</v>

1092
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:19.481
<v Speaker 4>I just am rocking and I'm actually hoping that it's an intruder versus his mom</v>

1093
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like if it's his mom,</v>

1094
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 4>she might accidentally shoot her.</v>

1095
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.180
<v Speaker 4>How is she going to react to my explanation?</v>

1096
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Like pep had just told me to wait here.</v>

1097
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Well he's getting some weed for me,</v>

1098
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:30.551
<v Speaker 4>but I'm,</v>

1099
00:25:30.551 --> 00:25:31.670
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm supposed to shoot everybody,</v>

1100
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:32.504
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

1101
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.613
<v Speaker 4>are you cool with that?</v>

1102
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1103
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:35.851
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1104
00:25:35.851 --> 00:25:36.201
<v Speaker 4>that happens.</v>

1105
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 4>All thought like,</v>

1106
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.790
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to react to this?</v>

1107
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 4>So I fuck,</v>

1108
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:39.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1109
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:41.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a panic attack.</v>

1110
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.080
<v Speaker 4>We finally,</v>

1111
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.913
<v Speaker 4>they come back,</v>

1112
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 4>I get back in with a white Pete,</v>

1113
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.720
<v Speaker 4>he drives us back and I'm sitting there,</v>

1114
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1115
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck dude,</v>

1116
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:51.560
<v Speaker 4>that was the worst shit ever.</v>

1117
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm fucking terrified.</v>

1118
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:53.241
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1119
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:53.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1120
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.141
<v Speaker 4>him and Pat,</v>

1121
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Pat,</v>

1122
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:55.060
<v Speaker 4>Steven,</v>

1123
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 4>pat became like best friends.</v>

1124
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 4>So they became like super close.</v>

1125
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 4>Like that was like his guy he would go to and I'd be like,</v>

1126
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 4>no dude,</v>

1127
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hang out with pat pat at all.</v>

1128
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 4>And like six months later when Steve got his license,</v>

1129
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 4>we went and he was like,</v>

1130
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you want to get some weed today?</v>

1131
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:08.421
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1132
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1133
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.961
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1134
00:26:08.961 --> 00:26:09.201
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1135
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 4>So where we go,</v>

1136
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 4>we go to fort peers,</v>

1137
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.980
<v Speaker 4>pull it to pat Pat's and I'm like,</v>

1138
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 4>God dammit Mike.</v>

1139
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 4>She remembered how to get there.</v>

1140
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:15.921
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

1141
00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Steve had started going there all the time.</v>

1142
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1143
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 4>We pulled up to his trailer this time he gets out now this time I'm like,</v>

1144
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:21.981
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1145
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:22.591
<v Speaker 4>they're friends,</v>

1146
00:26:22.591 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 4>so this is probably gonna be a much quicker thing.</v>

1147
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.521
<v Speaker 4>He comes out,</v>

1148
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 4>he jumps in the back and he's like,</v>

1149
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:27.201
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1150
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:27.681
<v Speaker 4>let's roll.</v>

1151
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1152
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1153
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1154
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.110
<v Speaker 4>like fuck.</v>

1155
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 4>And look for a sack again.</v>

1156
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought you just have this.</v>

1157
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>So this time we went to this,</v>

1158
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:40.010
<v Speaker 4>but these are the things [inaudible] scared the shit out of me the first time.</v>

1159
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 4>But that second time he saved our life actually because we went from his trailer</v>

1160
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 4>the second time where he jumped in the back,</v>

1161
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 4>went to Avenue d,</v>

1162
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.820
<v Speaker 4>which is the fucking shitty street in Fort Pierce.</v>

1163
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're going to like every city,</v>

1164
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:54.054
<v Speaker 4>you know you have like,</v>

1165
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 4>I dunno whatever city you're in there like that's ever seen.</v>

1166
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Have you been to the street where you see open drug dealing where there's not</v>

1167
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.150
<v Speaker 4>even some type of facades?</v>

1168
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Angeles had been down a street where there's like,</v>

1169
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:06.180
<v Speaker 4>there's no pretense about it.</v>

1170
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:07.830
<v Speaker 4>There's just like Los Angeles,</v>

1171
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.770
<v Speaker 4>which part of filming?</v>

1172
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.411
<v Speaker 4>Fear factor.</v>

1173
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 4>We were actually filming the playboy playmate addition of fear factor downtown</v>

1174
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:14.784
<v Speaker 4>area and yeah,</v>

1175
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>we were watching people sell drugs,</v>

1176
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 4>smoke crack right there.</v>

1177
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.210
<v Speaker 4>We were in a crane and we're like,</v>
