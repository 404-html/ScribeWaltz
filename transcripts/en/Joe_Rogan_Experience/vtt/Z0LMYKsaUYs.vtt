<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Mr Henneghan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking in the background.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tweet tweet.</v>

9
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Tweet it while I'm talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope the mayor of Fizz B.</v>

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

12
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.240
<v Speaker 2>You're becoming the mayor of La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be your thing,</v>

13
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:31.241
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred square miles of studio </v>

14
00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A twitter.</v>

15
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I knew when I pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will you.</v>

16
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>What the Uber dropped us at the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

17
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:41.861
<v Speaker 2>but then we walked a few buildings down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw a pickup truck loading epsom </v>

18
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 2>salt into a side door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

19
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's flotation tank shit right there.</v>

20
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 2>We get the right door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going live with Douglas.</v>

22
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I only did a flotation tank once for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot at your house for the man show and</v>

23
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 2>you had the one in the house and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for a shoot so you can't really</v>

24
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:06.131
<v Speaker 2>sit back and enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for that 30 seconds they shut the </v>

25
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 2>door until they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

27
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking weird.</v>

28
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

29
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And it never stops being weird.</v>

30
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Like even though I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many times,</v>

31
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 2>every time I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking weird.</v>

32
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange feeling and you </v>

33
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>could shut it off anytime you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best part about it.</v>

34
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I love the fact that I could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of it.</v>

35
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do shrooms or something </v>

36
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a commitment.</v>

37
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in,</v>

38
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>you're in six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours.</v>

39
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where you're going or </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to call or stop by.</v>

40
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

41
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not shaking that you're just not </v>

42
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>going to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted it.</v>

43
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

44
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the tank you just get out.</v>

46
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just open the door.</v>

47
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:54.101
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's some kind of upkeep </v>

48
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary that I wouldn't do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd forget and I'd go on the road and I </v>

49
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 2>come back and there's bushes growing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

50
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should start a tank center in </v>

51
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Brisbane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If nobody has money in business,</v>

52
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to cost a lot of money.</v>

53
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>You get like one or two tanks and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just rent them out all day long.</v>

54
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

55
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like people have a disability is </v>

56
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the biggest form of income there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet insurance will pay for it.</v>

57
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should probably check.</v>

58
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they'll.</v>

59
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a form of therapy for sure.</v>

60
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>The point is I'm not good at upkeep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't have to have above </v>

61
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.261
<v Speaker 2>ground pool that is just nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>algae for eight months out of the year.</v>

62
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved into a house once in Encino and </v>

63
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody had lived in it for I guess like </v>

64
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 2>over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't do anything with the </v>

65
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.251
<v Speaker 2>pool and the pool would become this </v>
<v Speaker 2>green pond and there was schools of </v>

66
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>mosquito larva swimming around in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

67
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why in the fuck that?</v>

68
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you could see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the weirdest thing,</v>

69
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem with getting rid of the</v>

70
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

71
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>It was a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was looking.</v>

72
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:13.171
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got like a big stew of life out </v>

73
00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many mosquitoes.</v>

74
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Who was crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were like little schools of fish.</v>

75
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is madness.</v>

76
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>All these little things are blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking.</v>

77
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.561
<v Speaker 2>Little Vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fly around and find </v>

78
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:25.561
<v Speaker 2>things to bite at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I live,</v>

79
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no other body of water for 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles other than my above ground.</v>

80
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those little cons,</v>

81
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't kill them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just find a way to just breed and </v>

82
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>like back east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're way worse now.</v>

83
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 2>They're way worse than they are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something about the weather out </v>

84
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that keeps them in check.</v>

85
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 2>The worst by far is Alaska that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

86
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally shit man,</v>

87
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>you get out of the car and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>swarm you like huge,</v>

88
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>huge and super aggressive and they only </v>
<v Speaker 2>live to be like three months old,</v>

89
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 2>so when they're going for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just fucking going for it.</v>

90
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like some Wolf Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like survival of the fittest with,</v>

91
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's the weirdest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

92
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 2>they're a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have an idea on mosquitoes.</v>

93
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're annoying to get cheese slab.</v>

94
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

95
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

96
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

97
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

98
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>This is a swarm is there's hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in your face and your eyes all over</v>

99
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 2>your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere.</v>

100
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.971
<v Speaker 2>We have no CMC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pool was cool when we get that </v>

102
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's above ground,</v>

103
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's on a slope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a deck on one side,</v>

104
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 2>so it seems like an above ground pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're above the pool,</v>

105
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's still an above ground pool and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only four feet deep or something,</v>

106
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 2>but once monsoons hit look at that.</v>

107
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mosquitoes in Alaska.</v>

108
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at what looks like a swarm</v>
<v Speaker 2>of birds.</v>

109
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst part about naked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

110
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>If you ever watched that show is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>

111
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I could go a month without eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that anyway.</v>

112
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm a drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my calories from the mixer.</v>

113
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to stay naked?</v>

114
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Like can you make clothes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much they cheat.</v>

115
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have made clothes.</v>

116
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.680
<v Speaker 2>They were clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much they have.</v>

117
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 2>The producer says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

118
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>you can make the beaver cloth but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't make a full like Hoodie.</v>

119
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 2>They do it with every one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

120
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 2>They'll call those shows reality shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain amount of like </v>

121
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>plotted out ideas and you could see them</v>
<v Speaker 2>take place.</v>

122
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>You could see like the act you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting in people.</v>

123
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole chunk in the book that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to promote,</v>

124
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but about it's how I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glued to reality just to find where </v>

125
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 2>they're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

126
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>That's honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the name.</v>

127
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who came up with it.</v>

128
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

129
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an author like a legit author.</v>

130
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

131
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 2>but you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've written too,</v>

132
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 2>like legitimate books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty fucking interesting,</v>

133
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:58.891
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different kind of person to do </v>

134
00:05:58.891 --> 00:05:58.891
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's um,</v>

135
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt like an extra one on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I love is.</v>

136
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 3>You actually wrote this to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wrote,</v>

137
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 3>wrote this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no guy.</v>

138
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

139
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with those guys </v>

140
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.460
<v Speaker 3>because that's probably the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a job,</v>

141
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.460
<v Speaker 3>his book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

142
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.060
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 3>If a guy's not going to write it right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Get a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a guy.</v>

145
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz could sit and tell you all </v>

146
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 3>their salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 3>He could tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

148
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

149
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I could never trust anyone to write so </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

150
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 3>so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to so many authors or </v>

151
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.911
<v Speaker 3>writers or journalists even that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand in a piece and then the editor </v>

152
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:34.600
<v Speaker 3>tweaks and changes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

153
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an editor got fired from the Daily News </v>

154
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.541
<v Speaker 3>for doing that pretty recently because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy had attribution's and his story,</v>

155
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 3>the different studies and shit where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

156
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 3>where he got the information that was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whatever the version.</v>

157
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.670
<v Speaker 3>And then he got accused of plagiarism </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he has the original document that </v>

158
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 3>he sent to the publisher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the editor was the plagiarist.</v>

159
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 3>The editor just decides we don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell people about that.</v>

160
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 3>They made a weird judgment call and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>removed the references,</v>

161
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 3>know interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often they fuck up what you said.</v>

162
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember I was the winner of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montreal Comedy Festival.</v>

163
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no winner in 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one wins.</v>

164
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand what that means.</v>

165
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 3>But it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

166
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read,</v>

167
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 3>which I don't on purpose now you read an</v>
<v Speaker 3>interview.</v>

168
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>

169
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Now you're making me look like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And other comics are going to see this </v>

170
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't say it like that.</v>

171
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 3>You're like the only guy that ever won a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy competition that people don't </v>

172
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 3>hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 3>because you want San Francisco.</v>

174
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody that was after that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

175
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Like there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a big deal and it wasn't a </v>

176
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were both completely unknown at </v>

177
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 3>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But still,</v>

178
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you weren't unknown in the comedy world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll put up the mission itself in</v>

179
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 3>the late seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighties was a huge deal.</v>

180
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.210
<v Speaker 3>That's when Robin Williams and Ellen </v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerate.</v>

181
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>By the time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was me and an unknown.</v>

182
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:09.401
<v Speaker 3>Dane Cook Bryant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think competitions are fucking weird </v>

183
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a change in what it is.</v>

184
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I like the festival idea festivals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

185
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to make it fucking star </v>
<v Speaker 3>search or whatever.</v>

186
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know America's got talent.</v>

187
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:20.250
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

188
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the country wants to </v>

189
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 3>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's what it did.</v>

190
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Introduce a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they started doing the standup</v>

191
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 3>show the fuck it is.</v>

192
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 3>This comic standing last comic standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the introduction of a lot of people </v>

193
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 3>got to a lot of good comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

194
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how people found out about</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

195
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as long as you know going in that </v>

196
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:44.940

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

197
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 3>When you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did a seattle.</v>

198
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:51.911
<v Speaker 3>I played up there while the Seattle </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition was going on and a girl I </v>

199
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 3>know was in it and I had to know you </v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

200
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:59.771
<v Speaker 3>play to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judges are going to be people like </v>

201
00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 3>fucking morning show,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just do your best if it makes you work.</v>

204
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.130

<v Speaker 3>because it made me work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>minded and intelligent than the rest of </v>

218
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.340
<v Speaker 3>the country where the people that hired </v>
<v Speaker 3>the judges,</v>

219
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 3>that producer,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they appreciated you.</v>

222
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Before that I was the judge a year or </v>
<v Speaker 3>two later when I want to keep being self</v>

223

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.970
<v Speaker 3>around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked them up.</v>

234
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every here and again.</v>

235
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:44.661
<v Speaker 3>You remember Dat Phan and you search to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see and those occasionally he'd be </v>

236
00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:48.441
<v Speaker 3>playing a casino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy that I felt like there's </v>

237
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:51.430
<v Speaker 3>some really unbalanced hatred towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very odd when he won last comic </v>

238
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 3>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were really mad.</v>

239
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 3>There was a certain percentage of comics</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were really mad and let me tell you</v>

240
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:03.021
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there when he had a set and he </v>

241
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:05.811
<v Speaker 3>fucking killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucking killed whether or not you </v>

242
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of material or not.</v>

243
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 3>There was like he got up a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred.</v>

244
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Was wasn't just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a young guy like,</v>

245
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>

246
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:18.051
<v Speaker 3>Craig?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Eliza one last comic standing </v>

247
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:18.051
<v Speaker 3>when she was like three years in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

248
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I think she said that she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said that three or four years in.</v>

249
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I hope I don't say the wrong years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's kind of the same thing</v>

250
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>along the same lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

251
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Like you're getting in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do it,</v>

252
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

253
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've got eight minutes to kill,</v>

254
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 3>you can break it up and for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

255
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:39.951
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are so pissed at him because he </v>

256
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:39.951
<v Speaker 3>was kind of fresh to comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

257
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:43.461
<v Speaker 3>Like he hadn't been ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those scientists that you </v>

258
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.541
<v Speaker 3>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sat down and he grabbed the laughs </v>

259
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:50.241
<v Speaker 3>per minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting based on his recordings of </v>

260
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 3>his sets and really did that on last </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic standing.</v>

261
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 3>He'd have these graphs of laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

262
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Why do I hate that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

263
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:03.511
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this on a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday where like the all the people </v>

264
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:08.611
<v Speaker 3>that you were trained to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about like carrot top and </v>

265
00:12:08.611 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 3>the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hated carrot top as a comedian.</v>

266
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:15.061
<v Speaker 3>You kinda had to hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he beat Bill Hicks for some </v>

267
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 3>comedy award back when they had comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>awards.</v>

268
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's also the prop thing,</v>

269
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a prop comic is a lesser man,</v>

270
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's essentially,</v>

271
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 3>he's the last guy that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interfere with us.</v>

272
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 3>He no one's flipping a coin between </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrot top and Joe Rogan.</v>

273
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

274
00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:36.971
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's enough to go around </v>

275
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 3>even if they were like this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying all that hatred.</v>

276
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:42.691
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about Dennis Leary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I listened to on stern and I really </v>

277
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:47.701
<v Speaker 3>loved the interview and I liked Denis </v>
<v Speaker 3>leary and I realized it was just all </v>

278
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:52.471
<v Speaker 3>that he stole Bill Hicks Persona thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I just hated him for that.</v>

279
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 3>And you get old and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really give a shit.</v>

280
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when do you let it go?</v>

281
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wendy let it go when we're old and go,</v>

282
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were joking around before the show </v>

283
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.461
<v Speaker 3>about how to send off an email and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably talking to someone on twitter </v>

284
00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck your mother,</v>

285
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 3>like you imagine in that guy is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that all the time.</v>

286
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Like God damn thatall right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Owen Benjamin and he's like,</v>

287
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I don't sleep.</v>

288
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to me man.</v>

289
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 3>You've got to stop doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Owen will fucking go to war on twitter </v>

290
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jamie Kilstein,</v>

291
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:32.401
<v Speaker 3>Jamie Kilstein was on and he was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>open about how he would be when he was </v>

292
00:13:32.401 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 3>all social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warrior it out.</v>

293
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.690
<v Speaker 3>He would get crazy with his phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these arguments where he couldn't think </v>

294
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.401
<v Speaker 3>of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was constantly pulling his phone </v>

295
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:41.401
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checking and what did they say?</v>

296
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:41.401
<v Speaker 3>What they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

297
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:45.991
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking cisgender piece of shit or </v>

298
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you get mad with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get obsessed.</v>

299
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 3>I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do it folks.</v>

300
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Avoid arguments in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're arguing down.</v>

301
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.060
<v Speaker 3>You might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

302
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.380
<v Speaker 3>you might be like going to war with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's on your own level.</v>

303
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd argue on A.</v>

304
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of recent things were </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends of mine are arguing.</v>

305
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>You know that you look like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>open mic or when you,</v>

306
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.200
<v Speaker 3>when you have these arguments in </v>
<v Speaker 3>business with people who are far your </v>

307
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.860
<v Speaker 3>underlings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just.</v>

308
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just really feel like we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>try for meaningful discussion with </v>

309
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>friendly people and just figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck we disagree on,</v>

310
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's where I get trapped is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy that when the Jehovah's witness </v>

311
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.211
<v Speaker 3>comes to my door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to find them the mood I'm </v>

312
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:39.211
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to prove them wrong.</v>

313
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 3>And the less sense they make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harder that fucking wood is to knock</v>

314
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 3>on how you store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be my thing.</v>

315
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I would always want to argue with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

316
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Especially about like if someone</v>

317
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 2>had had some ridiculous religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>

318
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I would always argue with them about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I don't.</v>

319
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as long as I'm nice,</v>

320
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it helps a lot of people I </v>

321
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:07.360
<v Speaker 2>really do and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if they're not right,</v>

322
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live like it's true,</v>

323
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 2>it is right while you're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live like it's true.</v>

324
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:19.991
<v Speaker 2>Like we look at it like almost from two </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions when there's like multiple </v>

325
00:15:19.991 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 2>dimensions to the idea of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even though it probably,</v>

326
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 2>there was never a time where a guy came </v>
<v Speaker 2>back from the dead.</v>

327
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 2>There's probably never a time where a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy walked on water.</v>

328
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you buy the idea of this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this person's goal for humanity and </v>

329
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:38.441
<v Speaker 2>move toward the directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like moving towards love and compassion </v>

330
00:15:38.441 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 2>and treating each other as equals.</v>

331
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like the whole Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

332
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 2>So even if it's it never really weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstition,</v>

333
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 2>that was the catalyst to make you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent person.</v>

334
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like all human things,</v>

335
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.070
<v Speaker 2>he gets poisoned along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea behind it,</v>

336
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 2>if even if you don't think it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you treat it like it's true,</v>

337
00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.540
<v Speaker 2>it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you really will make a better </v>

338
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.540
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like super hippie.</v>

339
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's twisty shit.</v>

340
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And if you have some mental illness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you believe you're driving a </v>

341
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 2>cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driving a fucking Cadillac,</v>

342
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.820
<v Speaker 2>but you know how we have laws and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have certain ways that we behave and we </v>

343
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 2>have agreements with how we dress and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the words we use,</v>

344
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 2>the phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a religion that was all </v>

345
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.411
<v Speaker 2>super positive that we just all agreed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt just the same way we adopt all </v>

346
00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:27.650

<v Speaker 2>sex cult who was in the backyard,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You have to watch Nathan for you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>good?</v>

463

<v Speaker 3>You just need to just find out what able</v>

465
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.330

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I really want to go in?</v>

467
00:22:19.401 --> 00:22:21.960
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be a handicapable.</v>

468
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're your person that doesn't get the </v>

469
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you are mocking someone who's </v>

470
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Speaker 3>like literally stupid or low watt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gurgler in a high back chair.</v>

471
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

475
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 4>That was my last special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a whole bit about,</v>

476
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 4>it's called the euphemism treadmill </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can't say retarded because.</v>

477
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.150
<v Speaker 4>But retarded was the clinical term </v>
<v Speaker 4>because before that they were called </v>

478
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 4>imbeciles and morons or they were called</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mongoloid idiots.</v>

479
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:01.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it was for kids with </v>

480
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:03.481
<v Speaker 4>downs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kept changing it and then we kept </v>

481
00:23:03.481 --> 00:23:06.421
<v Speaker 4>making fun of them with the new name so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to change the new name to </v>

482
00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:09.160
<v Speaker 4>something else and then we'd make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the new name under the punchline to</v>

483
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 4>the entire long bit was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

484
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 4>if you went straight clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition,</v>

485
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 4>American Medical Association and you </v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you made that stick.</v>

487

<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm going to make fun of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

488
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:24.730

<v Speaker 4>axial instability usually associated </v>

490
00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:34.501
<v Speaker 4>with the trisomy 21 genetic disorder.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's certain things can make fun of </v>

493
00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:48.580
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>White people are failure.</v>

494
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.870

<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're a white guy.</v>

496
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 3>You hate white people making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>

497
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 3>They last long with you because they own</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

498
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawyers are good.</v>

499
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 3>One to make fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't make fun of Jews.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>

507
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.380

<v Speaker 3>That's a only Jews.</v>

510
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.390

<v Speaker 3>you'd be okay.</v>

511
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.220

<v Speaker 3>People accept that,</v>

512
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 3>but it feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

533
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about when it's just a mixed</v>

<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

536
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 3>you know this well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still do some shit.</v>

537
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:45.851
<v Speaker 3>I saw you last time I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were doing one of those weird shows </v>

538
00:25:45.851 --> 00:25:49.241
<v Speaker 3>where people just called out premises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up on the spot and you fucking </v>

539
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 3>destroyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you told me afterwards,</v>

540
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 3>none of that was planned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had none of that in your holster.</v>

541
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 3>All of that was off the top of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

542
00:25:55.581 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 3>which is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was high as a kite.</v>

543
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I barely knew what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for me to do material.</v>

544
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I can't do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen minutes.</v>

545
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.150
<v Speaker 3>One minute.</v>

546
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Give me a mental hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come into the embrace of the comedy </v>

547
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.220
<v Speaker 3>store to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is,</v>

548
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 3>why would I do it outside of my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfort zone?</v>

549
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 3>Don't you aren't in your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your comfort zone is everywhere.</v>

550
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 3>If I went up on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I came to town,</v>

551
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:28.451
<v Speaker 3>which I rarely do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to see you and a million people I </v>

552
00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 3>never see all in one room and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves to see you too,</v>

553
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.760
<v Speaker 3>but if I went on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would have this whole anxiety,</v>

554
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucked,</v>

555
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>and then I'd be apologizing for my set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

556
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Set says Greg proops or someone and then</v>

557
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't good.</v>

558
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:49.941
<v Speaker 3>I forgot this tag and that tag and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than just hanging out and </v>

559
00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 3>enjoying myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fuck it.</v>

560
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing though,</v>

561
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.650
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say this with all </v>

562
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.571
<v Speaker 3>sincerity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more understanding and </v>

563
00:26:59.571 --> 00:27:03.470
<v Speaker 3>camaraderie at the store right now than </v>
<v Speaker 3>any place I've ever been at any time.</v>

564
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.560
<v Speaker 3>And even when we have bad sets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people have someone have a bad set </v>

565
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:09.560
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how was it dude?</v>

566
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I could not connect with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone will say,</v>

567
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be fill Arkansas.</v>

568
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Then the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front of my peers somewhere.</v>

569
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:23.510
<v Speaker 3>No one will see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about it and you learn </v>

570
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>something from it and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a weird environment,</v>

571
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:30.231
<v Speaker 3>but it fosters new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fosters new ideas and taglines and </v>

572
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>which I was going to say about twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles.</v>

573
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I got so much good material out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting these,</v>

574
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my space,</v>

575
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:46.671
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook before that news groups and </v>

576
00:27:46.671 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 3>getting into these angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly arguments.</v>

577
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 3>When I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing paragraphs in defense of and</v>

578
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I have 15 minutes because some stooge</v>

579
00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.440
<v Speaker 3>annoyed me on a dot comedy standup news </v>
<v Speaker 3>group and I spent all night fighting,</v>

580
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 3>accidentally wrote a new act.</v>

581
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.700
<v Speaker 3>That's actually probably a good use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it if you could see you and I are very </v>

582
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.751
<v Speaker 3>different in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather just not talk to those </v>

583
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:14.751
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you did want to go to war,</v>

584
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.910
<v Speaker 3>which I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get some material out of that </v>

585
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:19.910
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're forcing yourself to think</v>

586
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Speaker 3>again anytime you forced yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

587
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I've found that like the best shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I ever write.</v>

588
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I write completely free form where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

589
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

590
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just start thinking about,</v>

591
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any subject and just start writing.</v>

592
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not specifically try to write jokes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and on,</v>

593
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 3>on the way I can like Kinda suck those </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes out of there.</v>

594
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you.</v>

595
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.640
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

596
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 3>the premise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the best premises I have,</v>

597
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 3>I write like a defense attorney.</v>

598
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.290
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we can look at it,</v>

599
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.300
<v Speaker 3>login the jokes afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the justice has left the courtroom,</v>

600
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 3>all rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you put it in the fist fuck jokes.</v>

601
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

602
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super important to have a balance.</v>

603
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:09.201
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you got to find out where that </v>

604
00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:10.431
<v Speaker 3>balance is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you can get away with a </v>

605
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:10.431
<v Speaker 3>premise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

606
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:13.190
<v Speaker 3>you've got to stack it just right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just stack it the wrong way one </v>

607
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look like you're patronizing and</v>

608
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:17.640
<v Speaker 3>you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stack at the wrong way the other way you</v>

609
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:22.641
<v Speaker 3>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a sexist or a Republican and secret </v>

610
00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I have notes?</v>

611
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 3>The new current current climate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

612
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

613
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Imagine working for a television show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to bring this up.</v>

614
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad we just got to talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

615
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Sam Cedar got fired yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed this.</v>

616
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.150
<v Speaker 3>So can I just saw someone on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal?</v>

617
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Sam Cedar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a heavy leftwing fellow who um,</v>

618
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 2>was apparently in some sort of a dispute</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the alt right.</v>

619
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about Roy Moore.</v>

620
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Like there's one of those things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they pulled up a tweet of his and took </v>

621
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.771
<v Speaker 2>it out of context from 2009 and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suite was.</v>

622
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to paraphrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck it up.</v>

623
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually Jamie,</v>

624
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 2>pull it up so we can find the exact</v>

625
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.400
<v Speaker 3>tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that if you paraphrase it,</v>

626
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:13.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going to sound funnier than he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

627
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.800
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that funny road interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was going to edit your act,</v>

628
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.830
<v Speaker 3>this is how you fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just actually,</v>

629
00:30:25.321 --> 00:30:28.350
<v Speaker 3>here's one minute ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's essentially what it is.</v>

630
00:30:28.351 --> 00:30:33.351
<v Speaker 3>If you can't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to find it and you've got to </v>

631
00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:33.351
<v Speaker 3>find the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't want to fuck this up.</v>

632
00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you how many times I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>told Hennigan about now this comment,</v>

633
00:30:36.571 --> 00:30:41.571
<v Speaker 3>you get to see this is a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do this bit and I do the bit for </v>

634
00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:41.571
<v Speaker 3>them and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

635
00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he sees them.</v>

636
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

637
00:30:43.831 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 3>you do it so much better than the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

638
00:30:45.871 --> 00:30:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Got Too many words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many words.</v>

639
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.810
<v Speaker 3>He's Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guilted into retarded.</v>

640
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Distracting you with admitted premise.</v>

641
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

642
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:03.020
<v Speaker 2>ms NBC got a swarm of emails like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people like attacked,</v>

643
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:10.070
<v Speaker 2>know these alt right fellows attacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and started saying that this guy had </v>

644
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:16.020
<v Speaker 2>tweeted a which essentially a rape joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we would never sponsored you </v>

645
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.960
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to contact your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsors.</v>

646
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.040
<v Speaker 2>This is what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a thing covering over the,</v>

647
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 2>a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't care.</v>

648
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat.</v>

649
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

650
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 2>don't care our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he polanski.</v>

651
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.580
<v Speaker 2>But I hope if my daughter is ever raped </v>
<v Speaker 2>by an older truly talented man with a </v>

652
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:32.580
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I.</v>

653
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:37.650
<v Speaker 2>But I hope if my daughter is ever raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is by an older truly talented man </v>

654
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.680
<v Speaker 2>with a great sense of Nissan Nissan </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes.</v>

655
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is,</v>

656
00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:45.970
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

657
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Here's the part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the part of the problem.</v>

658
00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 2>He deleted this which he regrets doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

659
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's a part of a series of tweets.</v>

660
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:57.570
<v Speaker 2>All of them that criticize people </v>
<v Speaker 2>support of Roman Polanski because Roman </v>

661
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Polanski had raped kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did really good films and he was </v>

662
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking disgusting.</v>

663
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was essentially saying,</v>

664
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 2>this is a horrific way to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy raped a baby,</v>

665
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He raped like a 13 year old.</v>

666
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

667
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.890
<v Speaker 2>So this was a part of a series of tweets</v>
<v Speaker 2>all expressing this and that was clearly</v>

668
00:32:17.891 --> 00:32:22.270
<v Speaker 2>satire and MSNBC capitulated and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired him.</v>

669
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

670
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him.</v>

671
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I know people who do know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some that like,</v>

672
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:29.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

673
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

674
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>it is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog in this fight,</v>

675
00:32:33.881 --> 00:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

676
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.980
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke was and that the fact that he </v>

677
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.560
<v Speaker 2>deleted it and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

678
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Is he apologizing for it?</v>

679
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

680
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did was he made a video </v>

681
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 2>explaining what the joke was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he said it,</v>

682
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that it was a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>series of tweets that he said,</v>

683
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once that fucking outrage machine,</v>

684
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I was just asked if I regret my tweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 2009,</v>

685
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I regret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laziness led me to delete it.</v>

686
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I would never regret criticizing rape </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologists.</v>

687
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with that tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Sam Cedar.</v>

688
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that he could probably start </v>

689
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.870
<v Speaker 2>a podcast and make a decent living and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not have to work for someone who's going</v>

690
00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 2>to fire him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

691
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:25.661
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he has his own show minority </v>

692
00:33:25.661 --> 00:33:25.661
<v Speaker 2>report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

693
00:33:25.661 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that his own show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does that.</v>

694
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:28.160
<v Speaker 2>His own Internet show because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he loved it.</v>

695
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

696
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:32.150
<v Speaker 2>and here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he isn't.</v>

697
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.520
<v Speaker 2>He had a dispute more than once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

698
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.850
<v Speaker 2>with my good friend Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he accused Sam Harris of being the </v>

699
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds familiar,</v>

700
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists.</v>

701
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't like that term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

702
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 2>He's an author's runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a podcast.</v>

703
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially an intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

704
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>

705
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the smartest guys I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>have my podcast.</v>

706
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:58.001
<v Speaker 2>So what was their beef?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris believes that all ideologies </v>

707
00:33:58.001 --> 00:34:00.290
<v Speaker 2>are inherently dangerous and Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very problematic.</v>

708
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.530
<v Speaker 2>And many people on the left think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you criticize Islam that you are </v>

709
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're akin to a racist.</v>

710
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you criticize Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

711
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:15.011
<v Speaker 2>someone was just not a rube right </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that weird thing because of </v>

712
00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:19.240
<v Speaker 2>brown skin and people's desire to not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived as racist so they go way </v>

713
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.441
<v Speaker 2>overboard with it and which is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening with the me too thing where </v>

714
00:34:23.441 --> 00:34:27.851
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see all the benefits of people coming </v>

715
00:34:27.851 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 2>out and it's putting the fear in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

716
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who let me die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck 20 years ago.</v>

717
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

718
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 2>but I just wanted to just for Sam Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's not a racist by any stretch of</v>

719
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 2>the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like ideologies.</v>

720
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like something that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that God wants you to kill people.</v>

721
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

722
00:34:45.531 --> 00:34:48.110
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you interpret that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way the Christians do.</v>

723
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing people over some shit from the </v>

724
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

725
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.611
<v Speaker 2>there's no one out there in the acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rate the rates of God for people </v>

726
00:34:57.611 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 2>wearing two different types of cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

727
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Because Christians are generally better </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and yeah,</v>

728
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.730
<v Speaker 2>once you get a lot of fucking toys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

729
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.740
<v Speaker 2>You Dismiss a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should kill myself in the name of </v>

730
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 2>blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking good point.</v>

731
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:15.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've always wondered if you look at </v>

732
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 2>like the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not looking at like rushed,</v>

733
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 2>lush tropical forests and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>beaches like Brazil.</v>

734
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 2>You know where everybody's happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to play fucking volleyball on </v>

735
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Jujitsu.</v>

736
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's having a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

737
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not the Saudi princes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will still wear the garb,</v>

738
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 2>but then once they get behind the gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>plated palace doors.</v>

739
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's dixit swinging and fucking </v>

740
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 2>champagne flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outside it's all sand for people</v>

741
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:43.130
<v Speaker 3>that have nothing better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Jesus works in the Mideast </v>

742
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Midwest where you're in fucking Indiana </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have fields to plow and it's </v>

743
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 3>gonna be Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

744
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Angry whether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe Jesus is the only thing </v>

745
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.581
<v Speaker 3>getting you through another year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another harvest and you put a marble on </v>

746
00:35:58.581 --> 00:36:02.211
<v Speaker 3>the highway and it just sits there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't keep rolling.</v>

747
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.850
<v Speaker 3>There's no hills bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snow hits the fucking worst.</v>

748
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Indiana is the worst state in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

749
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.980
<v Speaker 3>but even in Indiana they found gold and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it became like Qatar.</v>

750
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

751
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found oil,</v>

752
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.960
<v Speaker 3>they felt like some crazy new patch oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden they started </v>

753
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.201
<v Speaker 3>building the world's tallest building </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the same kind of shit they do </v>

754
00:36:24.201 --> 00:36:26.130
<v Speaker 3>in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do buy apparently is insane now.</v>

755
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 3>They have indoor surfing things in Dubai</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle.</v>

756
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Did you get a surfboard and your indoor </v>
<v Speaker 3>surfing?</v>

757
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.250
<v Speaker 3>You could ski in doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've indoor skiing in Dubai and </v>

758
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.560
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have that here in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>compound.</v>

759
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a name for this new uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towns and it's kind of worn.</v>

760
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus I think Anthony Kumi,</v>

761
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Kumina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I have to give him his props to.</v>

762
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the reason why I started a</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

763
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

764
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:58.701
<v Speaker 3>because he was a part of opiod anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the first time I ever thought </v>

765
00:36:58.701 --> 00:37:01.791
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really liked doing radio or the way </v>

766
00:37:01.791 --> 00:37:01.791
<v Speaker 3>opie and Anthony did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

767
00:37:01.791 --> 00:37:01.791
<v Speaker 3>We would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

768
00:37:01.791 --> 00:37:02.640
<v Speaker 3>you have done it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

769
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember first doing it going,</v>

770
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I the shitty episode?</v>

771
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Because no one really talked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just had fun.</v>

772
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I know I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me a minute to,</v>

773
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just decided to do what they wanted</v>

774
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:15.420
<v Speaker 3>to do with radio.</v>

775
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I just thought I was boring because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no bells and whistles and fake </v>

776
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.321
<v Speaker 3>laughs and to this day I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>opie and Anthony got the credit that it </v>

777
00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 3>deserved because I think that they let </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

778
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 3>they let us like they're the best show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the best show ever.</v>

779
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

780
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 3>but they were the best show ever to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>on today exist in their own world?</v>

781
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Anthony does and he still has.</v>

782
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 3>This was recently fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

783
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I just know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started his own thing.</v>

784
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Norton's still doing his thing with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Norton this still doing this thing with </v>

785
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

786
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:52.950
<v Speaker 3>He does UFC uncensored with Matt Serra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

787
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>And Norton also does the chip chip </v>
<v Speaker 3>person podcasts.</v>

788
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He does all that on his own now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

789
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I've never listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been tweeted about it enough to</v>

790
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 3>know that it's a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

791
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's so uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

792
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.220
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite things that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

793
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:13.221
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to see a video of it right now </v>

794
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.030
<v Speaker 3>we're in a live broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

795
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'll pull it up sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated making people listen to 30 </v>

796
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 3>seconds of Chacho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>

797
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

798
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Let people know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't know.</v>

799
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

800
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.700
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to tell you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

812
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.910

<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

813
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:57.570
<v Speaker 3>So the guy in order to get rid of copper</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

814
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to drink it out of a copper </v>

815
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.171
<v Speaker 3>cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just a big room and now </v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

820
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:14.431
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have a lime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every now and then someone sticks </v>

821
00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:14.431
<v Speaker 3>alignment at Dos equis and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's just not a strong beer.</v>

827
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm in a place that's dark,</v>

<v Speaker 3>which by the way it might get hot here </v>

840
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:13.560
<v Speaker 3>any minute now.</v>

841

<v Speaker 3>There is a fucking fire in Ventura and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the winds are insane right now in the </v>

921
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.881
<v Speaker 2>messaging would become popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's a bit that you could never </v>

922
00:44:20.881 --> 00:44:21.610
<v Speaker 2>do today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could only do that bit in 2005.</v>

923
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:26.080
<v Speaker 2>When it was like people were starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>send you text messages like without fuck</v>

<v Speaker 3>A postnet depression.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feeling that which is so like I,</v>

1122
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.840

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wasn't until.</v>

1126
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I misled myself.</v>

1127
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Which that's where you get scared with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the me too thing.</v>

1128
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I know I didn't rape anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many times might I have led a </v>

1129
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:58.071
<v Speaker 3>woman astray with promises of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everlasting love and harmony just </v>

1130
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 3>because I was drunk and wanted to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and then didn't call.</v>

1131
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:06.230
<v Speaker 3>I was inappropriate afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do the,</v>

1132
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1133
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're right for each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's stewing about it somewhere and</v>

1134
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:18.021
<v Speaker 3>wants are you can't meet to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely can happen like that.</v>

1135
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:23.421
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you got to leave room for all </v>

1136
00:54:23.421 --> 00:54:25.521
<v Speaker 3>possibilities because I think that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust everyone that comes forward with a</v>

1137
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:29.380
<v Speaker 3>story like you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1138
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>You should be open minded about all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>points of view.</v>

1139
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd hate to see someone get in trouble </v>

1140
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.901
<v Speaker 3>for something they didn't do because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they dated a gal and she hated them and </v>

1141
00:54:41.901 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 3>so she made up some stuff and this has </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened before.</v>

1142
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1143
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:46.470
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be.</v>

1144
00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please do.</v>

1145
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:53.510
<v Speaker 3>How many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we should clarify because this is </v>

1146
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.510
<v Speaker 3>a touchy subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1147
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:57.250
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not a sexist by any </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination in support of the alleged </v>

1148
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:03.360
<v Speaker 3>witch hunt because it is making people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are serious abusers and there's one </v>

1149
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I fucking want to out but I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1150
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1151
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:12.711
<v Speaker 3>that it's real and then you know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in positions of power like that </v>

1152
00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 3>to have people working under them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent upon them in that way.</v>

1153
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.680
<v Speaker 3>They will prey on them and do weird shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them and they've been doing it </v>

1154
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>forever because they can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that seems to be like,</v>

1155
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:26.510
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be how this town in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways was designed how the whole porn </v>

1156
00:55:26.521 --> 00:55:27.990
<v Speaker 3>industry was set up.</v>

1157
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 3>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a willingness on both sides.</v>

1158
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1159
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot of girls that</v>
<v Speaker 3>will fuck you for a part.</v>

1160
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1161
00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:41.360
<v Speaker 3>that's not the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

1162
00:55:41.361 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1163
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:47.211
<v Speaker 3>there's a million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The me to encapture encapsulates a lot </v>

1164
00:55:47.701 --> 00:55:52.701
<v Speaker 3>of different stages of sexual abuse </v>
<v Speaker 3>variances from.</v>

1165
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 3>I always like to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a sister mother rule,</v>

1166
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:03.370
<v Speaker 3>especially as I've gotten older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a thought about this for so long </v>

1167
00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like you have to treat every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in any,</v>

1168
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you have to look at every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what would that be like?</v>

1169
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.870
<v Speaker 3>If I found out that happened to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>

1170
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 3>what would that be like if I found out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happened to my sister.</v>

1171
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you go to children then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets really crazy and you get super </v>

1172
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:23.640
<v Speaker 3>psychotic and because your protective as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1173
00:56:23.641 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Although I'm</v>

1174
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.090
<v Speaker 2>very protective of my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that.</v>

1175
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.100
<v Speaker 2>You got to almost look at it like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think we get taught that </v>

1176
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:32.100
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1177
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes us a long time of </v>
<v Speaker 2>living as an adult to sort of figure out</v>

1178
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 2>like who's the Dick here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it me or is it them?</v>

1179
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:42.301
<v Speaker 2>Or is it my making bad choices?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I arguing with people and getting </v>

1180
00:56:42.301 --> 00:56:45.661
<v Speaker 2>these weird relationships with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I really don't belong with in the </v>

1181
00:56:45.661 --> 00:56:48.631
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I need to figure out who the fuck </v>

1182
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:51.391
<v Speaker 2>I am before I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's all these different things </v>

1183
00:56:51.391 --> 00:56:53.641
<v Speaker 2>that happen in a relationship and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times along the way people get into </v>

1184
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 2>some know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weird spaces in their life,</v>

1185
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1186
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:03.390
<v Speaker 4>man show the secretary that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't around for a lot of it </v>

1187
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 4>because you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately I work 14 hours a day.</v>

1188
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Then man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shelf for four hours.</v>

1189
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 4>They need to do an hour at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>store for 30 minutes about her.</v>

1190
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.390
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't know what you gonna sell it.</v>

1191
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like the amount that we abused </v>
<v Speaker 4>or on what we would think is a comedy </v>

1192
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me and Andy,</v>

1193
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:24.400
<v Speaker 4>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't there,</v>

1194
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:29.560
<v Speaker 4>but do it back to you guys too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it was on paper,</v>

1195
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 4>but if she had a change of heart right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now and said,</v>

1196
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:38.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be part of the me too thing </v>

1197
00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 4>and here's my story because I want to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>noticed.</v>

1198
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it to me because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>famous fortunately.</v>

1199
00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this is one of those like </v>
<v Speaker 2>swing one way and then swing back and </v>

1200
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.950
<v Speaker 2>normalize things or do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1201
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.920
<v Speaker 2>But I think it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as time goes on,</v>

1202
00:57:51.921 --> 00:57:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1203
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:58.910
<v Speaker 2>and this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not saying anything like in,</v>

1204
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 2>in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1205
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be judgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a weird idea that men,</v>

1206
00:58:05.091 --> 00:58:10.091
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're working together in small </v>

1207
00:58:10.091 --> 00:58:10.760
<v Speaker 2>boxes for long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year on year,</v>

1208
00:58:10.761 --> 00:58:15.761
<v Speaker 2>that becomes their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that becomes the way they think </v>

1209
00:58:15.761 --> 00:58:15.761
<v Speaker 2>about the outside world.</v>

1210
00:58:15.761 --> 00:58:20.450
<v Speaker 4>This is us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is really important because in </v>

1211
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:24.141
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the man shall remember we had to do </v>

1212
00:58:24.141 --> 00:58:24.930
<v Speaker 4>sexual harassment training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.050
<v Speaker 4>For a show that's basically about sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>harassment.</v>

1214
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:30.570
<v Speaker 4>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in comedy,</v>

1215
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:35.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think that we can get away with all </v>

1216
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:37.170
<v Speaker 4>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I find myself extrapolating that on a</v>

1217
00:58:37.171 --> 00:58:42.171
<v Speaker 4>people that are in a workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it's like to work in </v>

1218
00:58:42.171 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 4>an office where the boss says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1219
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:47.220
<v Speaker 4>you can move up to assistant regional </v>
<v Speaker 4>director if you watch me jerk off.</v>

1220
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.480
<v Speaker 4>And that's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

1221
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:55.610
<v Speaker 4>that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the man is the only time I've kind </v>

1222
00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:59.411
<v Speaker 4>of hit like the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cross corners of comedy meets corporate </v>

1223
00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 4>where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone might be in the story I have in </v>

1224
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:08.211
<v Speaker 4>here that I couldn't have known when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn this book in final draft that this </v>

1225
00:59:08.791 --> 00:59:10.710
<v Speaker 4>current climate would exist.</v>

1226
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.830
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a bunch of stories.</v>

1227
00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Where do you remember mandic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the mandate waves?</v>

1228
00:59:18.331 --> 00:59:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I get a assistant producer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>director guy.</v>

1229
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.960
<v Speaker 4>He was one that we all fucking hated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just a ruthless Douche.</v>

1230
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.540
<v Speaker 4>And then when we went up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the story that's in the book at </v>

1231
00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.860

<v Speaker 4>We did the match.</v>

1246
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:08.580
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bummed me out because like they were </v>

1247
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.881
<v Speaker 2>crying and some of them wouldn't montage</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wished that that had been the </v>

1248
01:00:12.101 --> 01:00:15.010
<v Speaker 2>case and that someone would come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue them.</v>

1249
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't funny.</v>

1259
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:38.761
<v Speaker 2>things have happened that lead me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that I have a lot of like a </v>

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Scotsman I pulled out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can't remember why we were so fucked.</v>

1337
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.370
<v Speaker 4>I've been begging him not to air it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know what I said,</v>

1338
01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:06.480
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen Ari's Dick About 100 times</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1339
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:11.510
<v Speaker 4>So for the book I sent a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures with Hennigan to pick and </v>

1340
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 4>choose and then they took all these dick</v>
<v Speaker 4>pics of me in public and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just my Dick.</v>

1342
01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:21.120
<v Speaker 4>So I had to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this one I decided on this not having</v>

1343
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:26.121
<v Speaker 4>any idea it could be so perfectly timed.</v>

1360
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I was doing comedy and I was a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew back in the day when we were </v>

1361
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 3>young in another millennium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just blame it on Brown.</v>

1362
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:33.300
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to guess what I just </v>

1363
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.300
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watched Louis C K jerk off in the</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1368
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 3>And as we've caught up many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years later,</v>

1369
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:43.360

<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1371
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 3>I did it because it was a story to tell </v>

1372
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.200

<v Speaker 3>Because afterwards when she said what </v>

<v Speaker 3>she told me that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never watched me jerk off.</v>

1374
01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Got To watch the beach or I pull my dick</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and put on for this.</v>

1375
01:06:00.551 --> 01:06:01.830
<v Speaker 3>You Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch.</v>

1376
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just said,</v>

1377
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1378
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She like.</v>

1379
01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 3>It's no fun if you don't watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way I remember it is that she </v>

1380
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 3>remembers me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't like it,</v>

1381
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 3>don't look either way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a goof.</v>

1382
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 3>She were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to stand up to.</v>

1383
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I think what we should do to normalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole.</v>

1384
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Luis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on.</v>

1385
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 3>This is the important part of this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I said,</v>

1386
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:25.110
<v Speaker 3>are you going to come out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can't because she just did it </v>

1387
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:28.831
<v Speaker 3>because it was funny of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she would almost be putting a place </v>

1388
01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:33.670
<v Speaker 3>where she would be as it's people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that made him into a monster.</v>

1389
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 3>We're just kind of a goof back that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one cared.</v>

1390
01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:42.540
<v Speaker 3>It's only weird and it was very polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I heard the Louis ck stories </v>

1391
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:45.520
<v Speaker 3>later on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just assumed it was like that.</v>

1392
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 3>He was very polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1393
01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:49.840
<v Speaker 3>would you watch me jerk off?</v>

1394
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard from someone else that I had</v>

1395
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:58.710
<v Speaker 3>talked to someone who had gotten the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story from Louis and the version of it </v>

1396
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:03.001
<v Speaker 3>through the grape vine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't take this as like verbatim was </v>

1397
01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 3>something along the lines of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1398
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought it was silly to like pull his</v>

1399
01:07:06.611 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 3>dick out and take pictures with them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had heard that he was saying that</v>

1400
01:07:10.211 --> 01:07:15.211
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't actually masturbate in front </v>

1401
01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:15.280
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like one version of it.</v>

1402
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1403
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:21.301
<v Speaker 3>well maybe that what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the full story came out and I </v>

1404
01:07:21.301 --> 01:07:21.301
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh okay.</v>

1405
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.650
<v Speaker 3>And then someone had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1406
01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but he asked them first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1407
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing with this?</v>

1408
01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:33.580
<v Speaker 3>This is another important beat is my </v>
<v Speaker 3>story happened before he was in any </v>

1409
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>position of power other than comics </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked up to him.</v>

1410
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.090
<v Speaker 3>He was still writing for comics that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've had some power at at best.</v>

1411
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:46.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a man and you have your alone </v>

1412
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:49.630
<v Speaker 3>in a room with a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is my perception of it.</v>

1413
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 3>It's always a power thing because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking weird because you can kill them.</v>

1414
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like have you ever been around like a </v>

1415
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:00.760
<v Speaker 3>UFC athletes on big giant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a place where you go,</v>

1416
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this was a tinder date,</v>

1417
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 3>this happened in a place where you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to meet you in public,</v>

1418
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 3>so don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1419
01:08:08.081 --> 01:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>it was completely safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1420
01:08:10.511 --> 01:08:15.511
<v Speaker 3>but if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're alone in a room with a </v>

1421
01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:15.511
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like being an,</v>

1422
01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>you know that a</v>

1423
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 2>man has some sexual urges directed </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards you and you're a woman.</v>

1424
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.880
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a vulnerable situation and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird shit where someone.</v>

1425
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.240
<v Speaker 2>If let's say someone was blocking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door because I had heard that Louis </v>

1426
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>didn't block any doors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes really crazy.</v>

1427
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1428
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing.</v>

1429
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:42.731
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also like I think the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people have the hardest time with </v>

1431
01:08:42.731 --> 01:08:47.231
<v Speaker 2>all of this is you never want to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's possible that someone would do</v>

1432
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>something horrible to somebody if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>

1433
01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with all of this,</v>

1434
01:08:55.161 --> 01:09:00.161
<v Speaker 2>with any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Kevin Spacey or any of </v>

1435
01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:00.161
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you liked him as an actor.</v>

1436
01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great on house of cards.</v>

1437
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you really just terrorizing people </v>

1438
01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:06.340
<v Speaker 2>and grabbing dicks everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1439
01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep people around time.</v>

1440
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

1441
01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I still grab ass and Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1442
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.230
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1443
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I think about it that way at my house </v>
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>

1444
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you guys.</v>

1445
01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 2>We had a party the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1446
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:22.320
<v Speaker 2>who have I not got groped in </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately.</v>

1447
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1448
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Gill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it to you and I grabbed </v>

1449
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:28.480
<v Speaker 2>his dick just to make sure that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all fucking good.</v>

1450
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Never groped me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to feel a little left out.</v>

1451
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't think nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think you've ever gotten </v>

1452
01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I might've googled it from afar.</v>

1453
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I think you might have spanked me once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point being it's like,</v>

1454
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta just people have to figure out </v>

1455
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.591
<v Speaker 2>some way to interface with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent of the time as equal and </v>

1456
01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>just work on your own bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the way you talk to people,</v>

1457
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:55.510
<v Speaker 2>like somebody brought this up once that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they initially with a lot of this stuff </v>

1458
01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:00.280
<v Speaker 2>is that it's someone in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>business that's in this position of </v>

1459
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 2>being a great artist like Kevin Spacey </v>
<v Speaker 2>type character or whatever,</v>

1460
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:08.590
<v Speaker 2>and then the other person is like a pa </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that and he prays on </v>

1461
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:11.410
<v Speaker 2>them and it's his show and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away and he's like attacking them.</v>

1462
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:13.270
<v Speaker 2>They're straight and these gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1463
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I know that 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's some weird,</v>

1464
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:23.081
<v Speaker 2>almost like reptilian instinct that </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans can't tell you how many times </v>

1465
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:28.931
<v Speaker 2>we've had to because you know my </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience overserved quite a bit of the </v>

1466
01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:34.301
<v Speaker 2>time and when it's a girl that's alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see the packs of guys.</v>

1467
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

1468
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you live?</v>

1469
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1470
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:45.431
<v Speaker 2>Let's get her an uber because I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to go poorly and you know </v>

1471
01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.990
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's really fucked up.</v>

1472
01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Not only was the woman the like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable one when it comes to like the</v>

1473
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 2>possibility of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1474
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:59.410
<v Speaker 2>She's also the vulnerable one when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to her reputation because like if </v>

1475
01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you and like chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1476
01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:03.650
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you and Bert Kreischer and five dudes</v>

1477
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:08.651
<v Speaker 2>and a girl hops in the car with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she decides to suck everybody off and </v>

1478
01:11:08.651 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>then you tell the world and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaks her name and they're like,</v>

1479
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 2>it hurts her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get up,</v>

1480
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>if you're hitchhiking</v>

1481
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>and you get picked up by six chicks who </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to below you and film it and put</v>

1482
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>it on the Internet and you're cracking </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes and pitching your book,</v>

1483
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:25.410
<v Speaker 3>your book was chicken sucking your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a king.</v>

1484
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.560
<v Speaker 3>You're a Goddamn king that's worship you</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they'll throw up a red carpet </v>

1485
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.061
<v Speaker 3>down in front of your van.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you get out and bowed to you as you </v>

1486
01:11:35.061 --> 01:11:35.061
<v Speaker 3>climb out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>send.</v>

1487
01:11:35.061 --> 01:11:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Another huge issue is how we treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1488
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Being able to guide their own sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 100,</v>

1489
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.800
<v Speaker 3>that's a big part of what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise your daughters in a different way </v>

1490
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.461
<v Speaker 3>than you raise your sons and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay for a teacher to fuck a boy </v>

1491
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1492
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is.</v>

1493
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:54.210
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're won't even say a word.</v>

1494
01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:59.340
<v Speaker 3>It should be treated the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should raise your kids to know about</v>

1495
01:11:59.341 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>

1496
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:01.790
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you raised your daughters,</v>

1497
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say this as long as it's a </v>

1498
01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.051
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you raised your daughter with the </v>

1499
01:12:09.051 --> 01:12:11.181
<v Speaker 3>same openness that you raise your son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd know not to fuck a 35 year old </v>

1500
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 3>soccer coach when she's 15 because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were open.</v>

1501
01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 3>You told her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the pitfalls of life.</v>

1502
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:20.850
<v Speaker 3>This is what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys are going to try to buck you.</v>

1503
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You caught all women and I believe it's </v>

1504
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.300
<v Speaker 3>as much a parenting problem as anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1505
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.360
<v Speaker 3>It really is fucking fascinating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have no problem if a really </v>

1506
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.231
<v Speaker 3>hot teacher fucked your 16 year old son </v>
<v Speaker 3>for really hot woman teacher like built </v>

1507
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:41.610
<v Speaker 3>like Pamela Anderson back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Baywatch days if somehow they teach it.</v>

1508
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:42.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1509
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1510
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.840
<v Speaker 3>you should be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminating.</v>

1511
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 3>But if it was a hot one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no problem with it.</v>

1512
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Some Pamela Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Gao is having sex with your 17 year</v>

1513
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.070
<v Speaker 3>old boy and he's got a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1514
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have Tommy who were a winner.</v>

1515
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 3>But if you reverse the genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrific offense.</v>

1516
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Like some handsome man has reduced your </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful little daughter who's only 17.</v>

1517
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy needs to be in a cage.</v>

1518
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Appeared that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that alone is like,</v>

1519
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:18.231
<v Speaker 3>this is where I can't extend the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument because I've never been a </v>

1520
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1521
01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I've been meaning to talk</v>

1522
01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 3>to you about saving a lot of this for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

1523
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:30.201
<v Speaker 3>I have hosts can a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when we were going to </v>

1524
01:13:30.201 --> 01:13:30.201
<v Speaker 3>get married?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:13:30.201 --> 01:13:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That was the last call I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

1526
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's in the book or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1527
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.600
<v Speaker 3>The last call I made when we knew the </v>
<v Speaker 3>man show is going to get canceled.</v>

1528
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.010
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be in the book.</v>

1529
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1530
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last call I made,</v>

1531
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't tell us it's canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They leave you hanging on the vine.</v>

1532
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:48.590
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1533
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Atlanta punchline and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember being in the parking lot and </v>

1534
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts had just passed gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage or civil unions,</v>

1535
01:13:56.870 --> 01:14:00.360
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called Zoe Friedman first.</v>

1536
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Zoe Friedman was called Zoiah before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>checked on me.</v>

1537
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I called you first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's the one that counted because </v>

1538
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 3>she was our goto person at comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>central.</v>

1539
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.410
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1540
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 3>before you us,</v>

1541
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v Speaker 4>give us one last episode where Jo and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get gay married and it just goes into </v>

1542
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:22.861
<v Speaker 4>this montage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the opposite of every marriage </v>

1543
01:14:22.861 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 4>cliche where we're fishing together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's arguing,</v>

1544
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.760
<v Speaker 4>no one's fighting over the remote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all happy.</v>

1545
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.890
<v Speaker 4>We're both happy to be watching the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and it's just a perfect life </v>

1546
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:34.890
<v Speaker 4>together</v>

1547
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:36.200
<v Speaker 2>to imagine that people decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1548
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if they had best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get married as best friends,</v>

1549
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:41.540
<v Speaker 2>like it's nothing sexual in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>

1550
01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Zero sexual obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sex.</v>

1551
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like you are getting married as </v>
<v Speaker 2>best friends like for real than Bros </v>

1552
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>before hoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stop and think about how many,</v>

1553
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:55.460
<v Speaker 2>not obviously not the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships we're involved in.</v>

1554
01:14:55.461 --> 01:15:00.461
<v Speaker 2>We would never go so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go back to like your </v>

1555
01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:02.861
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine being stuck with some gap </v>

1556
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:03.680
<v Speaker 2>when you're both God damn wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1557
01:15:03.681 --> 01:15:06.260
<v Speaker 2>You're both crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're both 21 or whatever the fuck you.</v>

1558
01:15:06.261 --> 01:15:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You both completely out of your mind.</v>

1559
01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:09.710
<v Speaker 2>You're basically babies alone in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1560
01:15:09.711 --> 01:15:11.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1561
01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Imagine living with that Gal for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of your life versus your friend </v>

1562
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:20.351
<v Speaker 2>from back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still friends with my buddies from </v>

1563
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:20.510
<v Speaker 2>when I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy lawless.</v>

1564
01:15:20.511 --> 01:15:25.511
<v Speaker 2>I talked to that dude all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We text each other back and forth all </v>

1565
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:28.451
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been friends with him since I was </v>

1566
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:28.451
<v Speaker 2>15 or 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might've been 14 when I met him.</v>

1567
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug.</v>

1568
01:15:29.311 --> 01:15:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I hate your cigarette smoke during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

1569
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.210
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>

1571
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.670

<v Speaker 2>That's our marriage beef.</v>

1572

<v Speaker 2>This is our meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I really did.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right behind him and turn that thing on </v>

1576
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:56.721
<v Speaker 2>just to suck out the cigarette smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's either that the air </v>

<v Speaker 2>It was me and my girlfriend Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were parked out in front of my </v>

1594
01:16:48.631 --> 01:16:53.631
<v Speaker 2>house and we were listening to a dice </v>
<v Speaker 2>clay cassette in my car and we were </v>

<v Speaker 2>I was 19,</v>

01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:34.391
<v Speaker 3>Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two guys that are way funnier than </v>

1827
01:27:34.391 --> 01:27:37.571
<v Speaker 3>me and a fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never could put it together on </v>

1828
01:27:37.571 --> 01:27:37.571
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

1829
01:27:37.571 --> 01:27:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to be as much as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to be like you.</v>

1830
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1831
01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 3>You know those funny people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1832
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

1833
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I want to steal that essence because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to put it on stage.</v>

1834
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Never be naturally off the cuff as funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the funniest people I've met,</v>

1835
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:57.380
<v Speaker 3>but I can do it on stage and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fuck you.</v>

1836
01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ruthless.</v>

1837
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can boil down the organization.</v>

1838
01:28:02.461 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of writer </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondent he should have.</v>

1839
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:10.990
<v Speaker 3>You should have a policy that sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>harassment is mandatory and everybody </v>

1840
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:15.611
<v Speaker 3>works inside the Doug Stan Hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Information Collection Organization like</v>

1841
01:28:15.831 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 3>anybody's trying to help you with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>creation of your act idea gathering.</v>

1842
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.660
<v Speaker 3>What have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an unspoken each other until now.</v>

1843
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of the thing and that's why we</v>

1844
01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:31.730
<v Speaker 3>were talking about the no one's meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing rock and roll bands.</v>

1845
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not pulling led Zeppelin's </v>
<v Speaker 3>library off of itunes because they </v>

1846
01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:38.330
<v Speaker 3>fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked a girl with a fish.</v>

1847
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 3>But here's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you walk into the backstage area at</v>

1848
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 3>a rock'n'roll concert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an unwritten rule.</v>

1849
01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1850
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:51.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roadie tapped you on the shoulder </v>

1851
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.340
<v Speaker 3>for a reason and you know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason is I was made to feel </v>

1852
01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:58.571
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled out his dick out of sweaty </v>

1853
01:28:58.571 --> 01:29:00.200
<v Speaker 3>leather pants after the show underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No underwear.</v>

1854
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 3>And then girls were bumps off</v>

1855
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1856
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:07.940
<v Speaker 2>they were gunners mostly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball sweat a governors.</v>

1857
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I understand there's a difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and what happens with </v>

1858
01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:16.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking rapist.</v>

1859
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1860
01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And here's the part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem is that what we were</v>

1861
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:24.321
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you got in a car with seven </v>

1862
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:24.321
<v Speaker 2>women and they all fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a hero,</v>

1863
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 2>would have a gal gets in the car with </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

1864
01:29:26.221 --> 01:29:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Jason Mamoa was that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy from the game of thrones,</v>

1865
01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>that fucking beautiful handsome man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gigantic cancer man,</v>

1866
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:37.910
<v Speaker 2>he's so huge and so beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have seven of those were in a car </v>

1867
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.010
<v Speaker 2>and it was a gal and she was just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>ravaged,</v>

1868
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.720
<v Speaker 2>ravaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's some sort of a damage thing.</v>

1869
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 2>We know those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know those girls that celebrate that.</v>

1870
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1871
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:49.440
<v Speaker 2>We know the ones that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1872
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I fucked that guy.</v>

1873
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I know a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1874
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.170
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That are just like,</v>

1875
01:29:55.171 --> 01:30:00.171
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be like that for </v>

1876
01:30:00.171 --> 01:30:00.171
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a suppression issue.</v>

1877
01:30:00.171 --> 01:30:00.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the same reason why Catholics feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty.</v>

1878
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not a matter of why what's wrong or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's right.</v>

1879
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:08.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of what you enjoy and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't enjoy it because other people </v>

1880
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:11.861
<v Speaker 2>are going to judge you for it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get to the root of why </v>

1881
01:30:11.861 --> 01:30:14.301
<v Speaker 2>these people judging it for a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the men that judge women </v>

1882
01:30:14.301 --> 01:30:15.270
<v Speaker 2>for their sexual activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent out of jealousy,</v>

1883
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:20.770
<v Speaker 2>so 100 percent out of the idea that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman would not want to do that with </v>

1884
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:24.021
<v Speaker 2>them and they cast a judgement on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they decided that her needs are </v>

1885
01:30:24.021 --> 01:30:25.170
<v Speaker 2>different than our than the demands </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

1886
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.320
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is all these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>were established back when it was really</v>

1887
01:30:28.321 --> 01:30:33.321
<v Speaker 2>difficult to have children and you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect your children and most of </v>

1888
01:30:33.321 --> 01:30:34.530
<v Speaker 2>them are going to die and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally concerned about the population</v>

1889
01:30:34.531 --> 01:30:35.250
<v Speaker 2>of your village.</v>

1890
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those instincts,</v>

1891
01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:41.650
<v Speaker 2>they still exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that's not a concern </v>

1892
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:41.650
<v Speaker 2>anymore and then this fucking birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and whatever,</v>

1893
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:41.820
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

1894
01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That chick came out.</v>

1895
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.200
<v Speaker 2>When did that come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the chick start being superheroes </v>

1896
01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:51.300
<v Speaker 2>was a early seventies when roe versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wade and control and all that.</v>

1897
01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be even,</v>

1898
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1899
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:59.320
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some sort of a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it even easier than all this has </v>

1900
01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.790
<v Speaker 2>gotta be a way where you let the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones will think what has happened is</v>

1901
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.580
<v Speaker 2>60 and nailed it to nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it did.</v>

1902
01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought were going to make the </v>

1903
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:11.940
<v Speaker 2>argument for bringing back villages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1904
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1905
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cities are amazing,</v>

1906
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:20.600
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we're designed for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we will be ready for it and </v>

1907
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.861
<v Speaker 2>a couple hundred years it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take some sort of an adaptation to the </v>

1908
01:31:23.861 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 2>human psyche and the way we interact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>

1909
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's totally doable if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like us can do it.</v>

1910
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:33.890
<v Speaker 2>This is how I've always felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the entire world was the four of us </v>

1911
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be fine.</v>

1912
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Like what if we were the only people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what if we were immortal?</v>

1913
01:31:37.861 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have to worry about dying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just the four of us and it just a</v>

1914
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 2>bunch of food and shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we would have any problem </v>

1915
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 2>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1916
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:46.800
<v Speaker 2>we would miss the fact that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He checks.</v>

1917
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:50.340
<v Speaker 2>That'd be kind of a bummer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would probably have a good time.</v>

1918
01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:53.370
<v Speaker 2>We just had unlimited resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman around,</v>

1919
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.880
<v Speaker 2>which we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the,</v>

1921
01:31:56.101 --> 01:32:01.101
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world like wildfire in Ventura </v>

1922
01:32:01.101 --> 01:32:01.101
<v Speaker 2>spreads</v>

1923
01:32:01.101 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 3>across the world while this podcast goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>on and on,</v>

1924
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 3>and then we walk out and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1925
01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking Zombie apocalypse without the </v>
<v Speaker 3>zombies.</v>

1926
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 3>The zombies kicking into that of ashes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent those on the grill.</v>

1927
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:20.390
<v Speaker 3>They showed us how to use it could press</v>
<v Speaker 3>buttons and I'm going to have to drink </v>

1928
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.390
<v Speaker 3>stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1929
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll get irritated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do me a favor.</v>

1930
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Give them a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1931
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:24.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1932
01:32:24.581 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>

1933
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:28.440
<v Speaker 3>You're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just try it.</v>

1934
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's hot in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm actually sweating from the gears</v>

1935
01:32:32.711 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 3>and I thought it's because Joe Rogan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bellowing so much.</v>

1936
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm bleeding out of my earphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1937
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sweating on your earphones and </v>

1938
01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.230
<v Speaker 3>whoever sits here next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's OCD because.</v>

1939
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Are you a just leapt up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire it up.</v>

1940
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be too loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1941
01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one was giving me shit.</v>

1942
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never know when you're being </v>

1943
01:32:56.970 --> 01:32:56.970
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1944
01:32:56.970 --> 01:33:00.041
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am sweating from my earphones and I </v>

1945
01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 3>think that's gross that I'm sweating on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your earphone so I had to say it.</v>

1946
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about period blood.</v>

1947
01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bothers me.</v>

1948
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen people do bother me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I am everything.</v>

1949
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that they find to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1950
01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm filthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should eat meat with 30 </v>

1951
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:20.980
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

1952
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you should eat meat with dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I know someone's OCD,</v>

1953
01:33:24.281 --> 01:33:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid to be around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm comfortable.</v>

1954
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who went to look at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and they were looking at the house</v>

1955
01:33:31.661 --> 01:33:33.670
<v Speaker 3>and as a nice house like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this house beautiful.</v>

1956
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.480
<v Speaker 3>And then they got to this one closet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closet was filled with Purell,</v>

1957
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 3>with hand sanitizer and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

1958
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Like this house is haunted my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude,</v>

1959
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.810
<v Speaker 3>the fucking thing was filled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a closet.</v>

1960
01:33:52.811 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It was filled from the floor all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the top of pure route.</v>

1961
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.590
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew stern and ONA.</v>

1962
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1963
01:34:00.611 --> 01:34:05.611
<v Speaker 3>and a one of them at least they were all</v>
<v Speaker 3>purell touching everything and if I get </v>

1964
01:34:06.731 --> 01:34:11.731
<v Speaker 3>a cold and my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guttural smoker's cough is enough </v>

1965
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.260
<v Speaker 3>that you're gonna not want me here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cough off Mike.</v>

1966
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know he's going to hear it and go.</v>

1967
01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Think about how many people you interact</v>
<v Speaker 3>with and shake hands with.</v>

1968
01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I think the more people you share your </v>
<v Speaker 3>biome with,</v>

1969
01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 3>like Paul stamets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mushroom guy,</v>

1970
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has some pretty famous mycologist </v>

1971
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 3>who's on my podcast really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing stories,</v>

1972
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.851
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you come in contact with </v>

1973
01:34:38.851 --> 01:34:41.371
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their biome interacts with your biome </v>

1974
01:34:41.371 --> 01:34:41.371
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1975
01:34:41.371 --> 01:34:44.590
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a residual amount of DNA </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're taking into your own biome.</v>

1976
01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you meet somebody,</v>

1977
01:34:46.691 --> 01:34:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you become part of them and some very </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre way.</v>

1978
01:34:48.671 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1979
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:52.260
<v Speaker 3>He's like intro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce in like,</v>

1980
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.670

<v Speaker 3>welcome to my home,</v>

1981
01:34:53.671 --> 01:34:54.940
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

1982
01:34:55.570 --> 01:35:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a scientist so he's not like just </v>

1983
01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.210
<v Speaker 3>bullshitting and he's not like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy dude who doesn't believe in birds.</v>

1984
01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You told me something on a podcast years</v>

1985
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:14.690
<v Speaker 3>ago and it's one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up late at night where I go,</v>

1986
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I want to call Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to call you at 1130 at</v>

1987
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:21.080
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was the thing that you said?</v>

1988
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call me anytime you call me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>call me please.</v>

1990
01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see.</v>

1991
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you see love to use a quote from you </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the back of this book?</v>

1992
01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1993
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 3>I called people that if they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not friends.</v>

1994
01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Rock said No.</v>

1995
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1996
01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 3>he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he is.</v>

1997
01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:45.160
<v Speaker 3>He wrote me a better quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He then I would have.</v>

1998
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I would love to quote your book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1999
01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Don't ever asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean don't ever worry about asking me.</v>

2000
01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to put anyone on the spot.</v>

2001
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll put me on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

2002
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had one of my favorite people.</v>

2003
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:58.580
<v Speaker 3>If I have a top 20 people that survived </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody dies,</v>

2004
01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:02.230
<v Speaker 3>you're in like if there was like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an apocalypse though,</v>

2005
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we'll work on it with a side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gained like five of year free.</v>

2006
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:09.740
<v Speaker 3>So I got five of mind family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever need to know this still alive.</v>

2007
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.280
<v Speaker 3>You told me something about over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of I think 20 years,</v>

2008
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 3>the amount of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cells.</v>

2009
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 3>You're not even the same person you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years.</v>

2010
01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Tell it with your smart way of saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2011
01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2012
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:27.290
<v Speaker 3>this is like third hand smart way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm clearly a retard,</v>

2013
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.560
<v Speaker 3>but if you go back to like seven years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and then today you literally don't </v>

2014
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:35.900
<v Speaker 3>have the same cells in most of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2015
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.900
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that doesn't regenerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the neurons,</v>

2016
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:43.160
<v Speaker 3>the neurons do not regenerate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every cell in your body is different</v>

2017
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:45.320
<v Speaker 3>than the cells in your body from seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

2018
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.860
<v Speaker 3>So what are your memories remain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is part of the problem.</v>

2019
01:36:48.861 --> 01:36:53.861
<v Speaker 3>It's become you become a victim to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>momentum of your past behavior and </v>

2020
01:36:53.861 --> 01:36:56.430
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're Kevin Spacey,</v>

2021
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you decided six months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not grabbing any more dicks.</v>

2022
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking done with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a better person.</v>

2023
01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Like you are attached the momentum of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your past behavior.</v>

2024
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what,</v>

2025
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.090
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not even that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

2026
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.260
<v Speaker 3>like seven years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wake up,</v>

2027
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:15.680
<v Speaker 3>you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2028
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:17.920
<v Speaker 3>what did I grab?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grab some decks.</v>

2029
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

2030
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.750
<v Speaker 6>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Granted,</v>

2031
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.060
<v Speaker 6>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2032
01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.460
<v Speaker 6>I was so drunk.</v>

2033
01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:32.100
<v Speaker 3>That's something you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're stuck with that idea like we </v>

2034
01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:32.100
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to get past that.</v>

2035
01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.410
<v Speaker 3>We have to figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Pi,</v>

2036
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.680
<v Speaker 3>they have to take those electric things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking change your brain.</v>

2037
01:37:37.681 --> 01:37:42.681
<v Speaker 3>Like she like shock therapy and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll let you ride when you don't </v>

2038
01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.970
<v Speaker 3>account for growth and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my huge thing.</v>

2039
01:37:47.971 --> 01:37:49.510
<v Speaker 3>If I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2040
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 3>a charity that I was behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was on dancing with the stars,</v>

2041
01:37:54.811 --> 01:37:59.750
<v Speaker 3>which think is going to be in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations were going on in.</v>

2042
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2043
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:06.830

2045
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 3>He wants to die by the innocence </v>
<v Speaker 3>project.</v>

2046
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then let's go back to dancing with </v>

2048
01:38:17.211 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Joe Innocence project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my thing.</v>

2049
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:20.370

<v Speaker 3>innocent.</v>

2051
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my fear.</v>

2052
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 3>And when you terrifying fear of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire prison system,</v>

2053
01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:35.130
<v Speaker 3>the justice system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prison doesn't work whatsoever.</v>

2054
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:40.130
<v Speaker 3>And when you lock someone up at 18 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old for some shit you,</v>

2055
01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:44.370
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grow out of these things,</v>

2056
01:38:44.371 --> 01:38:47.460
<v Speaker 3>like you're not accepting that as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>

2057
01:38:47.461 --> 01:38:50.060
<v Speaker 3>you rethink things and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's full.</v>

2058
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>It's totally ineffective way to reform </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as well.</v>

2059
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Most prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some prisons are trying to be more </v>

2060
01:38:58.460 --> 01:38:58.460
<v Speaker 3>progressive with their scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland,</v>

2061
01:38:58.470 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly outside of America.</v>

2062
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:06.021
<v Speaker 3>America has a real problem and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real problems is there's not all of </v>

2063
01:39:06.021 --> 01:39:06.280
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a certain amount of the press.</v>

2064
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For profit and these private prison </v>

2065
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.310
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime something's for profit,</v>

2066
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:15.860
<v Speaker 3>the system benefits from these laws </v>
<v Speaker 3>being uniform or increasing in severity </v>

2067
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:23.061
<v Speaker 3>and like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have like a way where people </v>

2068
01:39:23.061 --> 01:39:25.971
<v Speaker 3>can profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this was the issue that I had with </v>

2069
01:39:25.971 --> 01:39:25.971
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

2070
01:39:25.971 --> 01:39:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Will you would find out that prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard unions would be lobbying against </v>

2071
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:31.500
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2072
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police having done so well and what are </v>

2073
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:38.840
<v Speaker 3>we like our 45 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Stepping on my new bits because </v>

2074
01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.950
<v Speaker 3>that's all I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of stuff.</v>

2075
01:39:40.951 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 3>But all of the things we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2076
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about Brian with Brian on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day and we were talking about </v>

2077
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.930
<v Speaker 3>something and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2078
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about this in my act </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

2079
01:39:48.931 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 3>of course you have because this is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really relevant today and I think</v>

2080
01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:57.531
<v Speaker 3>that all of us have this weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we don't want to step on each </v>

2081
01:39:57.531 --> 01:40:00.201
<v Speaker 3>other's material and let of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see some of the same </v>

2082
01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 3>things that I'm seeing and I want to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>your take on it as much as I want to see</v>

2083
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:02.000
<v Speaker 3>my take on it.</v>

2084
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2085
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying not to do punch line as key </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the discourse and not go into bit.</v>

2086
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

2087
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's those bits are good,</v>

2088
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.370
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to give them up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2089
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:19.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and honestly this one bit that goes with</v>

2090
01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:24.591
<v Speaker 3>the entire rape thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been missing just one ceiling </v>

2091
01:40:24.661 --> 01:40:29.661
<v Speaker 3>chunk of this bit that's sometimes goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>25 minutes of too long and I just trying</v>

2092
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:38.601
<v Speaker 3>to get the point across and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>current climate as I keep calling it has</v>

2093
01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 3>me like that's what I was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have specific examples of this guy</v>

2094
01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:50.331
<v Speaker 3>versus this guy now it made the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit come together and now I'm off the </v>

2095
01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:55.911
<v Speaker 3>road until March or like motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I actually want to go out and do </v>

2096
01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 3>more dates just because this a year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a half I think I've been working on this</v>

2097
01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:02.800
<v Speaker 3>bucket and one stupid bit that happens.</v>

2098
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 3>You know Chris Rock said that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on that.</v>

2099
01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I love black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate niggers and remember that.</v>

2100
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who says it?</v>

2101
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:13.430
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't white man doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

2102
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:18.280
<v Speaker 3>It is in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the all time greatest,</v>

2103
01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:22.930
<v Speaker 3>most significant standup comedy bits </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever and when it hit,</v>

2104
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was just kind of starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>out when that bit was like popular on </v>

2105
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:32.911
<v Speaker 3>that bit was like on cds and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would play it back and you'd see it on </v>

2106
01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:32.911
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

2107
01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

2108
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:36.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like a perfect bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he had it boiled down.</v>

2109
01:41:36.731 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 3>The punch lines were so succinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just Bam,</v>

2110
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

2111
01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.680
<v Speaker 3>And then I read that he had bombed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pit for months and months before he</v>

2112
01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:50.910
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to get it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got hate mail from fan.</v>

2113
01:41:50.911 --> 01:41:53.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not like agregious actually.</v>

2114
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2115
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with most of what you say,</v>

2116
01:41:57.371 --> 01:41:59.740
<v Speaker 3>but what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you saying?</v>

2117
01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2118
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:02.800
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm trying to not say,</v>

2119
01:42:02.801 --> 01:42:05.800
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having such a hard time alliterating</v>

2120
01:42:05.801 --> 01:42:10.000
<v Speaker 3>this and everything that's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last month or two has,</v>

2121
01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.240
<v Speaker 3>oh now I can exactly point out what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2122
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:17.110
<v Speaker 3>And I actually have reverse engineered </v>
<v Speaker 3>it where I go,</v>

2123
01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be starting from where I was</v>

2124
01:42:19.181 --> 01:42:24.181
<v Speaker 3>ending and then go the other way rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than apologizing and yeah.</v>

2125
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's been boarded out right when I </v>

2126
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.610
<v Speaker 3>get off the road fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you'll,</v>

2127
01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:34.810
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't an always kinda like fucking.</v>

2128
01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it keeps going like it's done in a new </v>

2129
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Speaker 3>branch pops out of the tree and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2130
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's going to bear fruit for.</v>

2131
01:42:44.010 --> 01:42:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I was doing these shitty gigs for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking months and every night I hated </v>

2132
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:51.030
<v Speaker 3>going onstage and now I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage,</v>

2133
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.250
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2134
01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.700
<v Speaker 3>what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've found pretty recently,</v>

2135
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:59.760
<v Speaker 3>like within the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean is that that is all like some </v>

2136
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.091
<v Speaker 3>shit that I internalize and then if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can just like it express or,</v>

2137
01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.860
<v Speaker 3>or respond to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least amount.</v>

2138
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Like all the weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it exists.</v>

2139
01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I have a weird set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too long.</v>

2140
01:43:10.121 --> 01:43:12.700
<v Speaker 3>It's too this too that I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it exists.</v>

2141
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't freak out,</v>

2142
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:18.130
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but understand what that is and then you</v>

2143
01:43:18.131 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 3>know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it didn't work.</v>

2144
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Now let's figure out how to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>never let that happen again because </v>

2145
01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:28.641
<v Speaker 3>there's a big difference with the swing </v>
<v Speaker 3>between like the audience having a </v>

2146
01:43:28.641 --> 01:43:31.351
<v Speaker 3>fucking amazing time or it was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for 45 minutes that suck for 10 </v>

2147
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:32.740
<v Speaker 3>like shit.</v>

2148
01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:37.770
<v Speaker 3>There is no better learning experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens for decades than eating </v>

2149
01:43:40.691 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing will ever make you know,</v>

2150
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:46.120
<v Speaker 3>come back stronger than actually dying </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your ass.</v>

2151
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:51.630
<v Speaker 3>But I'd rather be mediocre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even mediocre like eating shit dude,</v>

2152
01:43:53.781 --> 01:43:58.781
<v Speaker 3>I ain't shit after Jim Brewer in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird suburb outside of the city in New </v>

2153
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.080
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shit so hard.</v>

2154
01:44:03.081 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 3>It changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not recently.</v>

2155
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.200
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like 93,</v>

2156
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:15.920
<v Speaker 3>maybe [inaudible] 93 and brewer and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>just start now and I was fine.</v>

2157
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I really shouldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>headlining.</v>

2158
01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.190
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I should have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>headline.</v>

2159
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:24.191
<v Speaker 3>I had maybe 45 minutes that was mediocre</v>
<v Speaker 3>at best and brewer and I had a great </v>

2160
01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:30.071
<v Speaker 3>time all weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday two shows everything worked out </v>

2161
01:44:30.071 --> 01:44:31.040
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But although if I'm being honest,</v>

2162
01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to say that he had better sets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least two of the three shows.</v>

2163
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.370
<v Speaker 3>At least two of the three shows he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>better sets,</v>

2164
01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.680
<v Speaker 3>but I had good sets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't embarrassing.</v>

2165
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:44.840
<v Speaker 3>And then the second show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturday night he made me eat a bus load</v>

2166
01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:49.841
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bombed like the one of the wars </v>

2167
01:44:49.841 --> 01:44:53.231
<v Speaker 3>bombings ever of my career ever where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like everything that came out of my </v>

2168
01:44:54.201 --> 01:44:58.160
<v Speaker 3>mouth was a Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>brick and he destroyed in front of me.</v>

2169
01:44:58.161 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed the program.</v>

2170
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Like fucking crumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're breaking up off of the fucking low</v>

2171
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 3>hanging ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that it was,</v>

2172
01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those pipes.</v>

2173
01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Actually I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's I,</v>

2174
01:45:08.911 --> 01:45:11.890
<v Speaker 4>I think I coined that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a like a brick.</v>

2175
01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:16.270
<v Speaker 4>The words came out of my mouth like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>brick through a funnel.</v>

2176
01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.130
<v Speaker 4>It feels like you have a mouthful of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt.</v>

2177
01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 4>The one I talked to the following and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I can blame the middle.</v>

2178
01:45:29.681 --> 01:45:32.030
<v Speaker 4>Act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes they just don't like you.</v>

2179
01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.360
<v Speaker 4>The middle I can take credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2180
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:39.510
<v Speaker 4>they just hated you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one I couldn't follow for a week in </v>

2181
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Miami was Chris Porter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Porter.</v>

2182
01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Chris border.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know Chris Porter?</v>

2183
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking stoner.</v>

2184
01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Fucking thin curly hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's very funny.</v>

2185
01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:55.710
<v Speaker 4>But we're Miami Improv at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was probably 2000 and it was a,</v>

2186
01:45:56.070 --> 01:46:00.310
<v Speaker 4>an urban room black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well No,</v>

2187
01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:02.080
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there was a lot of Cuban too.</v>

2188
01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.910
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2189
01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:06.040
<v Speaker 4>maybe five white people that are scared.</v>

2190
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Sammy Sosa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuban,</v>

2191
01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.750
<v Speaker 3>1993 or Sammy Sosa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuban,</v>

2192
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.680
<v Speaker 3>2017.</v>

2193
01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Miami,</v>

2194
01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Fort Lauderdale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark.</v>

2195
01:46:15.730 --> 01:46:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Not West Palm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My girls have lived first night I,</v>

2196
01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I assumed I am getting fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just go crazy.</v>

2197
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Took on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2198
01:46:24.751 --> 01:46:25.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2199
01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:29.920
<v Speaker 4>I went there throwing fucking empty </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette packs at me on stage following</v>

2200
01:46:29.921 --> 01:46:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Chris Porter who knew all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>recent hip hoppy things.</v>

2201
01:46:33.851 --> 01:46:38.851
<v Speaker 4>He had all the current urban trends in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zack did he fucking destroyed and I'm up</v>

2202
01:46:39.911 --> 01:46:44.911
<v Speaker 4>there like kind of knew with my anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian kind of point of view and </v>

2203
01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:48.470
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vice cops have this fuck Nash.</v>

2204
01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.110
<v Speaker 4>And he closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was right after.</v>

2205
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.170
<v Speaker 4>This'll probably dated when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he was,</v>

2206
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:58.890
<v Speaker 4>it was when France wouldn't let us fly </v>
<v Speaker 4>over their airspace.</v>

2207
01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we say this point,</v>

2208
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:07.250
<v Speaker 4>that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being years later I got one of my best </v>

2209
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:11.931
<v Speaker 4>bits ever about nationalism out of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he closed on fuck France if we </v>

2210
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:15.000
<v Speaker 4>had an to save their ass in two world </v>
<v Speaker 4>wars.</v>

2211
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:20.570
<v Speaker 4>And I turned that eventually in new one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my best bits ever because I would go </v>

2212
01:47:21.571 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 4>up and I'd follow him going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2213
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris bought there.</v>

2214
01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 4>That was the French coding you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:47:27.721 --> 01:47:29.200
<v Speaker 4>As Chris bought there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

2216
01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 4>These are not door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please help us.</v>

2217
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:36.351
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it turned into that bid I did about </v>

2218
01:47:36.351 --> 01:47:39.040
<v Speaker 4>nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where if we hadn't saved the French was </v>

2219
01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:42.861
<v Speaker 4>at us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was at us guaranteeing routes in the </v>

2220
01:47:42.861 --> 01:47:44.010
<v Speaker 4>trenches and Verdun was that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be.</v>

2221
01:47:44.011 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I remember last night we were hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember saving the French.</v>

2222
01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:52.290
<v Speaker 4>I remember we went through the drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>through without a car.</v>

2223
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 4>We did a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we didn't save the French.</v>

2224
01:47:55.981 --> 01:48:00.981
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about other people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>did shit and you're taking credit for </v>

2225
01:48:00.981 --> 01:48:04.971
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nationalism does nothing but teach you </v>

2226
01:48:04.971 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 4>how to take credit for other people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishments.</v>

2227
01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 4>But the same can be said for rooting for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the raiders,</v>

2228
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:07.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2229
01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2230
01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:11.910
<v Speaker 4>Fucking warm boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2231
01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very bizarre thing that we love </v>

2232
01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 4>to do and I think it's all connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

2233
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:22.970
<v Speaker 4>Why does home field advantage work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My fucking best idea.</v>

2234
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Affable so uncomfortable in that arena </v>
<v Speaker 4>for all those other people.</v>

2235
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 4>It's my best idea that no Billy Ball </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of people in the professional </v>

2236
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:35.721
<v Speaker 4>sports leagues are picking up on field a</v>
<v Speaker 4>team of sociopath's because homefield </v>

2237
01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.850
<v Speaker 4>advantage is one of the biggest things </v>
<v Speaker 4>in sports.</v>

2238
01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:42.720
<v Speaker 4>Home field advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you feel the team of sociopath's that</v>

2239
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 4>don't care about cheers or booze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2240
01:48:45.930 --> 01:48:49.440
<v Speaker 4>there's no home field advantage anymore </v>
<v Speaker 4>because these are psychopaths that don't</v>

2241
01:48:49.441 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 4>care about cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to win and kill.</v>

2242
01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.000
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not sustainable.</v>

2243
01:48:54.001 --> 01:48:55.800
<v Speaker 4>You've got to shoot them after a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of years,</v>

2244
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:57.910
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they start wearing diamonds </v>
<v Speaker 4>in their watches,</v>

2245
01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 4>you got to shoot them in the locker room</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what happened?</v>

2246
01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:01.680
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did he die?</v>

2247
01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Like W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

2249
01:49:03.921 --> 01:49:08.921

<v Speaker 2>May Be eliminating the home team </v>

2250
01:49:08.921 --> 01:49:12.191
<v Speaker 2>advantage for NBA players hating on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The black man is tinder.</v>

2251
01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:19.381
<v Speaker 2>I want you to consider the fact that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant percentage of NBA players are </v>

2252
01:49:19.381 --> 01:49:21.730
<v Speaker 2>people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You racist fucks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and banging all these white chicks and </v>

2254
01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:31.240
<v Speaker 2>you got a problem tender home field </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage to make it easier for them.</v>

2255

<v Speaker 2>They don't have to go do work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tinder.</v>

2297
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:25.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2298
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:28.870
<v Speaker 3>talking about being at Thanksgiving at </v>
<v Speaker 3>his grandparent's house,</v>

2299
01:51:28.871 --> 01:51:32.920

2302
01:51:38.861 --> 01:51:42.640
<v Speaker 3>like you have grandchildren and </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandparents.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That means the kids are going to meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>their great,</v>

2304
01:51:46.151 --> 01:51:47.830
<v Speaker 3>great grandparents.</v>

01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 3>The only thing is maybe I want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these guys when I was a kid too.</v>

2424
01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:50.880

<v Speaker 3>Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do that for a living.</v>

2426
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Mcgee was on the podcast and we're </v>

2427
01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 3>both huge fans of an American in London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a biggie.</v>

2428
01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.510
<v Speaker 3>That's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That right there.</v>

2429
01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:02.380
<v Speaker 3>He was on the podcast a few years back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2430
01:58:02.381 --> 01:58:07.381
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found the American Werewolf in London </v>

2431
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:07.381
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a cop,</v>

2432
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:07.381
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

2433
01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a replica of the thing that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie and Pat sells it.</v>

2434
01:58:10.981 --> 01:58:13.770
<v Speaker 3>You can order it online and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2435
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 3>he builds it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the real exact scales,</v>

2436
01:58:18.121 --> 01:58:20.880
<v Speaker 3>like one and a half times the size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real werewolf,</v>

2437
01:58:20.881 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 3>the Werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a smaller.</v>

2438
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 3>My werewolves bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just texted when we got here today,</v>

2439
01:58:25.861 --> 01:58:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I texted a picture that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to Chile and he goes,</v>

2440
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a,</v>

2441
01:58:30.961 --> 01:58:31.530
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2442
01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:33.060
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's this for Halloween?</v>

2443
01:58:33.061 --> 01:58:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand 18 for is haunted Yardi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't Bisbee,</v>

2444
01:58:36.601 --> 01:58:39.090
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a Patrick Mcgee.</v>

2445
01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.350
<v Speaker 3>He's done work for my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2446
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you called</v>

2447
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>that and Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking amazing.</v>

2448
01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:47.500
<v Speaker 2>He nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had to correct myself.</v>

2449
01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I said it's a one and a half times </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger.</v>

2450
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more like 40 percent larger</v>

2451
01:58:52.061 --> 01:58:53.290
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that I think about it,</v>

2452
01:58:53.291 --> 01:58:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm confusing it with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

2453
01:58:55.420 --> 01:59:00.420
<v Speaker 2>but the the copy that he makes is </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely larger so he could work on </v>

2454
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:03.960
<v Speaker 2>the finer details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like blood on the teeth and the </v>

2455
01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.411
<v Speaker 2>hairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all yak hair around the head and </v>

2456
01:59:07.411 --> 01:59:07.411
<v Speaker 2>it's all synthetic shit in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2457
01:59:07.411 --> 01:59:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that's his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at like the blood around</v>

2458
01:59:09.911 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 2>the teeth do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

2459
01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:12.520
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking amazing.</v>

2460
01:59:12.521 --> 01:59:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I get great pleasure every time I come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and I look at that Werewolf.</v>

2461
01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2462
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I love looking at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that I'm a fucking grown</v>

2463
01:59:24.281 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 2>up</v>

2464
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 4>be used for anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smile all the time.</v>

2465
01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2466
01:59:29.391 --> 01:59:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Well you were showing us some shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just smiled like,</v>

2467
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:34.800
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so fucking rare smile.</v>

2468
01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:36.550
<v Speaker 4>You used to be a lot angrier.</v>

2469
01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got out of that.</v>

2470
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:41.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what it's like we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about before.</v>

2471
01:59:41.271 --> 01:59:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you use in your energy on?</v>

2472
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Are you using your energy on being upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>at things and being in this constant </v>

2473
01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.351
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a momentum of being upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the past that you never stop or do </v>

2474
01:59:54.111 --> 01:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you figure out a way to like hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brakes?</v>

2475
01:59:56.150 --> 01:59:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2476
01:59:57.710 --> 01:59:59.850
<v Speaker 2>why are we angry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we getting upset?</v>

2477
01:59:59.930 --> 02:00:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just take all that cave man</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit and just go smash some punching bag</v>

2478
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:07.820
<v Speaker 2>and then come back to reality and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like really relaxed about it,</v>

2479
02:00:07.821 --> 02:00:12.821
<v Speaker 2>but do it purposely like have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of intent behind it to eliminate the </v>

2480
02:00:12.821 --> 02:00:15.710
<v Speaker 2>demons and I figured out how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere along the line.</v>

2481
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Aging helps a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not</v>

2482
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.420
<v Speaker 2>just that it's not aging as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>decay,</v>

2483
02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>it's aging as far as information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2484
02:00:24.710 --> 02:00:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking about like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

2485
02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.970
<v Speaker 2>If people figure out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans live to be like 900 years old,</v>

2486
02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.470
<v Speaker 2>would it be fucked up if you had sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>with 50 year old people like you fucking</v>

2487
02:00:35.471 --> 02:00:37.330
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even know any better.</v>

2488
02:00:37.331 --> 02:00:39.910
<v Speaker 2>It's only 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's basically a baby.</v>

2489
02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Did you treat him like that until </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're 50 and say you're not an adult.</v>

2490
02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2491
02:00:45.211 --> 02:00:48.000
<v Speaker 4>You're 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have a baby right now.</v>

2492
02:00:48.001 --> 02:00:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Nature has said you are ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually procreate,</v>

2493
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:55.200
<v Speaker 4>but we've legislated that you can't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>an adult until you're 18,</v>

2494
02:00:55.470 --> 02:01:00.030
<v Speaker 4>so for the next six years we're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to treat you like a baby.</v>

2495
02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:04.470
<v Speaker 2>That's an unnecessary burden for the boy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the girl and the lack of</v>

2496
02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:06.760
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2497
02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:11.780
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're telling them every feeling that </v>

2498
02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.030
<v Speaker 4>you have naturally is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to explain that to you,</v>

2499
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:19.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we want to give you a good </v>

2500
02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.731
<v Speaker 4>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't have to deal with all </v>

2501
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:21.731
<v Speaker 4>these adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2502
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:25.780
<v Speaker 4>that's what their body's telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you better be honest or all of a </v>

2503
02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:28.730
<v Speaker 4>sudden your kids fucking a 38 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>producer.</v>

2504
02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also</v>

2505
02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:34.740
<v Speaker 2>problem with like looking at children as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being different than a person and it's </v>

2506
02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:34.740
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2507
02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:35.920
<v Speaker 2>this is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made them.</v>

2508
02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You are not going to like boys Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2509
02:01:39.610 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you're going</v>

2510
02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:45.020
<v Speaker 3>to like girls because you're a boy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to carry on the Harris' </v>

2511
02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:45.100
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2512
02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have a kid just for the longterm</v>

2513
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 3>practical joke of raising him gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian,</v>

2514
02:01:56.451 --> 02:02:01.451
<v Speaker 3>Youtube and say I was just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who just had a kid and know he's trying </v>

2515
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 3>to pitch them this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brendan,</v>

2516
02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Walsh like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go and just act like you're raising</v>

2517
02:02:10.701 --> 02:02:14.840
<v Speaker 3>your kid gay and you know when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>older to men,</v>

2518
02:02:14.841 --> 02:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>meet each other and just say this to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

2519
02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I think you could easily in this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna sound fucked up.</v>

2520
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you can easily convince a young </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid that like,</v>

2521
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:30.350
<v Speaker 3>sex with males is normal if everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

2522
02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:30.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2523
02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 3>The idea was you have to still sex shame</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kid.</v>

2524
02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It's only okay to be gay once you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>married,</v>

2525
02:02:39.171 --> 02:02:41.870
<v Speaker 3>after you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're gay,</v>

2526
02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:45.010
<v Speaker 3>so these are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're married to a girl or a guy.</v>

2527
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:47.300
<v Speaker 3>The end game is the kid has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>

2528
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:52.301
<v Speaker 3>when he's 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out as straight to his parents and </v>

2529
02:02:52.301 --> 02:02:56.500
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have really progressive parents </v>

2530
02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:56.500
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you think you can be straight but </v>

2533

<v Speaker 3>trends you think you're willing to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2534
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.900
<v Speaker 3>They'll sit down at the table of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressive Brownie points.</v>

<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>

2536
02:03:08.751 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Michael and you being straight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>

2537
02:03:11.931 --> 02:03:15.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a big bummer to our social system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're going to think,</v>

2538
02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:17.960
<v Speaker 3>here's what we're going to work at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law firm,</v>

2539
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:23.080
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna think we shamed you out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being gay and that's simply not the </v>

2540
02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have.</v>

2541
02:03:25.701 --> 02:03:30.701
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy gel where we can sit here </v>
<v Speaker 3>with white privilege.</v>

2542
02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>

2543
02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:34.550
<v Speaker 3>We're not like Sam Cedar Comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Privilege,</v>

2544
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:39.551
<v Speaker 3>which we have in droves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is way more way better diamond </v>

2545
02:03:40.221 --> 02:03:44.150
<v Speaker 3>elite status than just white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have comedy privilege.</v>

2546
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just kidding.</v>

2547
02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:46.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

2548
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 3>but it says comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2549
02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:51.260
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to get comfy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just kidding.</v>

2550
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:53.070
<v Speaker 3>And then it's all golden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2551
02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:58.110
<v Speaker 3>years clearly kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not saying it's </v>

2552
02:03:58.110 --> 02:03:58.820
<v Speaker 3>specifically in a form where they trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to disseminate information.</v>

2553
02:03:59.090 --> 02:04:04.090
<v Speaker 3>He try to be funny as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll say extreme things that don't </v>

2554
02:04:04.090 --> 02:04:06.410
<v Speaker 3>necessarily represent your actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint just because you want it to be</v>

2555
02:04:06.411 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 3>more hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Sam Cedar were funny all the time,</v>

2556
02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.530
<v Speaker 3>rather than that one tweet who'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2557
02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brightmore.</v>

2558
02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:18.490

<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2559
02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:23.590
<v Speaker 3>But we have the luxury of having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>social circle that is very tolerant to </v>

2560
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:29.660
<v Speaker 3>the n word degree tolerant in a green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

2561
02:04:29.690 --> 02:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>You can't say nigger word degree.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2563
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:39.220
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a gratuitous use of the </v>

2564
02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:39.220
<v Speaker 3>N.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2568
02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 3>you get super upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone says,</v>

02:04:52.501 --> 02:04:57.501
<v Speaker 3>you're a cunt to a feminist comedian in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the confines of a Green Room.</v>

2573
02:04:59.130 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's free and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It leaves the green rooms.</v>

2574
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I've been part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has a problem with Yukon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I mean even in America if you will,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2584
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.660
<v Speaker 3>owns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all talking.</v>

2585
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:26.220
<v Speaker 3>We're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Saddam Hussein was a cunt.</v>

2586
02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:31.980
<v Speaker 3>His kid would cons his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard there were cuts those sons.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say that the two.</v>

2588
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.440

<v Speaker 3>He might've had other sons.</v>

2589
02:05:37.441 --> 02:05:42.441
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're kind of shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were two cousins who was one of </v>

<v Speaker 3>where they were getting married.</v>

2592
02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They would take the broad raper and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would feed her two dogs.</v>

2593
02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:57.200

<v Speaker 3>That's another thing about aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not giving a fuck,</v>

2598
02:06:06.451 --> 02:06:10.680
<v Speaker 3>but also giving more of a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were kids were the same age.</v>

2599

<v Speaker 3>We would watch all that faces a death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't get enough of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he cracked that.</v>

2605
02:06:25.651 --> 02:06:27.510

<v Speaker 3>Never going to drink it.</v>

2606
02:06:28.770 --> 02:06:30.150
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes my dick hard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>she used to like get a diet coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going through a drive through diet</v>

2609
02:06:38.311 --> 02:06:43.311
<v Speaker 3>coke and they pressed the little thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the top of the to show you which </v>

2610

<v Speaker 3>drink that for the aftertaste.</v>

2614

<v Speaker 3>Never leaves your fucking mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you just try this for me.</v>

2617
02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:10.220
<v Speaker 3>If you're thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetic and you pull up to the Wendy's </v>

2618

<v Speaker 3>drive through at 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you like extra large diet coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2624
02:07:26.641 --> 02:07:31.641
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like in restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't bring anything other than </v>

2643
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:19.630
<v Speaker 3>said to all my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2644
02:08:19.631 --> 02:08:24.631
<v Speaker 3>I admire the fact that you push through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and even though you were like a </v>

2645
02:08:24.631 --> 02:08:26.290
<v Speaker 3>little bit like flustered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were still gregarious.</v>

2646
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I can't watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you were in a weird place.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She might not make it.</v>

2651
02:08:44.411 --> 02:08:49.411
<v Speaker 3>If she does make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be worst than not making it at </v>

2652
02:08:49.411 --> 02:08:49.600
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He has no discretion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just getting any woman and forcing </v>

2732
02:12:34.701 --> 02:12:37.550
<v Speaker 4>her onstage and you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2733
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Why isn't I know that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2734
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:40.730
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know.</v>

2735
02:12:41.150 --> 02:12:43.250
<v Speaker 4>You were saying why she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2736
02:12:43.251 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably my fault.</v>

2737
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why your manager saying we need women.</v>

2738
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:49.640
<v Speaker 4>While that's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably said it,</v>

2739
02:12:49.641 --> 02:12:50.060
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2740
02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:55.620
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people that you had on that </v>

2741
02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>day is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stage,</v>

2742
02:12:56.350 --> 02:13:00.700
<v Speaker 2>whether it's bill burr or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer or doug or me.</v>

2743
02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey showed up at his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the weirdest thing was that was</v>

2744
02:13:04.901 --> 02:13:09.901
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came on stage with a little kid and </v>

2745
02:13:09.901 --> 02:13:09.901
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2746
02:13:09.901 --> 02:13:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally can't do this legally,</v>

2747
02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:14.200
<v Speaker 2>like legally can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it's okay to do this.</v>

2748
02:13:14.201 --> 02:13:19.201
<v Speaker 2>We can't talk about the same things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going to talk in front of your </v>

2749
02:13:19.201 --> 02:13:22.141
<v Speaker 2>kick and create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have your kid on stage and </v>

2750
02:13:22.141 --> 02:13:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Doug wants to talk about anal vibrators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like it's the hardest he's ever come</v>

2751
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:26.070
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2752
02:13:26.250 --> 02:13:29.890
<v Speaker 2>the Gal was drowning and gagging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it felt so good.</v>

2753
02:13:29.891 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take before</v>

2754
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:34.920
<v Speaker 3>you can resuscitate someone with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain damage?</v>

2755
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Like what if she blacks out from all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments coming out because there's this</v>

2756
02:13:39.570 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 3>vibrator back in front of his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

2757
02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Let me get the point and let's go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this please,</v>

2758
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:48.550
<v Speaker 3>because Olivia grace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she was down in Brisbane,</v>

2759
02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:53.900
<v Speaker 3>she said she was there that night when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Hennigan was scouring the audience</v>

2760
02:13:54.091 --> 02:13:56.570
<v Speaker 3>for female comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's lost.</v>

2761
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:59.580
<v Speaker 3>She's very boyish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has a very short haircut.</v>

2762
02:13:59.581 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 3>She's very boyish and he say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>

2764
02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:06.150

2769
02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.980

<v Speaker 3>You're fired anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I take credit.</v>

2791
02:15:50.361 --> 02:15:52.560

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2792
02:15:52.690 --> 02:15:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Say it's my fault.</v>

02:15:54.171 --> 02:15:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't talk to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>beforehand.</v>

2794
02:15:56.180 --> 02:16:01.180
<v Speaker 3>There was no option to talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>security guards and said don't let </v>

2795
02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.660
<v Speaker 3>anybody back here and no one gets on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage unless doug and I say yes.</v>

2796

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2797
02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Only from hearing secondhand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I was there,</v>

2798
02:16:08.931 --> 02:16:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I knew there was whatever that girl was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a Santana.</v>

2799
02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Morgan Murphy was already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

2800
02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:18.980
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't look down on like Sarah Tiana</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2801
02:16:18.981 --> 02:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there when the issue happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she apparently had some issue and it</v>

2802
02:16:22.761 --> 02:16:24.140
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a non.</v>

2803
02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all not a humorous discussion.</v>

2804
02:16:28.070 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 3>It was like a sincere know how bad it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that Donald Trump was going to win </v>

2805
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:37.141
<v Speaker 3>and how bad it was for women because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was right after the grab them by the </v>

2806
02:16:37.141 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Pussy video or audio.</v>

2807
02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 3>So there was a lot of shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2808
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd gone to the other room.</v>

2809
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I did a set in the or and I came back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's like,</v>

2810
02:16:45.281 --> 02:16:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you missed his crazy blowout.</v>

2811
02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.840
<v Speaker 3>But she and Bill Burr and Sarah Tiana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my point is that is not a </v>

2812
02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:56.550
<v Speaker 3>negative or a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's huge blown up conflict and </v>

2813
02:16:56.821 --> 02:17:01.821
<v Speaker 3>the broadcast people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually that's not what we planned.</v>

2814
02:17:02.050 --> 02:17:07.050
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will click on it because they </v>

2815
02:17:07.050 --> 02:17:09.451
<v Speaker 3>heard at some point there is a big blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>out as long as we can keep Sarah Tiana </v>

2816
02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:14.581
<v Speaker 3>off twitter for a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't know or I don't want </v>

2817
02:17:14.581 --> 02:17:19.291
<v Speaker 3>this to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean reading the people that had </v>

2818
02:17:19.291 --> 02:17:21.811
<v Speaker 3>commented on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of the people were like </v>

2819
02:17:21.811 --> 02:17:21.811
<v Speaker 3>particularly fucking mean when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>commented on it.</v>

02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Someone in the other day online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed a picture of me and Dave attell</v>

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:39.790
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy.</v>

2849
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:48.160
<v Speaker 3>but I can't talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was wonderful.</v>

2854
02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:01.540
<v Speaker 3>It was a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to be an audience member.</v>

2855
02:19:01.570 --> 02:19:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing with somebody out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2856
02:19:03.851 --> 02:19:05.110
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2858
02:19:06.251 --> 02:19:09.310
<v Speaker 3>That guy was sitting next to me in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>room that night,</v>

2859
02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:10.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

2860
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:16.200
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was only like that might've been </v>

2861
02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:17.260
<v Speaker 3>60 people in that room and tell was </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying.</v>

2862
02:19:17.470 --> 02:19:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean destroying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2863
02:19:19.001 --> 02:19:21.550
<v Speaker 3>you can't say fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch that.</v>

2864
02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:24.210
<v Speaker 3>It was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2865
02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:28.090
<v Speaker 3>It isn't often the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I handled the steps</v>

2866
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:33.190
<v Speaker 4>with Doug's audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you hate headphones that are hurting </v>

2867
02:19:33.351 --> 02:19:37.880
<v Speaker 4>my fucking ears?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gets can swap out fucking sweat.</v>

2868
02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Is it the case that there's somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's like,</v>

2869
02:19:42.441 --> 02:19:47.441
<v Speaker 4>one of Doug's fans who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm helping Joe by saying get rid of </v>

2870
02:19:47.441 --> 02:19:50.340
<v Speaker 4>that guy because I just want to hear a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few gaps.</v>

2871
02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 4>The problem with the last comic standing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is people go,</v>

2872
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:56.210
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a way better than so and so.</v>

2873
02:19:56.211 --> 02:19:59.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and should they do that in your face?</v>

2874
02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:05.200
<v Speaker 4>But they'll do it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll walk right up to you and go so </v>

2875
02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 4>much funnier than that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that you brought out of your own</v>

2876
02:20:07.671 --> 02:20:12.671
<v Speaker 4>pocket because you thought that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be known to your audience.</v>

2877
02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:16.880
<v Speaker 4>They act like this opening act was </v>
<v Speaker 4>forced upon,</v>

2878
02:20:16.881 --> 02:20:21.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought him out of my own pocket </v>

2879
02:20:21.881 --> 02:20:24.221
<v Speaker 4>because I thought you would enjoy him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he needs to be seen and you're </v>

2880
02:20:24.411 --> 02:20:25.100
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>

2881
02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I like that you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do that.</v>

2882
02:20:26.961 --> 02:20:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Like I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's super important.</v>

2883
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring guys like Brendan Walsh out on the</v>

2884
02:20:31.671 --> 02:20:35.300
<v Speaker 4>road and all these dudes you bring out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and tell people about them.</v>

2885
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:40.930
<v Speaker 4>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big part about this era as </v>

2886
02:20:40.930 --> 02:20:41.960
<v Speaker 4>opposed to the old arrows is that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think this era is more supportive.</v>

2887
02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:44.480
<v Speaker 4>There's more opportunities so people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feel famine,</v>

2888
02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:45.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feel like,</v>

2889
02:20:45.681 --> 02:20:50.681
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we one guard can be the host of the </v>

2890
02:20:50.681 --> 02:20:50.681
<v Speaker 4>tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not a thing anymore.</v>

2891
02:20:50.890 --> 02:20:52.490
<v Speaker 4>Like if somebody offered me the tonight </v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

2892
02:20:52.491 --> 02:20:55.100

<v Speaker 4>shit I don't want to talk about for like</v>

<v Speaker 4>more money?</v>

2896
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 4>We didn't have Ferguson last night.</v>

2897
02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the line is a segment where the </v>

2898

<v Speaker 4>riots took place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Craig Ferguson.</v>

2900
02:21:09.921 --> 02:21:13.010

<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2902
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:19.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't watch late night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I was flipping channels and I saw</v>

2903
02:21:19.851 --> 02:21:24.420
<v Speaker 4>you for a minute with your accent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting your face into that like Fisheye</v>

2904
02:21:24.470 --> 02:21:29.470
<v Speaker 4>lens thing he would do in his monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like you until I heard you on </v>

<v Speaker 4>human being for an hour and 20 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's a guy with good stories and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>hated.</v>

2907
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:42.710
<v Speaker 4>He is like no one would accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he did not want to do anything </v>

2908
02:21:43.311 --> 02:21:45.140
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're offering them other projects.</v>

2909

<v Speaker 4>That's the greatest thing about his </v>

2915
02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:54.720
<v Speaker 4>decision making.</v>

2916

<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to do it by their rules</v>

2920
02:22:03.441 --> 02:22:08.441
<v Speaker 4>and no one believes when you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Kinda half the through line of the </v>

2921

<v Speaker 4>book is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do what I do,</v>

2922
02:22:11.961 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 4>but no one buys that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to be more famous.</v>

2923
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:18.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2924
02:22:18.421 --> 02:22:23.421

<v Speaker 4>I did to plant little of eggplant and I </v>

2925
02:22:24.051 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 4>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I don't want more</v>

02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:33.780
<v Speaker 2>With stevie on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking eggplant Parmesan.</v>

2928
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:39.140
<v Speaker 2>One time my mother tried to make it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so grotesque that when she's </v>

2929
02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:40.680
<v Speaker 2>saying you got to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when she tried it,</v>

2930
02:22:40.681 --> 02:22:41.250
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2931
02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me all your plates.</v>

2932
02:22:43.081 --> 02:22:44.980
<v Speaker 2>This came out bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2933
02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you went to Trenton yonkers or </v>

2934
02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:51.360
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like a little bit of fame,</v>

2935
02:22:51.540 --> 02:22:54.750
<v Speaker 2>you know you're not going to like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like.</v>

2936
02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you like a little bit.</v>

2937
02:22:56.730 --> 02:23:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's be a little bit and I think a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit is good.</v>

2938
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all good as long as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers and manageable and you can stay </v>

2939
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:06.360
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problems when you go.</v>

2940
02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the best example,</v>

2941
02:23:08.850 --> 02:23:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson who has never been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better example in the world of toxicity </v>

2942
02:23:13.850 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 2>due to celebrity status.</v>

2943
02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you hit critical levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hit some three mile island shit.</v>

2944
02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:24.740
<v Speaker 2>You hit some Chernobyl shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to maintain the amount </v>

2945
02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 2>of energy that's coming your way as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal human being.</v>

2946
02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any unique DNA that </v>

2947
02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:34.371
<v Speaker 2>allows you to deal with the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 million people know who you are or </v>

2948
02:23:34.371 --> 02:23:39.321
<v Speaker 2>more Jackson Swath of your clothing Dna </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and put it in a petri dish and make </v>

2949
02:23:41.401 --> 02:23:46.401
<v Speaker 2>a fucking cloning it and frame it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in their man cave and there's a </v>

2950
02:23:46.401 --> 02:23:50.631
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people to think that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're molesting kids and you've got to </v>

2951
02:23:50.631 --> 02:23:53.071
<v Speaker 2>fucking amusement park in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're literally losing your mind </v>

2952
02:23:53.071 --> 02:23:53.071
<v Speaker 2>and you tell a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2953
02:23:53.071 --> 02:23:57.591
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to analysts anesthetize me </v>

2954
02:23:57.591 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 2>every night in a fucking tube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just put,</v>

2955
02:23:58.850 --> 02:24:02.940
<v Speaker 2>put me in some fucking crazy hyperbaric </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamber and pumping the gas.</v>

2956
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was off the fucking </v>

2957
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There had never been anybody that famous</v>

2958
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was literally the guy with the candle</v>

2959
02:24:11.761 --> 02:24:14.760
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the universe going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2960
02:24:14.761 --> 02:24:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep.</v>

2961
02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.110
<v Speaker 2>See there's more room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one's ever been here before.</v>

2962
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:21.120
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever been that famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

2963
02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:25.260
<v Speaker 2>He went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went completely insane and died young</v>

2964
02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:30.060
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nowhere between 1990 and 2017.</v>

2965
02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Does it look like any of what's happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him is manageable?</v>

2966
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's running down a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tumbling down a hill and he's okay </v>

2967
02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:39.750
<v Speaker 2>for the first decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the first two decades.</v>

2968
02:24:39.970 --> 02:24:43.200
<v Speaker 2>After awhile he's just getting chewed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck up psychologically.</v>

2969
02:24:43.201 --> 02:24:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Physically he keeps getting more plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

2970
02:24:46.470 --> 02:24:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was ever very stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychologic.</v>

2971
02:24:50.691 --> 02:24:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>

2972
02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2973
02:24:52.951 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 2>but if you ever seen that document </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them,</v>

2974
02:24:54.901 --> 02:24:56.480
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking love.</v>

2975
02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.610
<v Speaker 2>That documentary is the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

2976
02:24:59.790 --> 02:25:00.540
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2977
02:25:00.541 --> 02:25:02.220
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earlier again,</v>

2978
02:25:02.221 --> 02:25:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music to watch that you go,</v>

2979
02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:10.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy really didn't know what the </v>

<v Speaker 2>I just don't get it.</v>

2981
02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:12.510
<v Speaker 2>He was really brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think the songs suck.</v>

2982
02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Well they suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like what you want to </v>

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2984
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:19.740

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2985
02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were.</v>

2994
02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.400

<v Speaker 2>It wasn't mark Parenteau who's like the </v>

2995
02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.300
<v Speaker 2>big ones in the morning,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He played Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played a Michael Jackson Song.</v>

2997
02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was beat it and he said,</v>

02:25:55.391 --> 02:25:56.560
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he played Billie Jean.</v>

3000
02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:03.120
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this isn't rock and roll because </v>

3001
02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:03.120
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to play.</v>

3002
02:26:03.130 --> 02:26:08.130
<v Speaker 2>And he played it and he played billy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jean and I remember it was no twitter </v>

3003
02:26:08.130 --> 02:26:09.280
<v Speaker 2>back their book and with this anchor </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

3004
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a real dj.</v>

3005
02:26:12.191 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 2>He was like one of the last of the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>djs.</v>

3006
02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:16.480
<v Speaker 2>They could literally decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3007
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I just heard this man Jack Umay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3008
02:26:18.971 --> 02:26:23.971
<v Speaker 2>this Lou Reed record that you fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to hear from the beginning to the </v>

3009
02:26:23.971 --> 02:26:27.961
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to listen from the beginning </v>

3010
02:26:27.961 --> 02:26:27.961
<v Speaker 2>to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to play this.</v>

3011
02:26:27.961 --> 02:26:32.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear Bruce springsteen when he was </v>

3012
02:26:32.130 --> 02:26:32.130
<v Speaker 2>like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3013
02:26:32.130 --> 02:26:34.240
<v Speaker 2>like beginning to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3014
02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:39.660
<v Speaker 2>those days should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to sit there and listen and </v>

3015
02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:41.980
<v Speaker 2>you'd be he that doesn't exist anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and there's too many.</v>

3016
02:26:42.310 --> 02:26:44.500
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the problems with money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3017
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:49.501
<v Speaker 2>There's problems with trademarks and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to put things on youtube and </v>

3018
02:26:49.501 --> 02:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you can get credit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or put that up,</v>

3019
02:26:49.771 --> 02:26:54.771

<v Speaker 2>wanting to appear right now and pr and </v>

3020
02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 2>do like that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably be almost impossible.</v>

3021
02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Like how many radio stations are there </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world where they would let you </v>

3022
02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:05.641
<v Speaker 2>just play a whole brief bruce </v>
<v Speaker 2>springsteen album from the beginning to </v>

3023
02:27:05.641 --> 02:27:06.400
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrestrial radio at this point</v>

3024
02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:11.720
<v Speaker 4>probably play child porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just soundtracks and no one's listening </v>

3025

3071
02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:26.810
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know to joke around with.</v>

3072
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to bail a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before the coma.</v>

3073
02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3074

3081
02:29:54.621 --> 02:29:59.621

<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Denzel Washington where he </v>

3083

<v Speaker 4>and at the end he's drunk as shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>John Goodman,</v>

<v Speaker 4>with cocaine so he can testify it's the </v>

3088
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:25.270
<v Speaker 4>best ending of a movie or that movie.</v>

<v Speaker 4>cocaine and each problem,</v>

3101
02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:20.220

<v Speaker 2>That you shut off your phone like a </v>

3138
02:33:03.451 --> 02:33:03.451
<v Speaker 2>gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

3139
02:33:03.451 --> 02:33:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that your phone makes us</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting noise from 2006.</v>

3140
02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:13.200
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them sound and Samson used to </v>

3141
02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:15.310
<v Speaker 2>bust my balls because I was the last guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a flip phone.</v>

3142
02:33:15.311 --> 02:33:20.311
<v Speaker 2>So depressing and you'd have all the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadgetry and I was so proud to have a </v>

3143
02:33:20.311 --> 02:33:22.930
<v Speaker 2>flip phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we started working in the UK,</v>

3144
02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:28.090
<v Speaker 2>nobody calls everyone only texts because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess phone calls,</v>

3145
02:33:28.091 --> 02:33:31.120
<v Speaker 2>cost of fucking thousand pounds a minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

3146
02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 2>So I had to actually get a smart phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still long for the flip phone days</v>

3147
02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:39.850
<v Speaker 2>will samsung just came out with a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone that's a hybrid.</v>

3148
02:33:39.850 --> 02:33:44.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of a smartphone and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>flip phone and you open it up and you </v>

3149
02:33:44.850 --> 02:33:48.640
<v Speaker 2>can get an actual keyboard and he talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people just like a regular flip phone</v>

3150
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:53.290
<v Speaker 2>and when you're done you hang it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the front of the phone is a Bezel.</v>

3151
02:33:53.291 --> 02:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Lists smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the front of the phone?</v>

3152
02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could do text messages,</v>

3153
02:33:57.821 --> 02:34:02.821
<v Speaker 2>you can view the Internet and then when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to open it up and make phone </v>

3154
02:34:02.821 --> 02:34:04.840
<v Speaker 2>calls that acts like a regular old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school flip phone and people really like</v>

3155
02:34:04.841 --> 02:34:09.841
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of like pressing physical </v>

3156
02:34:09.841 --> 02:34:09.841
<v Speaker 2>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3157
02:34:09.841 --> 02:34:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen you watch a movie on your </v>

3158
02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:13.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have a busy,</v>

3159
02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:18.721
<v Speaker 2>they don't have cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why football is popular at my </v>

3160
02:34:18.721 --> 02:34:18.721
<v Speaker 2>house because no one has</v>

3161
02:34:18.721 --> 02:34:21.760
<v Speaker 3>tv so they can't watch it unless they </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to my house.</v>

3162
02:34:21.970 --> 02:34:26.970
<v Speaker 3>But I know people that watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just sit and watch an entire </v>

3163
02:34:26.970 --> 02:34:27.280
<v Speaker 3>movie on a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3164
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't watch it on a 32 inch screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

3165
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:33.340
<v Speaker 3>I need a big fucking screen and watch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

3166
02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 100 percent.</v>

3167
02:34:34.601 --> 02:34:36.490
<v Speaker 3>And I go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only time that there's that phone,</v>

3168
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 3>the only time is when you're on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>

3169
02:34:38.741 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 3>you're trapped and all you have is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

3170
02:34:40.031 --> 02:34:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Look at that phone doug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that screen.</v>

3171
02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.530
<v Speaker 3>So the front of it is 60 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will be an awkward phone call.</v>

3172
02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:50.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't carry that around Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even understand inches,</v>

3173
02:34:50.651 --> 02:34:55.651

<v Speaker 3>I was going to tweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let's wait.</v>

3203
02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:06.130
<v Speaker 3>I've got somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Silverman.</v>

3204
02:36:06.330 --> 02:36:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Silverman is a friend and a </v>

3205
02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:13.111
<v Speaker 3>wonderful comedian and a colleague and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think you and I both respect her as I </v>

3206
02:36:13.111 --> 02:36:17.580
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's what I didn't want </v>

3207
02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:17.580
<v Speaker 3>her to get into any trouble because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a,</v>

3208
02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:19.030
<v Speaker 3>is it okay to love Louis ck thing?</v>

3209
02:36:19.410 --> 02:36:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay to love?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's me with my dick out.</v>

3210
02:36:22.570 --> 02:36:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not be anymore.</v>

3211
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:27.550
<v Speaker 3>This is why we need to burn that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to burn your whole phone.</v>

3212
02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You need to get modern phone that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to take photos and get online and </v>

3213
02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:34.790
<v Speaker 3>then you need to burn that thing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

3214
02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Can't have those pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have those pictures floating </v>

3215
02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:40.030
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important,</v>

3216
02:36:40.031 --> 02:36:41.200
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3217
02:36:41.201 --> 02:36:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I was the guy that put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad.</v>

3218
02:36:44.170 --> 02:36:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Those are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are developed pictures from a </v>

3219
02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:49.170
<v Speaker 3>photo mat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's gonna take a little time,</v>

3220
02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:53.821
<v Speaker 3>but once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we get through this we're going to </v>

3221
02:36:53.821 --> 02:36:55.711
<v Speaker 3>find some sort of a reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a agreement where when you can and </v>

3222
02:36:55.711 --> 02:37:00.091
<v Speaker 3>cannot pull your dick out because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we needed to do when people are young </v>

3223
02:37:00.091 --> 02:37:02.710
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls install a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

3224
02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:07.600
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a sexual equivalent to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey tester or something like a,</v>

3225
02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:08.890
<v Speaker 3>like a green light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3226
02:37:08.891 --> 02:37:11.140
<v Speaker 3>like acting like goes off like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3227
02:37:11.141 --> 02:37:14.860
<v Speaker 3>you can pull your dick out now sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm 23 years old,</v>

3228
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I'd be going to college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that sex would pull your dick out.</v>

3229
02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.530
<v Speaker 3>It's when you're our age that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate.</v>

3230
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Unless they're our age two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you know what,</v>

3231
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 3>there's no 50 year old comics hitting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 year old women,</v>

3232
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:34.630
<v Speaker 3>which is a maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like what if it's a woman like </v>

3233
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Christie Brinkley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like 63.</v>

3234
02:37:35.481 --> 02:37:37.670
<v Speaker 3>She's still hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you go,</v>

3235
02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:40.310
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm your age so I know who you are.</v>

3236
02:37:40.311 --> 02:37:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Unlike young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just happy to be there.</v>

3237
02:37:43.191 --> 02:37:48.191
<v Speaker 3>You don't pull your dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I did this years ago when it was </v>

3238
02:37:48.191 --> 02:37:52.001
<v Speaker 3>erect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people would be mad if a woman </v>

3239
02:37:52.001 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 3>pulled her vagina out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost zero.</v>

3240
02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who would feel threatened?</v>

3241
02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:59.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is the physical </v>

3242
02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:00.050
<v Speaker 3>violence potential and the number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have been raped.</v>

3243
02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:02.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just about weird sex.</v>

3244
02:38:02.901 --> 02:38:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3245
02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:09.251
<v Speaker 3>this is an which is the bit that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been working on is the difference </v>

3246
02:38:09.251 --> 02:38:11.600
<v Speaker 3>between hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it or leave it.</v>

3247
02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

3248
02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Christie Brinkley does not live a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in perfect lighting with perfect </v>

3249
02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.130
<v Speaker 3>makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need the dark ones with no.</v>

3250
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:29.390
<v Speaker 3>At some point she's hunched over like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>am with this posture,</v>

3251
02:38:29.391 --> 02:38:31.850
<v Speaker 3>wearing reading glasses thicker than </v>
<v Speaker 3>ours.</v>

3252
02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Trying to focus on something on a laptop</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that spill bellies hanging over cunt</v>

3253
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:43.150
<v Speaker 3>because eight kids came out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you both put on mascot masks</v>

3254
02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:48.220
<v Speaker 3>like you are the squirrel and she's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>raccoon and you guys just fucked by the </v>

3255
02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 3>firelight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get right in front of that God damn</v>

3256
02:38:50.451 --> 02:38:55.451
<v Speaker 3>fireplace and go to town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>molly and overrated because it leads to </v>

3257
02:38:57.081 --> 02:38:59.780
<v Speaker 3>all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly can.</v>

3258
02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.840
<v Speaker 3>It certainly can lead to a like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>unofficial bond with people,</v>

3259
02:39:05.390 --> 02:39:08.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if everybody.</v>

3260
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3261
02:39:10.270 --> 02:39:14.810
<v Speaker 3>if like hugging people if like </v>
<v Speaker 3>committing to hugging people was like as</v>

3262
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:17.240
<v Speaker 3>intimate as community to having sex with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3263
02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Well hugging people is really quick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one says,</v>

3264
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:24.080
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hugged too soon.</v>

3265
02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:25.590
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

3266
02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping it was going to be a long </v>

3267
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:32.741
<v Speaker 3>hug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his hug was done like in seconds </v>

3268
02:39:32.741 --> 02:39:34.100
<v Speaker 3>like he was a teenager and his first </v>
<v Speaker 3>hug,</v>

3269
02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:39.370
<v Speaker 3>like the man does not have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pull out of the hug before the woman </v>

3270
02:39:39.890 --> 02:39:42.920
<v Speaker 3>wants to end the hug like the period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know this.</v>

3271
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Can you hug twice in a night?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3272
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:46.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

3273
02:39:46.191 --> 02:39:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Because the second hug will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>unenthusiastic and not representative of</v>

3274
02:39:49.281 --> 02:39:52.130
<v Speaker 3>your soul who you are as a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

3275
02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:55.790
<v Speaker 3>You need to only hug fucking once a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

3276
02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Once asked someone you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Porn has changed the game.</v>

3277
02:39:59.030 --> 02:40:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Porn has ruined fucking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuing to ruin.</v>

3278
02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Fucking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just setting you up for robot.</v>

3279
02:40:07.581 --> 02:40:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Fuck dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that stripper?</v>

3280
02:40:09.450 --> 02:40:12.010
<v Speaker 3>A robot that gyrates on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the,</v>

3281
02:40:12.011 --> 02:40:13.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pole.</v>

3282
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:17.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a robot that goes on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stripper pole and it's clearly a robot.</v>

3283
02:40:17.701 --> 02:40:22.701
<v Speaker 3>You see all the mechanical parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's moving his ass like some </v>

3284
02:40:22.701 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 3>beautiful woman with a perfect ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You okay?</v>

3285
02:40:23.521 --> 02:40:28.521
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we are so close to not being able </v>

3286
02:40:28.521 --> 02:40:31.761
<v Speaker 3>to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if we understand what </v>

3287
02:40:31.761 --> 02:40:32.280
<v Speaker 3>exponential increases in technology are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3288
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Lead this robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's gyrating on this poll.</v>

3289
02:40:36.691 --> 02:40:38.400
<v Speaker 3>So she's holding this pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3290
02:40:38.490 --> 02:40:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Well right now you could see your joints</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff and I know she's done</v>

3291
02:40:41.371 --> 02:40:43.140
<v Speaker 3>a human even though she's wearing high </v>
<v Speaker 3>heeled shoes.</v>

3292
02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:45.660
<v Speaker 3>How many more years do we have before </v>
