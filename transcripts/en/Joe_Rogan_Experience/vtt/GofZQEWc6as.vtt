1
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.120
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.650
<v 0>Yes.</v>

3
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.560
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen,
my phone,
shit,
the bed officially.
Iphone six.
Don,</v>

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.590
I think I dropped it too many times or it got scared when it saw a John Wayne

5
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:28.200
par.
My phone decided to just give up what's happening man.
Man,

6
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.300
welcome back my friend.
It was a very fun working out with you today.

7
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:34.630
That was very enjoyable.
Uh,
John Wayne par for those you don't know,

8
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.130
multiple time.
Muy Thai champion.
Very famous in the world of combat sports,

9
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:44.131
both for your accomplishments and Muay Thai and a lot of people in the UFC know

10
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:46.420
about you for you or work with George Saint Pierre.

11
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.520
He did a lot of training with George,
uh,

12
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:53.320
for some of his MMA fights and God to show him some of your Moitai techniques,

13
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:54.560
which I really,
um,

14
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.810
learned a lot today watching you explain how you do things,

15
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.250
you have a very specific style that,
uh,
is very uniquely your own.
Yeah,

16
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:06.010
I was lucky enough to get it's highly and to leave it for four years.

17
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:10.060
So I took the tie concept and then uh,
I'll retire from Lillian,

18
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:13.360
told you and went to boxing for a year and then I just couldn't try it on my

19
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.430
hands and then not like boxing,

20
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.150
but then it sort of got a bit style cause like the crowds a little bit older and

21
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:20.650
the Molly tie crowd really pumps up.

22
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.340
So I decided to come back to my again and I sort of blended the two together

23
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.250
with the top half of the books in the bottom half of the morning toy.
And then,

24
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:31.390
uh,
just in sort of created my own concept.
And uh,
yeah,
it's been,

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.480
been very cool with been very successful with it seems like you also,

26
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.530
like we were talking today,

27
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:39.700
you incorporated a lot of the way Ramon Dekkers used to throw combinations.

28
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.200
Who was a Dutch guy who became probably one of the most famous ever foreigners

29
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.430
to fight in Thailand.

30
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:48.780
One most successful and the lower weight classes especially.
Yay.
He was a based,

31
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.960
um,
and then because he was the first white person to beat the tires,

32
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:54.010
he was such a role model.

33
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.630
And I one of the felonies footsteps still to this day I still trying to emulate

34
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.980
everything that he's done and uh,
just uh,
to the bay,

35
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.970
that guy that,
that winter Thailand and beat the ties at the range sport.
It's um,

36
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.640
yeah,
something that I look up to him even though he's passed,

37
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:12.260
I was still in me.

38
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.550
I still my hero in the world of [inaudible] in the world of fighting,
there's,

39
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:21.220
there's guys who have a gigantic names at like if you were thinking about a

40
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:22.360
sport like hockey,

41
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:27.220
it would be like a Wayne Gretzky or like a Bobby or that's where like Ramon

42
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
Dekkers was most casual people,

43
00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.640
casual fans or they're not aware of like some of the greats in this sport.

44
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:34.860
It's really unfortunate.

45
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.790
It's because America like kickboxing for whatever reason,

46
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.060
it never really caught on.

47
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:44.080
And Dana White has a really good theory and he thinks it's because that in like

48
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.380
the 1980s and then in 19,
like the early 19,

49
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.050
I guess it wasn't even the nineties like mostly the eighties,

50
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.440
they had that PKA kickboxing on TV,

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.100
which is where Rick Rufus came from,
who turned out to be a great fighter.

52
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.430
But a lot of those guys were sloppy boxers

53
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.360
<v 2>who had to throw a certain amount of kicks per round like you would do,</v>

54
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.280
would make you throw at six,
seven kicks per round.
I forget what the number was.

55
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.340
And so they would throw like these little flippy kicks with no power and then

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:14.080
they would just kind of sloppy box Benny Benny the jet and Peter Cunningham,
uh,

57
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.520
who else?
Peter Sugarfoot Cunningham,
he became successful outside of PKA.

58
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.950
He did Moy Thai.
He fought a lot of different styles.

59
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.780
He was a more complete fighter.

60
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.070
I think there was a lot of fights that they had on an ESPN at two o'clock in the

61
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.830
morning and watch these two white dudes kickbox and you're like,
what the fuck?

62
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.850
I watch.
And it just,

63
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.630
it just wasn't at the level that it's unfortunate that people,

64
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.660
some people still have that in their mind when it comes to kickboxing or to Thai

65
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.160
because in other countries like especially in Holland and uh,

66
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.550
you were one of the guys who carried it over to Australia at a very young age.

67
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.580
It's very popular over there like in Australia exports more showing the flights

68
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:59.071
at least once a week and then that one that was from 1996 and up until last year

69
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.350
and then they've just stopped showing the broadcast nail and nail.

70
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.520
UFC has flooded the market and uh,
there's no exposure for the key books anymore.

71
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.400
It's hard for us to shine.
Neal really because of the MMA.
Yay.
We'll UFC,

72
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:15.700
he's there doing the paper views and they're doing the roads to the UFC and the,

73
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.740
they're showing all the replace every time you put the Fox sports on this just

74
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.110
saturated the market and there's no real,
if I was a young fighter nail and a,

75
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.620
they say,
what would you want to do?
Do you want to keep books at him?
UFC,

76
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.790
UFC for sure.
Because look at the superstars,
whereas Moitai there's,

77
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.780
there's no,
there's no,
there's no,
um,
elite,

78
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.490
so of a place to go anymore.

79
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.070
The K dead before it was k when the cable was the dream.
Right.

80
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.530
And now that's disappeared.
So there's glory,
glory,
glory,
glory.
Glory is amazing.

81
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.510
But it's not what Katelyn was.
If that makes sense.
It's still still look at UFC.

82
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.000
You look at the joy Saint Pierre's and the John Jones's lifestyles.

83
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.560
It's like holy shit,
that's a different Lee.
That's,
that's uh,
that's pretty cool.

84
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.790
Yeah.
It's,

85
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.570
well the world champions there that that level is and silvers and the,
the,

86
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.520
the,
the rock and the sports cars and the,
they're on the,
they're,
they're amazing.

87
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:11.190
What you can look at it that way.
Yeah,
I guess so.
I think that,
um,

88
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.270
technique wise,
uh,
the,
the kickboxing world is at a very high level though.

89
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.090
Yes.
My world.
Very,
very high level,

90
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.650
which is what was missing like when they were putting on ESPN,
which is too bad.

91
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.120
It's cause it's like the,
if you watch glory,
like the level of fighters there,

92
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.920
it's a very high level of fighter.
You know,

93
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:32.680
but it's just that people are just not aware of it yet.
Yeah.

94
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.560
We need the media exposure.
Um,

95
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.920
say for the Jerry Schilling six for example,
uh,

96
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.700
if you would need the gay Talese house and seeing what he needs to look a person

97
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:45.880
instead of just seeing the bill ring,
how does he put his hand up?
Right.

98
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.850
And then he disappears.
Whereas the UFC,
um,

99
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.370
I know everything about George Saint Pierre without even meeting him.

100
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.190
I know thing about Jon Jones without meeting him.
I know everyone.

101
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.970
And then when they fight,
I feel I have that emotional connection an

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.030
<v 1>I really want to cheer for that guy because I feel like,
uh,</v>

103
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.000
I'm emotionally involved.
Whereas whereas they had the glory guys,

104
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.860
like I can't tell you who's who and who,
who,

105
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.510
how many daughters he has or what kind of pets he has at home.
Um,

106
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.930
one of the things that I really love about just striking about,

107
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.030
I'm obviously a big fan of MMA,

108
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.630
but when you got to think about takedowns and when you have to think about

109
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.600
submissions and,
and there's,
there's so many different things that you know,

110
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.190
a fighter has to consider.
They're not as open with their striking,
their,

111
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.320
they don't have as many,
uh,

112
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.660
moments to just freely exchange without worried about being taken down.
So,

113
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.740
and when you watch like real high level Moitai real high level kickboxing,

114
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.010
you get to see this next level fluidity and this next level technique.

115
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.560
And just,
I mean you see it in boxing as well.

116
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.190
Like I had conversations with people that say like boxing is better.

117
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.010
You never see people land those combinations in the UFC.
And I'm like,

118
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.590
well it's because they're going to take you down.
It's really,

119
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:01.040
you can't stand sideways with your shoulders like that against a really good

120
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:03.200
wrestler cause they're just going to shoot in and take you down.

121
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.290
But that style against someone,

122
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.960
if you make that agreement like it's only going to be stand up,

123
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.740
it's only going to be hands.
You get to see the really high level,

124
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:16.400
the Manny Pacquiao is the Floyd Mayweather is you get to see this just next

125
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:20.450
level technique.
And I feel that same way with kickboxing,

126
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:24.440
I feel like with more time with kickboxing you don't get to see the real high

127
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:29.441
level stuff unless it's just too straight pure strikers in a more time match.

128
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.450
Um,
when I got the opportunity to work with George,
for instance,

129
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.730
the first time that we spot,
I think it's Georgia,

130
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.520
so used to throwing winter these one,
two threes and then uh,

131
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.770
I was literally chasing him from one side of the cage,

132
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.950
the other doing a youtube and then going straight back at him again.

133
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.060
And then after the spy he told me guys felt like I was sparring full guys at

134
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.840
once because it was just relentless today

135
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.910
playing around today,
there was no there,
it's just continuous because there's no,

136
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.700
there's no theory means taking down.
So I can,

137
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.570
I can stand in the pocket and just keep punching in and punching and punching

138
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.280
and punching.
Why was,
I've always equated it to like a conversation.

139
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.150
Like if you have a very crude grasp of the language and you try to have a

140
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.050
conversation with someone,

141
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.840
it can be very frustrating because you're searching for the words.

142
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.640
They don't know exactly what to say,

143
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.890
who are trying to figure out what that person's saying.

144
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.670
But if you're like you or me who speak English very fluently,

145
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:21.580
you and I could have a conversation we don't want,

146
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.410
we could rattle them back and forth.
Well you're that way with striking.

147
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.730
You could tell like striking is like a part of your body's language.
So you're,

148
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:32.060
it's so normal to you.
You're so used to it that the,
the,

149
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:34.220
the combinations just flow like water.

150
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.380
Whereas like you were trying to teach me some things today about the,

151
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.060
the really the unique style that you have of like when you were trying to teach

152
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.260
me that uh,
that crazy power jab and then the setups to those knees.

153
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.410
Like you have a very specific way of moving and I was trying to emulate,

154
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.890
but to you this is ingrained in your nervous system for you,

155
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.040
it just flows out of you,
you know?
Yes.
I've spent my,

156
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 2>that's why I kind of got MMA because I've spent my whole life lending stand up</v>

157
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.300
and I'm in Fia that Yo,
I have this been that a lot.

158
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.300
I'm on my back if I want to reach the same sort of level and I wouldn't do it

159
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:11.150
unless I had that perfection on the floor too.
So yeah,
10 years,
at least,

160
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:12.250
at least 10 years.

161
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.880
I've invested a 2025 years of standup,
striking alone and,

162
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.820
and I don't have any other hobbies.
This list is my life.

163
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.390
All I do is go to the gym and come home.
And then what do you do for fun?
Well,

164
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.140
I just,
that is my fun her and you have to do anything else.
I don't surf.

165
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.530
I don't bride motorbikes.

166
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:32.420
I don't do anything besides watch UFC and trained myself.

167
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.670
It's my life and I love it and I wouldn't change it for nothing either.

168
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.840
Do you have any desire to train Jujitsu just for fun?
Just for a goof?
No,
no.

169
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.350
That's why I come up with the Cajun way tie idea.

170
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.890
Because I want to fight in the cage and I want to experience a little gloves,

171
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.990
but I didn't want to learn that the,
the,
the ground because as,
as,
as,

172
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.380
as much as I respect it,
I'm not good at it and I want to be at a high level.

173
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.140
So we do promotions in Australia,
radio between me and my wife as well.
Why can't,

174
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.750
instead of hiring a ring,
why don't we just hire a cage?
So our um,

175
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.480
studied a little bit on the youtube and I seen it then before and they were

176
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.980
boxing gloves and I thought,

177
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.920
well how am I going to get the respect from the MMA crowd if I wear boxing

178
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:13.740
gloves and they wear little gloves,
right?
I'm going to look like a pussy.

179
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.440
So I thought,
well if I'm going to do it,
I'm going to do it properly.

180
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.940
I'm going to wear the MMA gloves just to show you that I'm just as a warrior,

181
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.710
as the MMA guys are,
so say five with them.
We've done five shows and it's,
um,

182
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.000
it's,
it's amazing.

183
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.210
That's interesting that you say that because I can't imagine you would have to

184
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:34.440
feel like you at this stage of your life with all your accomplishments that you

185
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:38.160
still feel like you have to prove yourself every time.
I still now,

186
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.370
I still don't believe I'm there yet.
That's hilarious.

187
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.450
That's actually hilarious.
I mean,

188
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.200
you ever look at your own resume yet,
but want to pull it up real quick.

189
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.630
Let's pull it up at work.
So I'll just,
I'll just let you know what you've done.

190
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.560
Just like feel better.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm quite content where I'm at,

191
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.890
but it's always feels like I want to be more famous.
Uh,
that's a word.

192
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.370
Yeah,
no.
Well it definitely makes it makes sense.
I mean,
just,
I get that.

193
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.840
I mean,
all high level athletes will tell you that they're never satisfied.
Yup.

194
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.360
Yup.

195
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.130
And I guess when you see guys fighting with striking with little gloves and you

196
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.290
see that you're using the larger gloves,

197
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.340
maybe that just makes you feel like you have to show that you're capable of

198
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:24.130
doing that as well.
Yeah,
I have the highest cause cause like I said before,
I,

199
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.850
every weekend I'm invested in the paper view on UFC.

200
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:31.500
I'm watching the reruns and I can tell ya who,
like last night for instance,

201
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.240
who was fighting who two years ago,

202
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:35.800
who won that flight out to such and such like,
um,

203
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.020
I'm so involved that it's sort of taken over my life,

204
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:44.010
the UFC even on my Moitai UFC sort of such a big part of me.
Neil.

205
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:49.110
Um,
yeah,
it's,
it's hard to explain when you read off your titles,

206
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.490
it's almost ridiculous.
Tet,
this is hilarious.
Oh,

207
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.430
wk world middleweight title Wk

208

212
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.720

213
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:15.430

214

216
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:23.890
It just goes on and on and non Australian boxing middleweight champion King's

217
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:27.970
Cup tournament champion.
It's like over and over and over and over and over.

218
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.230
The fact that after all these accomplishments and he's still feel like you have

219
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:36.370
to prove yourself.
Yeah,
like I said with the the UFC,

220
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.220
like I see the Georges and the join James's and it's like,

221
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:43.090
why can't I can be that guy?
I want to be that guy.
You mean that guy?

222
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.110
Meaning getting the respect or getting the adulation of getting the,

223
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:50.490
the focus on you that these guys are getting the EA and this would have been

224
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.500
pretty much,
it's crazy because if you watch it,
I've always said this,

225
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.900
it's not like the product isn't there.

226
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.410
I'll give you watch high level Moitai and I watched a lot of your fights last

227
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.600
night after we did the podcast together.

228
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:04.900
I went back and this morning I watched the documentary on your life,

229
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:09.901
which was amazing and I watched some of your fights and you know,

230
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.860
uh,
the,
the product is there.
That's what's crazy.
It's like,
it's a dynamic,

231
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.720
exciting product.
I'm a boxing fan,

232
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:20.080
but if you give me a chance between watching a choice,

233
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:23.520
rather between watching high level boxing and watching high level Moy,
Tai,

234
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.070
I'll tech high level more tie all the time because the possibilities are more

235
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:31.600
the knees,
the elbows,
the high kicks,
leg kicks,
all those things together.

236
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.850
It's more dynamic,
there's more things going on.

237
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.030
So there's no reason why people shouldn't know about who you are.

238
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.760
I mean,
that's what,
it's weird.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My,
my,

239
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.760
my popularity on the social media,

240
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:49.090
it didn't explode until I started training George and then everyone said it.
Oh,

241
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.550
hang on a second.
Who's the split?
Was He teaching George headed?

242
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.270
And then from there is that open up avenues and then,
uh,

243
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.680
before that I was just a Yay.
Just that.

244
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:02.020
Then I did the exposure isn't that they're,
I guess they're like,
yeah,

245
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.880
this new opportunity.
It's exactly where the UFC was at one point in time.

246
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.900
I mean there was a a time in the 90s when the UFC was banned from cable when the

247
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:16.570
UFC was only,
you could only get it on direct TV and a fucking,

248
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:19.270
nobody knew who it was.
I mean I was on news radio,

249
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:22.920
which was a sitcom in America and I was starting to do the interview is that

250
00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:26.530
post fight interviews and I would tell them that I would do it and people would

251
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:31.090
look at me like I'm ruining my life by being involved in this nefarious

252
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:33.890
adventure to go and watch people fight in a cage.
Like,
like,

253
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.270
like I was going to go watch lions fight to the death or something.
It was just,

254
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.350
it was weird.
It was like,

255
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.620
like you were talking about porn or even worse than porn.

256
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:45.520
It was like animal porn or something.
It was,
it's strange,
but now it's a,

257
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.610
a normal,
like if you tell people the UFC,
oh,
I've seen that.

258
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:51.920
Even if the casual person is aware of its,
it's

259
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 2>gotten into the public's eye enough where the casual person is it,
you know,
it's,</v>

260
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.320
it's a part of this is like geist moit ties,
not I um,

261
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.870
I had an opportunity to fight in Thailand and a,

262
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.680
it was an eight man tournament and had to fight three times in two hours and it

263
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:10.960
was,
it was live on TV and it was,
it smashes build up and a I,

264
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.840
I fought three times and I beat the,
the Russian,
the fringe.

265
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.280
I beat a tie in the final,
I won a world title and million baht,

266
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.090
which is about 35,000 and I want to try food from the prime minister of
Thailand.

267
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.820
And I got back to Australia and I rang the,

268
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.020
the Brisbane newspaper and there's a big newspaper in Brizzy and then they've

269
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.420
come around and then I've just won this.

270
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.360
And then this prime traveling from the prime minister and the lady on the other

271
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:39.150
end said,
well,
it sounds like you're exaggerating all this.
Um,

272
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.050
why don't you just try your local newspaper and hung up on me before I even got

273
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.830
a chance to say good boy.
She was like,
and it's like we,

274
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:48.460
we only deal in football and cricket here in Australia.
Um,

275
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.110
and because it's not a mainstream sport.
Yeah.
Just try your local paper.

276
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.090
Hopefully they'll do something for you.
That's hilarious.

277
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:57.540
That cricket as a mainstream sport and what ties welcome to Australia.

278
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.490
I don't mean to be rude if you're a cricket fan cause I lock a lot of stupid

279
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:05.510
shit.
I'm aware.
I'm like,
I'm a,
I'm a big fan of professional pool.

280
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:09.620
I like watching people go,
you really Wa,
you know,
you're not even playing it.

281
00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:14.180
You Watch it.
Yes,
it's true.
I watch stupid shit.
But Cricket Australia,

282
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:18.830
we play India.
Um,
probably once a week.
Every weekend that makes the back page,

283
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:21.780
the front page,
the six 30 news,
the limits,

284
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.480
the main story every single day and such and such is the Bowler Mako class got a

285
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:29.960
sore leg and then wirelessly interviewing Marco clock,
all this interview,

286
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.470
the answer like,
God,
this is,
and then one game lasts for days.

287
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.370
And so you can imagine the game last four days,

288
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.750
how many hours did they play?
Four.
Oh,
oh,
oh day.
They,
yeah,

289
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.320
they rock up in the morning and they,
they,
they go.
And if they're not out there,

290
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:49.840
just keep going and going and going.
And it's,
it's tedious.
Why not?

291
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.350
You know what?
I know how to fix it.
Incorporate Moy,
Tai and cricket.

292
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.430
So like if you strike out,
you just fucking Duke it out.

293
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.290
Take off that stupid fencing helmet where it's,
I don't,

294
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.530
I just said,
well,
it sews baseball.
Baseball's kind of silly to,

295
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:10.380
and it's our national pastime,
but when you start using that paddle,
you know,

296
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.790
like that fucking boat or that they smack that ball where it's,
I just,

297
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.450
I don't know,
I don't get it.
But then the guys in the suits,

298
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:21.650
the politicians in Australia to the cage is still illegal in Melbourne.
I still,

299
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.680
they've just bandit in Perth in Western Australia banned it now about a year

300
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.730
ago.
It was,
it was okay.
And then I've just come around and then they've been,

301
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.050
and I have a cage in my gym and it's like just step into a cage.

302
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:36.560
The realize how the safe and protected is compared to a ring.
Once you step,

303
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.100
once you step into it and appreciate what it is for what it is,
um,

304
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.220
you'll understand that it's so much better than falling out of a ring.

305
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.830
That's a meter and a half hallway.
Yeah,

306
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.620
the ring is not the best for MMA for sure.

307
00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:52.290
But I think for striking think so as well,

308
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.540
because of the clenching and the throws and all that stuff.

309
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.900
I've seen more people fall out of a ring,
then I'll never had a cage of course.

310
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.360
But,
but dad with this guy's pulling out all the time.

311
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.590
I've seen the Dylan last time you were here,
uh,
he's not on camera right now.

312
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.250
There any,
hey Dylan,
what's heading it?

313
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.810
I don't know if he'll turn that on a Dylan reznikoff I said that right,
right.

314
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.920
I said,
all right.
You see what was brother Liam a while back was like a year ago.

315
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.880
You guys are here,
but in there,
there we go.

316
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.640
You guys showed a video of this dude who,
uh,
he was,
uh,

317
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.640
like running and attacking and he went flying out of the ring,
right?
Denver.

318
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:26.880
This rainbow was it?

319
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.450
They had Lynn Peeney was that he was you guys that showed that video,
right?

320
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:32.130
Wasn't it navy?
He might've been.

321
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.760
Tim had so many said as he's falling out of the ring,
he puts his hands at the,

322
00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:40.350
the brace.
He's full.
He puts a hand on the eye to eye check.

323
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:45.390
He chain the chairs split.
No,
it pulls straight on.
He's nick.
Oh No.
And then he,

324
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:48.810
I think he was in a coma for like a month to two because he fell from about two

325
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:50.190
meters high.
He fell at the top row.

326
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.860
Say incorporate that from the ring to the concrete floor.
Uh,

327
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.620
do you remember back in the day they used to run nom events cause the cage is

328
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:01.110
banned in New South Wales.
All your waste you're in Queensland,
sorry.

329
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.400
And I think it was tiny Brunello show and then they used to have not out of a

330
00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:06.721
cage.

331
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:10.110
So what they did is that the platform and they had all the big boys like Tama to

332
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.020
Hoonah and Jamie to her and and all those boys standing around at the kick

333
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.480
shields and guys are just getting catch guys.

334
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.550
Yeah you guys are getting like dropped in the heads.

335
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:19.600
We hit in the side and this is madness.

336
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.690
This Friday they used to push physically push guys back in and I think,

337
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:30.171
I think it was a Paulo Filio once caught some guy in a triangle through the

338
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:34.200
ropes.
He like he had his,
his,

339
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
the guy who was somehow another the trapped in the rope.

340
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:39.450
There was a limb out of the rope and a limb in a rope,

341
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.620
so the rope of the triangle was involved in the triangle.
Hey,

342
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.920
I mean the rope of the ring rather was involved in him securing the triangle.

343
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.410
It was like the guy was like tight tangled in it,

344
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.310
like that's not good and that that stop,
start,
stop,

345
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.490
start dragging back in the and that's on your Alma was here,
this or and go.

346
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.160
I've been in,
I've been talking about this for a while,

347
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:04.050
that if they can have a big room for basketball,
a big flat service,

348
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.650
why can't they have a big flat surface for fighting where everyone can see what

349
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:10.740
the fuck's going on because you're,
you don't see what's going on.

350
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.420
A lot of times with the cage,
even me,

351
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.390
like I'm right there when I'm calling UFC fights,

352
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:18.270
but sometimes a post is in the way or it's around,

353
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:22.020
there were like a sideway like I have to lean up to try to see because it's like

354
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.270
kind of like I'm looking sideways through the cage.

355
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.340
I think that a flat surface would eliminate a lot of the stalling and a lot of

356
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:32.220
the,
uh,
you know,
the,
the pressing,
the clinching up against the cage,

357
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:35.520
like clenching and a center is a totally different animal.

358
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.480
And when you're leaning on someone pressing someone against the case that it

359
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:44.240
takes out a large factor.
Yep.
Um,
and do you think about that?

360
00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:46.620
And then that's possible.
I reckon that's fantastic.

361
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.750
You wouldn't be at a cage walk either with your shoulders in the center of the

362
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.490
sound.
You've got to fight for it.

363
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.130
You got to actually fight for it or learn how to fight off your back.

364
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.650
It'd be hot.
Yeah.
I mean there's guys that are really danger,

365
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.710
like trials all of is one of the best in the UFC at fighting off of his back.

366
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:02.470
He saw his last fight with Jeremy Stevens.
I don't know if you're aware of him,

367
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:05.740
but he's got a vicious guard.
His guard,
he's attacking all the time.

368
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.740
So when you take that guy down,
it's no fucking picnic.
You know,
he's,

369
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:10.600
he's constantly threatening your arm,
your neck,

370
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.940
and those guys are going to excel in a world where you can't just,

371
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.140
you can't just hold a guy against the cage or if you take a guy down,

372
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:21.190
he can't just wall walk.

373
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:24.130
A guy is going to have to fight off of his back and I feel like that's more,

374
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.100
more honest,
you know?
I mean the cage,

375
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.850
the cage is a real element of MMA and guys train for it and therefore you should

376
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:33.340
be able to utilize it.
If you're a professional,
you should understand it,

377
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.700
but it also puts a weird taste in people's mouths.
Like,
oh,

378
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:40.000
they're fighting cages or animals.
It's awesome.

379
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.670
I love it here.
I live in,
they're mad men.
Even either vote we do with the CMT,

380
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.830
the cage stuff.
Soon as they closed the door,

381
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:50.310
it just seems like a chew and you opponent and the,
the,

382
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.080
the black of the fence just makes it like a black wall.

383
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:55.030
So you can't see the crowd,
you can't see the judges.

384
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.420
It's just feels like the,
the arena.
It's just you and him.
Yeah.

385
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:04.630
That is cool.
That,
that aspect of it too.
Um,

386
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.460
but I just feel like visually,
like as far as like for being able to see,

387
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.490
it's not the best ring.
It's better to see 120 fights in the,
Oh,

388
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.770
115 flights in a,
in a ring.
And then in the cage,
it just feels like you're,

389
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:21.690
it's all,
it's you again.
It's all fresh.
It's all exciting.
So That's interesting.

390
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.950
That's why I love it.
So just,
just changing the environment.
Yay.

391
00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:28.480
You made it all totally different for you and the little gloves,

392
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.480
the full him little gloves,
little gloves,
and make it more real.

393
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.870
Did you ever do kickboxing where there was no elbows,
like glory style,

394
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.410
no elbows and one of these no clinch default Katelyn for a couple of years in

395
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:41.860
Japan.
And then,
um,
when I first started it was an immature,

396
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.770
of course I just thought had babies and baby steps.

397
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.370
I did the eight count rule back in the day we had today keeps above the waist if

398
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.530
they didn't want to go to the PKA stuff.
PK,
they,

399
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:53.650
we do that since you did that with no,
uh,
no leg kicks and the only,

400
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:57.160
once I only went there was like Hexion bolts but leg kicks in school that had to

401
00:22:57.161 --> 00:23:01.810
be above the waist.
They get the,
the count they didn't want boxing to,

402
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.140
there's so many guys that are doing karate that changed over the kickboxing

403
00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.020
boxing that changed over the kickboxing and said they wanted to eliminate the

404
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:09.610
hands and make more guys kicked more.

405
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.980
So it had to be at least eight keeps above the waist but you still lucky.

406
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.400
That's interesting.
Um,

407
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.450
so you could still debilitate a guy and it wouldn't count point wise.

408
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.490
That's kind of crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Australia.

409
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.340
So what is the role with glory?

410
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:27.420
Like they let you throw needs but you can't clench when you throw a knee or k

411
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.090
one had it for you could only clinch with one or hand for awhile.
Yeah.

412
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.180
2004 you were lonely as you are busy in the clinch that let it go and then bore

413
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:36.010
cal came along and just dominated everybody.

414
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:41.011
He was throwing them around like rag dolls and he busted up merge Massada I

415
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.290
remember Masato and then um,
say the very next year and I,
okay,

416
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.580
we've got a new rule one hand,

417
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:50.270
one knee and then that gives the guys that are proper,
um,

418
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.770
more boxing orientated.

419
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.250
I an opportunity to fight guys like workout where they had no chance before.

420
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.500
Well Alistair over too.

421
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.170
He used to just clinch guys with those gigantic fucking tree trunk arms.

422
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.040
Just hold on your neck and your Donesville he just blast those knees into you.

423
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.420
You ever seen a,
that fight that he fought?
I forget who it was,
uh,

424
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.460
to Sherra where he,
he hit him,

425
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.510
he clenched with both hands behind the neck and hit him with a knee and it

426
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:18.710
looked like he got shot.
Like someone hit him with a sniper bullet,
boom.

427
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:19.544
It just goes down.

428
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.870
You know that that clenched though is such an effective weapon.
It just,

429
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:28.100
it doesn't make any sense to me to eliminate that when I see it being eliminated

430
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:30.800
in kickboxing in or making guys,
you know,

431
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:34.240
we'll use one hand or something like that.
I'm like,
that's so,
it's so foolish.

432
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:35.390
It doesn't make any sense to me.

433
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:38.270
It's like you eliminating a really exciting aspect of,

434
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.690
and a crucial aspect of the art of Moy Tai.
Yeah.

435
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:46.280
The ties are so efficient in it.
They're,
they're so good and so powerful.

436
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:47.900
And you can see the shots and you can see that.

437
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:50.790
You can hear the noise bell in western Westerners get into the clean sheet,

438
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.740
sort of like a two dogs that are trying to make puppets.

439
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.140
It's not quite
hilarious.

440
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.200
The referee gets a bucket of water to get off each other to a male dog.

441
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.190
Yay.
That's funny.

442
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.180
That's why eliminate because are the western is aren't very good at the toys

443
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:15.250
when they,
they get able and as it throw knee for knee.
Um,
yeah.

444
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.970
So that made it more entertaining for the crowd,
I guess.
Yeah.
I don't know,
man.

445
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:21.110
I think even the crowd,

446
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:25.470
like that's one of the things that drives me nuts about modern MMA is standups.

447
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.810
When,

448
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.000
when guys get taken down and they're fighting on the ground and then they get

449
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:31.520
stood back up.
I mean,
I just,
I just think it's ridiculous.

450
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:33.500
Like if you only have five minutes,

451
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:35.840
especially me coming from a Jujitsu background,

452
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.270
if you have five minutes and you take a guy down,

453
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.710
it's a lot of times it's a slow progression to a submission and you,
you know,

454
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.740
you can't be like,
you're like,
come on guys,
let's work.
Let's work.

455
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:48.740
Like they're fucking working.
Okay.
But sometimes when guys are working,

456
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:49.574
it's a stalemate.

457
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.640
Like sometimes you're trying to pass the guy trying to stop you from passing.

458
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.260
You tried to advance on the other side.

459
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.180
The guy tries to stop you from the other side.
Like there's,

460
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.800
there's a lot of shit going on.
There's a lot of shit going on and uh,

461
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:04.670
unexperienced referees or referees that are unexperienced in grappling or

462
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:06.860
referees that are easily influenced by the crowd.

463
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.170
Like sometimes they'll hear booing and you know,

464
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:13.070
you just see what are you going to,
there's this show for assholes.
You know,

465
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.340
people who don't understand fighting,
you're going to stand them up,

466
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:18.760
stand them up during them up.
Okay.
Stand them up.
No,

467
00:26:18.761 --> 00:26:19.850
these guys are trying to fight.

468
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.700
Elite XC was the worst example of that big country.

469
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:27.701
Roy Nelson had Andre Arlovski down inside control working at Kamora and they

470
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:31.010
stood them up.
Oh,
it was fucking ridiculous.

471
00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:34.070
They had like a 15 second thing where if you went to the ground,

472
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:37.670
if something didn't happen in 15 seconds,
they stood you up.
Saying same sometimes

473
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.520
when the UFC as well,

474
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:43.120
when they press against the cage and there's this stalemate,

475
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.010
we absolutely nothing's

476
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.490
<v 1>happening at all,
I think.
I think that's the same as the Moitai.</v>

477
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.750
Have you pushed him against the ropes and you're holding holding and you're not

478
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.940
throwing anything?
All right then.
Then you've got to do it,

479
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:54.300
but if they're busy for sure.
Let it go.
Keep it going.
Yeah.
I don't know.

480
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:56.610
I just don't think you ever see that with high level guys.

481
00:26:56.611 --> 00:27:00.360
I think that's just a part of being a fighter who's not that good or a fighter

482
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:03.240
who's learning while you see a guy like Cain Velasquez,

483
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.660
Cain Velasquez never gets worn to keep moving.
You know?

484
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:09.210
He's fucking punching you in the face.
He's taking you down.

485
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.140
It's like he's constantly in motion and that's why he's one of the elite of the

486
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:16.270
elite.
You don't see that stalling,
that really stuck,

487
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.290
you know that kind of stalling on high level guys.
Yup.

488
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.960
I just think he got to let them fight.

489
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.860
It's ridiculous enough like five minutes is a small amount of time for a

490
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:27.120
grappler.
You know,

491
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:31.290
and sometimes guys just are trying to work techniques and they're getting,

492
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.840
they're getting you know,
stalled out or they're getting um,

493
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.530
someone's using good defense and the referee just stand them up like,

494
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.540
well that's what Jujitsu is all about.

495
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.010
It's all about the guy defense and you try a different way.
Die Defends.

496
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.250
You need to try to keep hammering at them until he can't keep the rhythm up and

497
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.280
then you advance and then eventually you catch them.
But sometimes you'll be,

498
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.260
the guy will be defending like a wizard.

499
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:56.880
Like if you watch two guys roll too high level guys like it is like we were

500
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:59.310
expressing before,
it's like a conversation there.

501
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.820
They're arguing about shit and they're trying to find holes in each other's
game.

502
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.330
And it'll go on where it looks like as a stalemate for five minutes,

503
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:10.300
but save like it's like a Marcello Garcia character and he's fighting a guy who

504
00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:13.020
was really athletic and you think you go,
man,

505
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.240
is how long can this guy hold Marcello off?

506
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.790
And that's really what the question is.
It's not a matter of,
Oh,

507
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:20.760
this guy is just as good as Marcel.
Not really.
No.

508
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.060
Eventually he's going to figure out the right combination of things to do to

509
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:27.060
this guy and he's gonna have his back.
And then once he has his back,

510
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:30.570
that guy's fucked.
But it's like how long does it take to get them there?

511
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.610
And in an MMA halfway there,
you're like,
boom.

512
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.680
Stirred them up,
stirring them up.
Well,

513
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.740
you're never going to see the most high level practitioner succeed if that's the

514
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:45.960
tactic.
You know,
you're never gonna see it.
Get to that point,

515
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.450
and I think that's unfortunate about MMA today,

516
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.410
is that they still have that standup thing.
I think standup's are,

517
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.620
I think it's a travesty.
I really do.
Even in Thailand and say,

518
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.560
say we kicked three rounds in the pads of five ends in the peds,

519
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.600
that that's a 15,
20 minutes,

520
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.190
but then every afternoon you spending half an hour in the clinch work in the

521
00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:05.280
knees nonstop for half an hour.

522
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.260
I said they're spending more time working on that.

523
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:10.620
Then they actually kicking and punching things and then when it's time to come

524
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:14.280
to the,
when the toys got to Europe and stuff,
all of a sudden it was like a,
uh,

525
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.880
one knee combination before they break it up.
So they'd taken away.

526
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.260
My name is Sandra,
their tools.

527
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.090
That's an interesting thing you were talking about last night about Moy Tai

528
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.100
scoring that the clinching is like a big part of the scoring.

529
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.150
Whereas we look at clinching is stalling out or like,
you know,

530
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:36.840
something that they're doing where they're trying to like wait by their time

531
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:41.710
figuring out what to do next.
Like in Thailand,
it's a big aspect of,
of the,
yeah.

532
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.220
Um,

533
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.490
<v 2>this morning we mentioned it as well.
Uh,
the Brown one,</v>

534
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.080
if they don't get in the clinch,
none.
One bits,

535
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.180
no one bets until halfway through round two.

536
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.290
All of a sudden they get into the a clinch and then it's like boom,
the,

537
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:52.720
you see the,

538
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.660
just the hands go crazy cause everyone's their own bookmaker in Thailand.
So,

539
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.290
so everyone's doing their own odds and then they won't bit until they know the

540
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:04.090
other guy's got a solid solid base or a solid because what was so wild that's so

541
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:06.580
wild.
The difference in their culture is so amazing.

542
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.590
It's just I really have to get over there.

543
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.700
It's one of the things I want to do on my bucket list is go and watch a stadium

544
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:16.030
fight in Thailand.
Like a real high level fight.
Watch the,
you know,

545
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:17.710
be there for the whole night getting check it.

546
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.940
I'm almost willing to take a family vacation to Thailand and talk my wife.

547
00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:23.600
And you're going to Thailand because that's what probably a fucking email and

548
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:23.971
say.

549
00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:28.971
So the boxing hardly score lake keeps doing school and only body kicks,

550
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.970
knees,
elbows,
body kicks,
knees and elbows and leg kicks.
Don't,

551
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:36.660
Harley's score legs keep things cool cause it's so easy to throw a lake.

552
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.460
Anyone can throw leaky but it's,
it takes a high level to land a solid.

553
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.970
Even if it kicks the arms,
that's considered a a point as well.
If you do,

554
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:45.480
if you get kicked in the arms without attempting to try and block it,
that's it.

555
00:30:45.481 --> 00:30:50.380
That's a free point.
How many guys get arms broken in Thailand?
Uh,

556
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.070
I haven't seen many.
No.
That's amazing cause it's really common in MMA.

557
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.610
I seen him go,
I get his thigh brogue.
That was pretty crazy.
Whoa.
It was hectic.

558
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.541
I seen he,

559
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:02.440
he hit the ground and then he was on his side and he went to rollover and he's,

560
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.650
he's hip went first and then his leg went second and I was like,

561
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.710
oh that's broken for sure.
And the next day,
sure enough,

562
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:12.700
completely snapped in half.
Had to get the pins.
It,
it's all in the magazines.

563
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.740
It was,
um,
it was very nice.
The analytic data,

564
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:19.720
you have to get the pins and Thailand,
hey,
it's really good.
Thailand,

565
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:24.510
the hospital,
the hospitals are more hygienic than now in Australia.
Oh,

566
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.130
well that's not good for Australia.
I need,

567
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:29.980
I need off the floor at a hospital in Thailand for sure.
Really?

568
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.210
So they have really good,
which just pretty amazing.
Yeah.

569
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.500
American asshole that I am.
Um,
so what did he get his leg broken?
Windows.
A cat.

570
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.130
Yeah,
the guy just born.
We just chopped it hard.
Damn man.
Yeah,
just snapped.

571
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:50.070
It was a very,
do remember Stan longe anitas versus Dennis Lexia.
Yes,
I do.
Yeah.

572
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.850
It was a big of the big hype in Australia.

573
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:55.830
That was massive in the last 15 seconds.
Stand the man that was,

574
00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.640
he had a motherfucker of a leg kick.
Che's Christ.
Yes.
God Damn.

575
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.430
He used to work with my French Shuki Shuki for Magiro Gym.
Okay.

576
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.090
Shuki uh,
had a,
um,

577
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.190
he was from Israel and he had a gym out here in Encino and uh,
he was,

578
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.990
he was set up for a hip replacement from fucking holding the pads from Stan

579
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:20.470
longe.
Anitas Huh?
Holding that,
that five pad.
He said,

580
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.960
that motherfucker would kick me so hard that it would like,

581
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:27.340
it was like jolting his hips had fucked up the inside of his hip.
That's amazing.

582
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:32.170
Yeah.
Wow.
Fuck heavyweights.
Kicking you,
dude.
Fuck all that.

583
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.550
Stan was,
he's a big guy,
right?
Uh,
he's not very tall.
He's only about my height,

584
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.270
but the boy,
and then,
um,

585
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.960
that was his main weapon was the delay kicks of the hands.

586
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.550
That was a first round kick too.
I mean that was amazing.
That was amazing.

587
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.370
The whole Napa guys femur with one leg,
the whole hype.

588
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:51.980
And then maybe he books are coming out and then us Alexia,

589
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.350
he was the king back then to say this was stands,
hottest fight.
And the,

590
00:32:56.351 --> 00:33:01.040
the big lead up and then the,
the Soledad arena.
And then,
um,
then,
uh,

591
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.920
Dennis Lexia commit in the grass skirt,
that Hawaii thing.
Yeah.

592
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.320
That he was thinking that was gonna help the impact for the psychic.

593
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.280
So they have a bit of cushioning,
but it sort of reversed on him.
He,

594
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.710
cause he checked it,
it was a chick.

595
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.540
He checked it and then he went to put his foot down.

596
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:17.270
That's when he's like Shane's snipped.
Wow.
That was his shin.

597
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.320
It wasn't just thought three by three shinbones God damn.

598
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.360
Wow.
I didn't know why did I think it was the thigh bone and it was so long ago.

599
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.820
They did a story on it because as he put his chick checkup,
he's put,
he's uh,

600
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.420
incident with his foot on his knee.

601
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.550
So there was no give instead of having the leg fluffy and then he's,

602
00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:38.000
he's locked in into his other leg and then as he's kicked through it was like

603
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:42.380
kicking,
throw a baseball bat.
Oh,
I see.
Oh,
all kind of down it done.

604
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:46.820
The done the Anderson Silva,
the blip.
Wow.
That's amazing.

605
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.570
It's rare that you see it on two high level guys like that where you see a leg

606
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:50.991
break luck,

607
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:55.991
that maybe protein injectable protein like you really mean protein.

608
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.110
Did you see his fight?
Um,
Dennis.

609
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:06.470
Lexi was fight with Don Wilson as when he got schooled on leg kicks.

610
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.210
No Dude.
Back when the day when the dentist's Lexio was a young man,

611
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.630
he wasn't schooled in the ways of the low kick and he fought Don the dragon.

612
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:19.340
Wilson and Dawn Wilson fucked him up with low kicks.
Huh?
Defense and low kicks.

613
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.810
Yeah.
There's a guy that doesn't get enough credit.

614
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.570
Don Wilson had sort of like a weird sort of karate style,

615
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.840
but he knew how to through good low kick.
You know,
he,

616
00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:30.620
he was a very crafty fighter.
Yup.
Yup.
Um,
Jeez,
we're going back in time now.

617
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:36.080
Now we're in the 80s.
I think I need to go before then you go to,
you know,

618
00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:37.750
you got to go to where we talked about earlier.

619
00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:42.000
It's Dennis a superfood and pointless.
Oh yeah.
But there was something,

620
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.550
not just Dennis,
let's go a,

621
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:47.810
you go dawn Wilson and then you go Benny or keyed his or Ketos was fucking shit.

622
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.240
Yeah.
I trained at his gym.
When I first moved to La,

623
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:52.770
there was a first place I went to,
I was like,
I'm going to the jet center,

624
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.360
one of the way along pain,
say bed,
which he knows his stuff.

625
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.610
What about the foot things that you want to wear?
The foot cushion.

626
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:00.020
But my first fight was,
um,

627
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.350
the Shin pads with the foot questions and spy with a foot questions too.

628
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.540
So that they were,
they were in back then when,

629
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.100
when Chuck Norris had that world combat league and he was doing a very similar

630
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:12.440
thing to what we're talking about where they fight like kind of in a,

631
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:14.810
a small bowl,
like a saucer.

632
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.300
Like they didn't have a ring and they didn't have a cage.

633
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.950
They had just this sort of slightly elevated platform that had a lip to it.

634
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.960
So when they get to the outside edge,
you know,

635
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:25.050
the referee would bring them back in.

636
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:26.510
And I thought it was a very smart way to do it.

637
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.350
Did you think about fighting in that at all?
Uh,
I was still a puppy.
I'm only,

638
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.380
I was only a few years ago.
Yeah.
Mainly not,
you're only to add,
ain't no,

639
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.010
you're 38 now,
right?
Yeah.
We could

640
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.300
<v 3>tell people you're not a check.
Um,
but that wasn't that long ago.</v>

641
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:46.320
You had to be like that was,
well the guy,
I don't think it was 10 years ago,

642
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.720
I think world combat league was like,
I want to say it was like,

643
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.620
I know I was working for the UFC at the time because I went to see one live.

644
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.660
Okay.
And uh,
I got a hug from chuck motherfucking norm

645
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.360
back in the day.
I was so mad that I didn't get a picture of it.
And you lived,

646
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.610
yeah,
I did.
I lived,
I felt different though.

647
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.000
It's like I touched a lightning bolt and you got pregnant.
I might have.

648
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.470
Um,
but so you didn't,
you didn't think about fighting.
Okay.

649
00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:17.250
What Katelyn was the dream,
right?
Caitlin was the,
the,
the Pinnacle,

650
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.720
the pinnacle if you'd say,
um,
that was a bummer that that kind of folded under.

651
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.150
I was trying to get the UFC to by k one a long time ago.

652
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:27.060
And the number one thing that I talked to Dana white about,
he's like,
ah,

653
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.240
people don't like kickboxing.
That PKA karate ruined it for everybody.

654
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.261
And I was like,

655
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:34.770
that's so crazy that to say that because like that's like saying that like UFC

656
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:39.630
one ruined it for like what we're seeing today because this is so not related.

657
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.610
Like the product itself,
they,
the kickboxing product itself was so high level.

658
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.560
When you go to the fights,
the,
the,
the,
the classics,
the Peter Arts fight,

659
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:52.950
the nd Hook,
you know the Mike Bernardo,
those,
those fights,

660
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:55.950
those fucking Jerome Le Banner,
those were crazy fights.

661
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:57.750
I mean if you look at that product,

662
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:00.700
I couldn't imagine anybody not wanting to put on those fights.
Yeah.

663
00:37:00.701 --> 00:37:04.890
The production level to everything was high definition.

664
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:08.530
The slow is the highlight packages they'd make up you,

665
00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:10.640
you couldn't help but feel like this was the,

666
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.690
I was lucky enough to fight there in 2004 2005 and we'll pull in 40,000 people

667
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.080
every show that's and in,

668
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.960
and we had a live 40,000 people and that you'd walk out to the arena and then

669
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:25.290
you check out the stage and sometimes you come up through the flow for your

670
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:28.500
walkout or,
yeah,
it was just unbelievable.

671
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.650
They had like some elevator that would make you rise up through the floor.

672
00:37:31.651 --> 00:37:32.070
I remember.

673
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.860
And the back room went and I was trying to find the stairs and I've asked the

674
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:38.580
lady,
where do I go?
And she goes,
oh,
stand on that thing.
It's like,
no way.

675
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:42.470
And she goes,
Oh yes.
I was like,
fuck yes.
And then,
um,

676
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.890
I remember coming up through the floor and then all of a sudden there's 40,000

677
00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:49.770
people right in front of you.
And it's like,
wow,
he's amazing.

678
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.420
And then we had a TV audience of 20 million people in Tokyo also.

679
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.340
So it would be a delayed broadcast by about an hour.
I said,

680
00:37:58.341 --> 00:38:01.440
by the time we finish our flight and then on the bus we'll have a TV on the bus

681
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:05.760
and pretty much what you'll find as your way back to the hotel.
Wow.

682
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.300
But Thailand was pretty cool to Thailand.
We have crowds.

683
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:11.750
I'm song shy who was fighting for,
he'd have 'em,

684
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.250
he'd make all these money from the TV production.

685
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.680
So he do live shows in the middle of nowhere.

686
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.840
And people would drive for hours to be present to for a live event and we'd have

687
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:24.060
40,000,
60,000.
Um,

688
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.480
there's this one big event once a year called the king's birthday and we get

689
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:30.710
100,000 people plus every year and the 5th of December.
Oh,

690
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.600
I was lucky to fight on then a four years in a row.

691
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.330
So the first time I went on the ring,
it was the first time that I,

692
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.710
my knees went weak because as far as I could see was the ocean a heads and I

693
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:45.150
started trembling and then I've come out in the first round,
I've tried this,

694
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.830
I've tried to finish him,
and then by the fifth round I sort of spent my pennies.

695
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.570
It fell over a couple of times and then I'm losing them points.

696
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.880
And then the next year I got invited back and I sit on,

697
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:58.190
I'm not going to get spooked yet at this time,
this time,
like,
like the UFC,
Judas,

698
00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.230
like you talk about it all the time.

699
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.070
I had the is the first and the second time I was like,
no,
I'm not going to,

700
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.360
I'm going to just tell them I'm going to love it and I'm going to absorb it.

701
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:08.530
I'm going to run with it.
So I've got it there.
Big Breath in 100,000 people.

702
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.870
And then,
um,
I had the greatest fight of my life.

703
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:12.850
There was 10 western is verse 10 toys.

704
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:16.150
And I was the only Westerner to win getting high fives from ties on the way back

705
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:18.930
to the change room.
And then the last time I did it,
um,

706
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.810
there was probably only 95,000 people had a little tiny kid and I was looking at

707
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:27.430
the Beck on,
ah,
Geez,
what's going?
Where is everyone?
This is,
this is,
this is sad.

708
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.290
Yeah,
it was nuts.
But you know,

709
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.380
you could tell the difference between 95,000 and a hundred thousand.
Uh,

710
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.740
there was,

711
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.380
there was a little spot near the hot dog stand where you could have been
another,

712
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.830
the 5,000 people easy.
What is that?

713
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:42.940
Like 100,000 people?
Sometimes a,

714
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.470
you'd have to get a police escort.

715
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.500
So you'd have three policemen either Saudia and they'd push people out of the

716
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:50.120
way for you as you make your way towards the crowd just to get through it.

717
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.051
And you're the West Center.

718
00:39:51.051 --> 00:39:55.870
So imagine you're the one off three or four westerners that are on the show and

719
00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:58.090
you're just surrounded by Thai people.
That and that,
that stage,

720
00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:01.450
I couldn't really speak Thai very well either.
And um,
they just look at,
you know,

721
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:04.660
like some sort of freak that you're dead,
you're dead,
you're fighting one of us,

722
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:05.380
and then you go,

723
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.680
then you go on beat one of them and then all of a sudden they're high five and

724
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:10.700
year and checking your hand and one photo with you.

725
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.020
And it's just really amazing soul.

726
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.090
You didn't experience as much racism over there.

727
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.370
If you go out there and fight as hard as you can,
win,
lose or draw,
even if you,

728
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:24.370
if you lose,
but you fight like a,
uh,
like you're a man possessed.
Um,

729
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.020
they love you.
They,
there's no,
there's no hatred.
There's no longer,

730
00:40:28.021 --> 00:40:30.970
as long as you show heart,
it's all about heart and Thailand.
Uh,

731
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.150
true with a lot of Asian countries,
right?
That's the same as Japan,

732
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.931
the Samurai spirit.

733
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:38.260
If you go out there and give it your all and you go out in a stretcher that they

734
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:41.380
prefer,
you go out in a stretcher,
then you lay down and borrow from a knees.
Oh,

735
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:43.420
it hurts.
But that's one of the,

736
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.820
one of the major complaints from a lot of fighters,

737
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:48.000
like rampage said that many times about,
ah,

738
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.760
the different stream fighting in Japan and fighting in America as an in Japan,

739
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.520
they appreciate effort.
They want you to fight your best.

740
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:55.540
And if you fight your best,

741
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:57.550
sometimes you fight someone who's better than you and you lose.

742
00:40:57.551 --> 00:40:59.920
And that's just the way of fighting.
And it's a way of learning.

743
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.360
And that's how guys get better at that,

744
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.050
that adversity from loss and going back and regrouping and watching films and,

745
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:10.150
and realizing where you have to step your game up.
That's what creates champions.

746
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:10.511
I mean,

747
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:15.130
that is what creates a real champion is you have to be able to fight people who

748
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:17.360
are better than you are as good as you,
or it's,

749
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.030
it's gotta be a really high level that you're aspiring to.
And along the way,

750
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:23.710
sometimes you lose.
But in Japan,

751
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.710
they treat the losers in those like really high level fights,
words,

752
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.490
just incredible action heart.

753
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:33.040
And does they treat the losers the same way they treat the winners?

754
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.010
That doesn't happen

755
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 2>in America.
In America.</v>

756
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:38.150
That's the number one complaint is that people look at you like,
Oh,

757
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:42.530
you're a loser.
You lost you loser.
I find,
I find,
um,

758
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.270
well my toy and in MMA we'll UFC especially,
um,

759
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:51.380
the crowd I think is a lot better than boxing.
If you have one loss in boxing,

760
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:56.030
you're done.
You can have it.
You can be 26 and I,
24 knockouts,

761
00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.530
one loss are,
he's has been his issue,
retire,
he's done.
And then,
uh,
you have,

762
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.680
if you have two losses in boxing od you then talk about it anymore.

763
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:06.610
You're out of the,
and especially Kale losses,
Carlos's,

764
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.400
but in a MMA or in a motel,
I especially,
um,

765
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.940
if long as you fight hard and you lose to a guy,
a good guy and your crowd,

766
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:15.930
p Bass is still going to be there next time around,

767
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.100
you're not going to lose anybody long as you fight hard and if you get knocked

768
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.530
out going out in your shield,
they're still going to be a next time.

769
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.780
There's still support.
Yeah.
Well,
there's a few fighters.

770
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:26.150
It's still have that kind of support just because they're so excited and like

771
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:27.830
Vandelay Silva is a perfect example.

772
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.440
Like vandelays been knocked out quite a few times,

773
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:33.890
but he still has a gigantic following because there's not,

774
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:38.360
there's no such thing as a boring Vandelay Silva fight every Vandelay Silva

775
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:42.640
fight.
It's like,
ready,
ready?
Chaos.
Yes.
You know,
are you ready?
Are you ready?

776
00:42:42.641 --> 00:42:46.790
Are you fucking mad violence until that guy's last heartbeat.

777
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.550
You mean every time he fights he fights like a man possessed,

778
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.930
which is why he has so many people that love him.
But a lot of guys,

779
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.920
they felt like,
like Quentin rampage especially,
I hate to keep bringing him up,

780
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:02.390
but he experienced a lot of hate after,
you know,
after beating chocolate del,

781
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.560
you know,
and,
and he was like,

782
00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:06.570
I can't believe people were upset at me for being good,
you know,

783
00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.640
cause I beat their hero.

784
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.770
You'd hear all these people would say horrible shit to them.

785
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:14.280
And I think in that sense the United States crowds,
like there's,

786
00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:17.750
there's something to be desired about some of the people that are excited about

787
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:20.810
fighting MMA crowd.
I noticed with,
with George,

788
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:23.090
especially hanging with George and he,
when we were trying to get,

789
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:25.090
they put a few photos up and then I was more,

790
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:30.340
I go at each page and always astonished by the amount of hate that George has on

791
00:43:30.951 --> 00:43:31.371
his page.

792
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:35.600
He has like 4 million people that follow him and he's Twitter and then all it is

793
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:39.460
when you're going to finish it Vij George or if I need to get asleep,

794
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.530
I just put a judge named Pierre fight or not was a puffer is through the first

795
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:44.600
round.
And it's like,
fuck man.
He says,

796
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:46.310
this is one of the greatest fighters of all time.

797
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.600
How can you not appreciate him dominating some of the Veyron?
What is,

798
00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:51.320
you have to know cat someone every single time he fought.

799
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.470
It's fully doesn't look at everybody and he's the highest paid athlete in the

800
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:59.010
world.
Why can't the same be for MMA guys?
Why if someone dominate someone black,

801
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:01.580
can you appreciate his skills instead of,
oh,
it has to be an okay.

802
00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:03.260
It has to be in Nakia.
Oh,
believe me.

803
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:06.710
If you go and watch Floyd and see him interact with the public,

804
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.620
that guy gets fucked with as much as anybody.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.

805
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.140
They showed it on his,
uh,
the 24,
seven,
like one of his last,
uh,

806
00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:18.020
those HBO things for 24,
seven.
Like when he was out at a burger place,

807
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:19.390
people were heckling them.
Oh,

808
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.640
you're heckling him at a cheeseburger place because the camera's on in,
in his,

809
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.520
in front of us because he's a little guy and it's like it right in front of his

810
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:26.600
face.
They were fucking with him.

811
00:44:26.601 --> 00:44:30.740
Didn't he get punched by Toa somewhat supposedly punched him.
You know,

812
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.960
I have a hard time believing

813
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.540
<v 1>some stupid fucking rappers.
Gonna Punch Floyd Mayweather,
you know?
And if he did,</v>

814
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.620
he knew that other people were there,
you know,
put those.
Yeah.
Okay.

815
00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:42.210
You want to hit him?
Okay.
How about we do this?

816
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:44.670
How about we lock the two of you in a conference room?
It just,

817
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:47.280
let's just shut the door and see what the fuck's going on without your buddies

818
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:52.281
in the room getting punched by a rat match and the dignity thing.

819
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.130
One of the greatest,
if not the greatest boxer of all time.

820
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:59.040
A lot of people give that Guy Shit and say he's not the greatest it.

821
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:00.360
Sugar Ray Robinson is a greatest,

822
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.570
like I had this conversation with Max Kellerman about,
about it.

823
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.590
I respect Max Kellerman very much,
but I don't think that,

824
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.910
I don't think that Floyd Mayweather would've lost the Jake lamata would've been

825
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:16.770
Hula Chavez,
who's amazing and it's time 9,797 a night before his first list,

826
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.350
but Meldrick Taylor was beaten him until he got tagged.

827
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:23.010
And I don't think Meldrick Taylor is the same boxer that Floyd Mayweather is.

828
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:25.560
I think Floyd Mayweather defensively is the best ever.

829
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.370
We've seen him get hit like three times and his whole career,
you know my,

830
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:31.650
Donna cracked him in the last fight,
buddy.

831
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:34.080
He only cracked him in like at the end of the round.

832
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.360
And you could see like he got rocked in that fight.

833
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:41.310
He got rocked by Shane Mosley,
but he's just,
he's so good defensively.
So good.

834
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.080
Yup.
That he just never really experienced as much danger in his fights,

835
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.190
you know?
I mean,

836
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:51.600
you go back to all the other greats and they were in wars.

837
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.900
He's never in a war.
Yeah.
She says never in a war.

838
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.590
And you could talk all the shit you want,
but look at the guys he's fighting.

839
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.720
You know,
he's fighting Juan Manwell Marquez.

840
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.470
Look what happened with [inaudible] Marquez and Pacquiao.
Yeah.
I mean,

841
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:08.090
they're in a war and mark has caught them and knock them out dead.
You know,

842
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.670
full full was good luck trying to catch Floyd like that.
Good luck.
Yup.

843
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.850
He's just never going to make those kinds of mistakes.

844
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.480
And one of the things that's so exciting about Pacquiao is that he throws

845
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:19.530
himself into danger.

846
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.220
He puts him in be so aggressive and he's so fast and he's willing to,

847
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:24.750
he tries to finish fights.

848
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:29.070
He tries to put himself in the line of fire in order to achieve victory flowing

849
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:32.290
doesn't do that.
Should Floyd shoulder roll in and,
and,

850
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.400
and popping you at jabs and moving on you and you just get,

851
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.330
you see guys like Canelo Alvarez just look so flustered.

852
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:41.380
Like they don't know what to do with them.
Yeah.
Let him go.
He's,

853
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.970
they're giving up halfway through the third round.
First round,

854
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:46.800
the first round they're like,
oh,
I'm going to make a statement today,

855
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.900
which this no one's going to be able to do what I'm going to do.

856
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.380
And then by the third round they just come out like beginners and then they're

857
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:55.050
too afraid the fray,
because Joe Floyd's already a step ahead of him.

858
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.550
If he had strong hands,
if his hands didn't break all the time.
You know,

859
00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:02.160
like Floyd,
he's had quite a few like broken hands.

860
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:06.150
He's a serious problem with the handbrakes.
If he didn't have that man,

861
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.270
God damn you know,
if he had punching power as well,

862
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:13.350
is that insane defensive technique?
Yep.
He's,
in my opinion,

863
00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:15.990
he's the most masterful of all the boxers I've ever watched.

864
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.720
Bernard Hopkins right up there on rewards is another one.

865
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:19.770
He doesn't get enough credit.

866
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.170
It was like a lot of Americans or for whatever reason,

867
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:26.160
are not aware of how good Andre Ward is,
but God damn,
he's a good boxer.

868
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.640
Another one just brilliant defensively.
Very rarely see him in trouble.

869
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.920
And he's so different too because Andre Ward fights different styles for

870
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:38.770
different fighters.
Like some fighters,
he'll fight on the outside,

871
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:41.920
he'll fight long range and he'll fight.
He'll,
he'll box them.

872
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.390
And then on other other fighters,

873
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:46.750
he just fucking gets right up in your grill and he's throwing these combinations

874
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:50.680
and cutting angles on you and never let you breathe.
He's very versatile.

875
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.410
Very smart too,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

876
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:57.130
I missed the nineties I missed the books in the 90s the Oscar de la Hoya is the

877
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:01.080
Shane Mosley's.
They back in them days are men for men.
It was,
it was fun.
Yeah,

878
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:05.890
it was crazy.
They do it now.
I don't want to fight you because you might beat me.

879
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.760
Oh zero that might disappear if you beat me.
So I didn't want that happening.

880
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.230
Do you think of guy like Floyd man with her,

881
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:14.260
cause he's 47 to know that it contributes to that because he makes so much

882
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:16.870
fucking money.
Him being 47 and Amin that guy,

883
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.880
the money team and rolls around and Rolls Royce that drive you crazy because

884
00:48:20.881 --> 00:48:21.790
you'd taken,
yeah.

885
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.570
Why hasn't taken it so long for Mr [inaudible] get this flight to be done in

886
00:48:25.571 --> 00:48:29.110
these five five five year old fight?
They should have been done ages ago.

887
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.030
Well probably because Floyd is smart,

888
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.910
which is why he's 47 now and he wants to fight him when he knows he beat him and

889
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.250
a tree and $120 million.
I mean that's what's up.
I mean,

890
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.250
what's up at the end of the day?
Look,
if they fought in their primes,

891
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:45.670
and I'm not saying pack out,
let's be real about this.

892
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.380
Let's be totally real about this pack.

893
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:52.930
I'll went up eight weight classes and retained his punching power and there was

894
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.960
always all sorts of allegations of special proteins that came and needle forum,

895
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.630
Mexican supplements if you were,
I don't know what the fuck was going on,

896
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.160
but that's one of the things that Floyd oh ways was saying and a lot of other

897
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:11.800
fighters who said it to,
I don't know if it's true,

898
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.100
but if it is true and Floyd wasn't doing those same things and they did fight

899
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:21.790
and Pacbio did have that unnatural advantage,
you know,
a few years ago,

900
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.340
like back when he fought Margarito or you know,

901
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:25.960
back before mark has knocked him out.

902
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:31.000
You gotta wonder like maybe it's intelligent to not fight a guy like that at

903
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:31.630
that time.

904
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.650
If you know something that you and I and the regular people that aren't involved

905
00:49:35.651 --> 00:49:40.120
in the deep,
deep in the boxing world,
maybe smart might be smart.
Just,
you know,

906
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:44.050
nobody wants to see a guy cheat his way to victory.
That's like,

907
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.790
that's something that drives everyone crazy and just no doubt about it.

908
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.260
There's no doubt in the fact that pat gala works hard.
I mean,
Patios,

909
00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:56.380
I was disciplined.
He's focused,
he's amazing fighter.
I mean,
no doubt about it.

910
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:57.550
But man,

911
00:49:57.551 --> 00:50:01.330
there's a lot of fucking allegations connected to his camp that Alex Mariza guy

912
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:05.560
that got it left and uh,
and was,
uh,
who the fuck was he training with?

913
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:08.590
He was training with one of,
uh,
one of Pascal's opponents.

914
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.210
I forgot which fight it was,

915
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.720
but that guy has gotten a lot of weird shit attached to them.

916
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:16.900
There's a lot of these guys that have a lot of weird allegations that may or may

917
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:20.290
not be true,
but if you're smart and you're a guy like Floyd Mayweather,

918
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.360
why not avoid those guys?

919
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.570
And that's something that we were talking about earlier today,
because George,
um,

920
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.130
when he was talking

921
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.530
<v 2>about when he left the UFC and when he said,</v>

922
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:32.840
I'm going to take a break and I'm going to relinquish my title,

923
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:37.360
one of the things that he talked about was the problem with pds.
Yep.
We talked,

924
00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:37.731
he said it,

925
00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:42.410
this is a huge problem in MMA and a lot of people poo pooed and we don't need to

926
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:47.090
name names.
A lot of people said that,
oh,
he's exaggerating,
but now,
man,

927
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.110
it's now with these more stringent tests that are being performed.

928
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.110
Fucking Anderson Silva pisses hot.
Yes.

929
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:58.610
I mean everybody like Hector Lombard,
who saw that coming,
who's hot?
I didn't,

930
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.610
I can't believe Hector Lombard.
That doesn't make any sense.

931
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:06.020
He doesn't look like a guy who was on supplements,
but you know,
it's,
it's a part,

932
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.980
it's a part of the sport.
It's very unfortunate.
Uh,
in Thailand,
uh,

933
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.180
if we wanted a pick me up,

934
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:14.600
the only thing that we would get from the chemist with his Jenson Jenson,

935
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:19.310
I'd go down and I get 20 genes and in for 20 days.
And,
uh,

936
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.110
that was l and even then for 20 days and they cut you off after 20 days,

937
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.970
let's not get crazy.
I learned,
I laid a small budget.

938
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.880
I'd have to wait for my next flight to get prize money to buy another 25
minutes.

939
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:33.890
Flight came.
How much does Jensen costs on their eyes?
20 bottles.
A template.

940
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:38.790
What does a Bot in American money,
50 cents,
50 cents maybe,

941
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.870
maybe.
Hey box for 20 Ginseng tablets.
I was pool.

942
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.590
I was only making $30 a fight back then.
Jeez,
fuck.

943
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.680
And then I'd have to get 50% of that to the camp too.

944
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:53.710
So you will make what is the cheapest you've ever made for a $30?

945
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.150
$30 and now it's fighting,
um,

946
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.340
ties with a hundred fights and you had to give how much back?
50%.

947
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.460
So the deal with my camp was,
it was,
um,

948
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:06.461
I live for free train for free in eight train and leave.

949
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:08.240
And then every time I fought,

950
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.770
I give 50% to the camp and then say if I made 1000 bucks,
500,

951
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.910
if my 10,000 baht is 5,000 and then I was lucky enough to go to me and bought,

952
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:21.680
say they don't have to get the camp 500,000 baht.
And that was like,
oh my God,

953
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:24.230
that's like four lots homes of prize money.
Right?

954
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.710
They're saying a million baht would be how much American money?
Uh,

955
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.110
it was 35,000 Australian.
So I bet $10 a strain.

956
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.000
I tend to those American,
no,
what is a million?

957
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.620
I think uh,
the Australian dollar's been equivalent to a peso.

958
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.080
I don't know what that's about.
35,000.

959
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:50.140
So a million baht is $35,000.
Probably about 35.
No.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.

960
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.490
That was the most he made there.
That's insane.

961
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:56.750
You wonder why you're angry at Floyd Mayweather.
And then I had to give,

962
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.650
I had to get 50% of the camp to 17,000.

963
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.040
At least you're living for free entry.
But sometimes I wouldn't,

964
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:06.140
wouldn't fight for ages too.
So I needed the,

965
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:08.480
and then eating for free and had some way to the roof over my head.

966
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.970
I want to talk to you about your journey because as a young man,
as a teenager,

967
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:16.280
you chose to move to Thailand.

968
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:21.340
You didn't know the language and you immerse yourself in Thai culture and became

969
00:53:21.861 --> 00:53:25.980
a tie fighter.
I mean,
not as an incredible adventure for a

970
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.480
<v 3>young man to take part of in a very rare and brave one that not a lot of people</v>

971
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.360
ever didn't,
none of them.

972
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.280
The people really stick their neck out like that and do something along those

973
00:53:35.281 --> 00:53:38.640
lines.
Um,
the movie keep books that came out of the van dam and it's like,

974
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:41.490
I want to,
I want to walk in this guy's footsteps.
I want to be this guy.

975
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.790
So I had 13 fights in Australia when I'm an Australian toilets.

976
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:46.650
Happiest if your total.

977
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.240
And then I had a relationship with a guy called Richard Bell who was an orange,

978
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:54.300
a Thai restaurant,
and he said,
you fought amazing tonight.
Uh,
I want,

979
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.120
I want to know,
do you want to go to Thailand and learn from the best?
I said,

980
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:59.070
I'd love to lymph in the best.
I'd be amazing.
He said,

981
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:01.710
if you can organize your passport,
I'll do everything else.

982
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.930
I'll do your plane ticket.
I'll find you a cam.
I'll train,

983
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.310
uh oh two when you go to passport.
And then sure enough,

984
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.480
he bought me a plane ticket and he said,

985
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.570
you must promise me you can't come back for six months.
Um,

986
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.780
if you come back before then me and you had done,
done and dusted.
Wow.

987
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:18.430
So you got to promise me you're stays.
Okay.
I stay in.
So I went to the,

988
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.200
I went to Thailand,
um,
moved to Bangkok.
I know could speak English.

989
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.620
I had the one of those ones where there's a hole in the ground and you had to

990
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:29.760
pull in the,
uh,
in the little sheet on the,
and then there's no toilet paper.

991
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:34.350
I say the poor water in your hand to wipe your bum.
Uh,
yeah.
You had no hot water.

992
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:37.440
So we had the rinse on,
soap up and then rinse off.

993
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.310
It's hilarious that that is what you would complain about when people are

994
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.310
kicking you in the foot,
legs,
body and head all day.

995
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.730
You got to wipe your ass weird.
And then,
and then sleep,

996
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.270
sleep on a wooden floor and it's 10 other dudes.
And then there's no,

997
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:52.650
you're from their beds and then,

998
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.500
and that's not including the 70 hours of training and Thai boxing too.

999
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:57.060
So when you're finished your year,

1000
00:54:57.061 --> 00:55:01.050
three and a half hours and at night you got a wooden Florida look forward to,

1001
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:04.830
to go to bed on.
Wow.
No cushion at all.
I put a,
uh,

1002
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.400
like a big blanket down as a,
like a bit of cushion in between that and the,

1003
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.300
the wood,
how much snoring was involved.
The worst one was the arms and legs.

1004
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:14.520
The ties would throw an arm over here in the middle of the night and you have

1005
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:17.370
this one and get it off in case it took advantage of you.

1006
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.940
And then,
um,
yeah,
so I had firefights four,
five wins,

1007
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.320
four knockouts came back to Australia and then the Thai can't reign my sponsor.

1008
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:30.300
And I said,
hey,
he looks like he's got a bit of promise.

1009
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:32.850
Can you send him back again?
So my,
he rang me up and said,

1010
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.320
you want to go back to the toilet?
And I said,

1011
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.150
I'd love to get back to the time that I didn't want to work.

1012
00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.850
I want to live this type books in dream.
So I said,
okay,

1013
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:42.450
this time you got to promise me 12 months,
don't come back within 12 months.

1014
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:47.320
You've got to commit your whole life.
So sure.
So I went over and then,
uh,

1015
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.230
I was fighting them,
the little shows back then,

1016
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:52.650
and then the opportunity to the main guy that was at our camp Sanken he was

1017
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:55.710
falling on a big show.
And then,
uh,
I went to support him.

1018
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.930
And then a guy called Danny bill from France,

1019
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:00.480
he was supposed to fight one of the big tires and he didn't,
he never rocked up.

1020
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.430
And he did the,
he disappeared something.
And I said,
oh,

1021
00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:05.610
I wouldn't get any bills right here.
Who's going to fight this guy?

1022
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:08.250
Am My trying to put his hand up and said,
this guy will,
you're fighting.

1023
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.540
And I've absolutely poop my pants.
I shit myself.
And uh,

1024
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.610
how many fights did you have at this point?
Uh,
13,
14,
uh,

1025
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.630
about 16.
And he said he'll fight him.
He'll,
these guys had like 250 fights.

1026
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:24.640
And Mike,
my young teenager here fired him.
And then,
uh,

1027
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.520
he said he can't fight him.
Him fight though.

1028
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.820
And does anyone in the room when I fight the white guy and I kid you not about

1029
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:33.360
60 hands went up in the room and I said,
well off fighting,
more fighting.

1030
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.340
And so they said,
are you two?
You're the close.

1031
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.320
So I ended up fighting this guy in front of,
um,

1032
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.640
40,000 people and got cut in the fifth bloodstream and in my face and that I'm

1033
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:43.960
doing half the,
beat him every round.

1034
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.740
And then I'm the number one promoter and Thailand,
Thailand said,
okay,

1035
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:50.110
done from near one,
you're going to start fighting for me.

1036
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.630
And then I nixed me and I'm sad and find a 60,000,
um,

1037
00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.690
side of the final and Pini Stadium.

1038
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:58.900
I'm fighting on TV or all the fights I make and the first western.

1039
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:02.290
And to make the,
the number one selling my time magazine in Thailand.

1040
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.190
I'm sat in there,
all the toys that are calling me,
the dangerous kangaroo.

1041
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.190
And then the air then started reaching the a class guys,
which was a bit,

1042
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.260
a bit of a shock,
uh,
afforded.

1043
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:18.490
I called Orono and I'd had 20 fights and he had like close to 300,

1044
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.800
and he was like the household name.
He was the Anderson Silva,

1045
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:25.810
almost [inaudible] in Thailand.
And then a third round,

1046
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:29.020
he cut me 21 stitches,
the flight gets stopped.
Um,

1047
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:32.650
so I went down a few pegs and then from then on and backwards and forwards,

1048
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:36.090
backwards and forwards.
And then,
uh,
the year 2000,
I got to,

1049
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.990
to rematch the Orono again.

1050
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.950
And this time was on the king's birthday in front of 100,000 people live on TV.

1051
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.460
And then I scored him,
uh,
every round and when he's walled,
huddle in front of a,

1052
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.240
all these ties.
And then from that moment on,

1053
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:53.050
all of a sudden I started becoming a sort of a celebrity and toilet,

1054
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:57.670
not a celebrity,
but in the Moitai Ward.
I was somebody near.
Wow.

1055
00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:00.010
That's amazing.
And then from there I come back to Australia,

1056
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:02.260
opened the gym and then uh,

1057
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.190
I had no trainer and then so all I've got a few of my friends even to this day I

1058
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:07.780
get my friends,
Hey,
can you hold the pedal like this?

1059
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:10.780
I watched the fight that the provider ring.
Hey,
do you want to fight this guy?

1060
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.470
Okay.
So I'll tell my friend,
hey,
can you hold the pads like this?
And then um,

1061
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.281
then I'll go and fight.
Hey,

1062
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:17.590
do you want to come to give me some water in between rounds?

1063
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.840
So when you were training in Australia self-trained self train to the Sam's to

1064
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:26.800
self trained to this day.
Yeah.
But your,
your time in Thai,

1065
00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:30.850
in Thailand you are training with the best just so the toys,
they said okay,

1066
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.710
you pretty much have to been here for five years.

1067
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:36.730
You pretty much Noel system now all you have to do is get fit and then I'll come

1068
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:39.100
back to Australia and so I've been doing and just help them get my friends to

1069
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:39.880
help me.

1070
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.080
Do you feel like there's anything that you miss when you do that as opposed to

1071
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:48.550
like training in Thailand?
Like with those guys?
Like if you had your druthers,

1072
00:58:48.551 --> 00:58:49.570
like if you had a choice,

1073
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.440
would you have like a worldclass tar trainer come and train with you in

1074
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:57.850
Australia?
Yes.
Yes,
yes.
But at the same time it's been working.

1075
00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.090
What I've been doing is working,
I've,

1076
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.350
I've of being quite good assist for the last 15 years,

1077
00:59:02.351 --> 00:59:04.360
but doing it by myself and it's like middleman.
Eva,

1078
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:07.900
how don't have to worry about a manager or someone telling me what to do.

1079
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:12.490
And I'm s um,
I pushed myself in my training to a high standard where,
um,

1080
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:13.893
uh,

1081
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:18.370
I guess doing okay cause I won another eight world titles doing it by myself

1082
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:20.740
against it now after I've been lucky enough to travel the world too.

1083
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.310
I'm gone all over Europe

1084
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.430
<v 2>and you're fighting in Japan 16 times and um,
yeah,</v>

1085
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:29.000
beaten everybody in Australia already set for my last one but um,

1086
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.310
ba and that's been good.
I like it.
You fought some legends to man.
I mean your,

1087
00:59:33.311 --> 00:59:35.970
your,
your record.
If you look at all the,

1088
00:59:35.971 --> 00:59:39.430
the names like the legends of [inaudible],
you fought quite a few of them man.

1089
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:44.180
Yeah,
it's been cool.
I have the,
Oh and um,
like you were saying before to,
to,

1090
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.880
to be that there would get famous,
you've got to fight the famous guys.

1091
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:49.040
I don't want to be one of these ones are like,
uh,

1092
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:54.020
I'm not afraid to step up and if I lose to him,
at least I had a car I tried.

1093
00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.140
But majority of Tom I'm winning.
It's like,
yeah,
I can't believe I beat that guy.

1094
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.070
I shit myself for the last six weeks getting ready for you and I have one.

1095
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.810
So how good's this is awesome.
Say Yeah.

1096
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.200
And then sometimes I'll match myself as well with someone.
Like,

1097
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.670
it's like the crowd is going on,
why are you fighting this guy?
You like your old,

1098
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:14.180
this guy is going to wipe the four and then I win again.
It's like,

1099
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.770
it's just a such as self satisfying feeling to know that um,

1100
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.280
I can still compete with the elite.

1101
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.410
Do people give you a hard time because you're old?

1102
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:23.460
Because when you're not that old,
you're younger than me.

1103
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.600
38 but 38 in combat sports is,
yeah,
it's definitely,

1104
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.330
but I've been getting told off.
I've been always since I was 27,

1105
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:31.520
28 even though I was in the k one that was,

1106
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.820
I was the old guy then being 28 years old,
28 years old and Yay.

1107
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.000
Yay going.
Well,
when are you going to give it up?
And then
it's one of those ones.

1108
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:45.230
I want to ride it to the last wave until once you did.
You did.

1109
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.670
And I don't want to regret not doing what I'm doing and just hold in peds.

1110
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:54.140
I'd rather be in the limelight and still trying to reach that pinnacle there

1111
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.820
than the Mount Everest of fighting.

1112
01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:00.020
So how many more years do you think you can do it at 38 years old?

1113
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:03.500
Do you have a number in your head or do you just do it while your body is

1114
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:07.530
healthy and why you enjoy?
Why I just want to keep going.
Um,
uh,

1115
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.280
been a Hopkins is 50.
He was supposed to retire when he was 40.

1116
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:13.340
He promised his mom and he was going to give it up when he's 40 and he's lasted

1117
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:15.860
another 10 years and he's still fighting the elite and still winning world

1118
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:18.720
titles and his mom die.
Yeah.

1119
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.760
Some guys like that,
you know?
Well,
I promised them

1120
01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.240
even here anymore.
I don't know.
He's,
he's so good defensively.
You know,

1121
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.270
he's another one.
He's a killer.
He's,
he's a great bio.
It was amazing.

1122
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:38.090
He was willing to fight Calvillo at this stage of his life at 49 years,

1123
01:01:38.091 --> 01:01:39.710
eight of age fights.

1124
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:44.000
One of the best knockout artists like in the last decade in that division.

1125
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.550
Yeah.
It's a crazy,
it's I'm skills.
Yeah.
It's just skills.
Having skills,
you know,

1126
01:01:49.551 --> 01:01:53.870
having the ability to know what to do in any given time.
Step.

1127
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:57.650
Nowhere step.
No,
no.
What's coming,
you know,
and like we were saying no,

1128
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:00.470
that language,
he knows the language of boxing so well.

1129
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.400
And you don't get famous holding peds.
He didn't get famous writing.

1130
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.700
Cool Facebook posts.
I try,
but it doesn't happen.

1131
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.900
That's repeating that you've repeated that many times.

1132
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:14.240
Like they're getting famous.
Yeah.
Getting famous.
That's a,

1133
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.410
that's a big part of what,
what motivates you right.

1134
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.190
Since was about

1135
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.730
<v 3>five or six years old.
Um,</v>

1136
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:27.120
every time I look into the sky and see a single star and I wish I can be

1137
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:30.240
remembered,
uh,
when I blow my birthday candles out,

1138
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.450
I wish that I can my legacy.
Once I die,

1139
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.550
I can be that guy that people go,
Yup.
My Empire.
Wow.
That's interesting man.

1140
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:43.290
That's um,
that's a weird drive for a young man to have.
What do you,

1141
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:47.930
what do you attribute that to?
Like to want to want to be remembered?
Yeah.
Muscle.

1142
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:52.230
My whole life.
That's my only goal.
Winning a world title was always,

1143
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.550
I didn't want to win a world title.

1144
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:57.090
I wanted to win a world title and Tyleen against the tie against a genuine,

1145
01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:59.100
I don't want to win against someone down the road.

1146
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.890
I always wanted the take it to that next level.

1147
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:04.440
And then once I did win the world title and that went into and Bangkok,

1148
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:09.260
but now it's about the legacy news about the,
the,
the,

1149
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:13.770
yeah,
like any human being.
Once you pass your yes,
turn into flowers.

1150
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:19.600
And I want to be,
I wanted people like Dick,
like the remainder respected.

1151
01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.900
I show him after he's passed away for the last couple of years,

1152
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.610
I want people to look with me in exactly the same light.

1153
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.480
Hopefully one day he died of a heart attack while riding a bike.
Right?
Yeah.

1154
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.930
In the park by himself.
No,
we would know when to give him any CPI.
Just pass away.

1155
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.810
That's so crazy.
Do they know what was wrong with them?

1156
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.180
I mean it doesn't even make sense.
Yeah.
Who knows.

1157
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.410
I'm 42 years old and then I'm going to push mark is crazy.

1158
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:47.280
You were talking to me earlier about the injuries that he had suffered,
that he,

1159
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:51.360
he had his foot fused to his ankle.
Yes.
Yes.
He's broken.

1160
01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.570
He's like that many times.
This is what I've seen from the documentary.

1161
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.440
I could be wrong.
Um,

1162
01:03:55.441 --> 01:03:59.310
I'm sure Beth would have a better understanding of being Dutch.
But um,
yeah.
From,

1163
01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:03.460
from the,
the stories that he told me,
his leg was,
uh,
going to amputate it.

1164
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.180
It was got to the stage where he said,
well,
what else can we do?
Oh,

1165
01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:10.110
we can fuse your ankle to your Shin.
So he used to say,
I used to just do peds.

1166
01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:12.720
I wouldn't spa and just save it to the fight.
And then if it broke,
it broke.

1167
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.310
But I just changed the Southport and then hopefully not use it.
And,

1168
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:19.440
but then he was so adamant that I had the,

1169
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:21.560
when he just go back to Orthodox and just start using it anyway,

1170
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.220
it's just that crazy mentality because it kept breaking it.

1171
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.980
If he kept breaking it,
they were going to have to amputate it.
Yeah,
that's what,

1172
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:32.910
that's what the documentary said anyway.
He's still kicking it.
Yeah.
So nuts.

1173
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.140
I remember when he fought and Duane Ludwig and the,
his last fight,
and Kaitlin,

1174
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:40.010
uh,
we're,
we call an elevator together and I said,
hey,

1175
01:04:40.011 --> 01:04:41.670
you're feeling we has it all go and you feel good.

1176
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.200
And he showed me his arm and his arm was black from his wrist to his shoulder.

1177
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:51.360
And he said,
I've pulled my bicep.
I can't punch.
Right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I win.

1178
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.223
No problem.

1179
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:57.120
And sure enough he dropped the Duane Ludwig three or four times.

1180
01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:00.240
I don't know if it was 1.2 by knockout,
but he won by points.

1181
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.220
But the points we want to,
yeah,
that's incredible.
And that's just,

1182
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:09.000
that's him.
That's,
and then you see something like that and you think,
ah,

1183
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.740
I want to be that guy.
It's,

1184
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:15.510
I'm so torn on that because on one hand I admire mental toughness.

1185
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.160
I mean obviously,
I mean that's just the ability to block that

1186
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.490
<v 2>out and say it's okay,
I'll wing no problem.
I mean that's incredible.</v>

1187
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:22.390
But in the other hand,

1188
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:26.870
he's an example of what happens when you are really mentally tough as is.

1189
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.360
His legs were shot,
his ankles were fucked up,
his body was falling apart.

1190
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.490
It's like you red line your body.
Cause that's how he fought.
He fought red line.

1191
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:41.650
I mean,
if you've never seen Ramon Dekkers fight,
if you,
someone who is,
uh,
you're,

1192
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:46.480
you're not aware of Moy Tai,
just to yourself a favor and Google Ramon decker,

1193
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.501
I mean a lot.

1194
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:51.880
There's a lot of people that folks will talk up and you know,

1195
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.670
you watch it and it's like,
well they kind of exaggerate it.

1196
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.790
You can't do that guy justice.
You can't do him justice.

1197
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.160
He got to watch how violently he fought.

1198
01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Just it was so hyper aggressive and vicious knockout power,

1199
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:10.270
beautiful combinations and everything he threw was 100%.

1200
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.020
Everything he threw,
there was no set ups.
Everything was fine.

1201
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.410
It was just so exciting to watch man and but look,

1202
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:20.470
his body just eventually just deteriorated and fell apart.

1203
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.770
And the ways where is the line lane ways he did it at the legacy show pass the

1204
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.470
longevity.
Say he'll never be forgotten.

1205
01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:34.060
Full hell tenacious and how crazy and how violent he was.
So that's what I want.

1206
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.800
I want to go until I can't go anymore.
And then if I pass,

1207
01:06:36.801 --> 01:06:37.660
I wanted to be a member for that.

1208
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.590
Glad that it seems interesting that it's as Saundra.

1209
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:45.630
Maybe only the only way to be great is to kind of like break your body trying to

1210
01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:49.630
be great.
It seems like,
like look at Cain Velasquez.

1211
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.690
He can't get through a training camp.
I mean he's,

1212
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.430
he's fought two times I think in the last few years and it's because everything

1213
01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.290
keeps breaking.
His knee keeps fucking up,

1214
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:03.520
his shoulders keep fucking up and it's because he's so mentally tough is because

1215
01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:07.210
any injury that,
that guy has just goes in the back of his brain and it's just,

1216
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:12.130
Paul is a champion.
It's just juggernaut press forward,
you know,
attack,

1217
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:13.240
attack,
attack,
attack.

1218
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:17.080
And these guys that have that ability to ignore Chris Weidman is another one.

1219
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.980
He just keeps him injuring himself.
He's had knee surgery,

1220
01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:24.520
he just fucked up his ribs.
How many crews get Dominick Cruz?
Another one.

1221
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.110
It's like they're there.
This is,

1222
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:31.111
this drive to attack and succeed oftentimes forces their body to just like the

1223
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.170
body says,
listen dude,
you're at,
you're being crazy here.

1224
01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:37.480
You can't keep doing this.
We're just going to check out.

1225
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.420
How about we give you a little knee injury here and take,
take six months off.

1226
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:45.140
You know,
it's like the adrenaline drug getting in front of that crowd.
Of the,

1227
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.750
the 5,000,
10,000,
20,000.
You can buy it.

1228
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:53.320
I've tried.
He just came like,
but anyway.

1229
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:58.530
Do you worry about like being in it past your prime or do you think that you'll

1230
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.530
know when it's time to stop?
Uh,

1231
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.790
I retired three years ago digit and then I thought,

1232
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.890
I thought I'll go in and talk.
I've had,

1233
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.840
I was on a five or six fight winning streak,
um,
at,

1234
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.100
but then in six months it was driving me just that,
not

1235
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.080
<v 3>being that the famous guy anymore.
We've not been in the magazines,</v>

1236
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:23.900
not being on TV,
not people coming up and not giving that recognition anymore.

1237
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:28.430
And then I came back and I went on another fire fight winning streak and I,

1238
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:32.430
it was so good to be back amongst the minx and to,
to the,

1239
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.910
the being in front of that crowd again.
Um,

1240
01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.940
I understand why people can't give it up and they keep coming back out of

1241
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:42.020
retirement because it is the most exciting thing that you could possibly do on

1242
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:47.021
earth is the stand in front of someone and try and knock each other out when

1243
01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:50.310
you're done.
Do you think that you will become a trainer?
I mean do,

1244
01:08:50.311 --> 01:08:52.060
you can have it.

1245
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.730
I've got my gym for the last 15 years and then I've been lucky enough to tour

1246
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.270
the world doing seminars and teaching,
which I get a kick out of,
but yeah,

1247
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:02.240
it's not fighting.
It's not,
it's not.
It's not punching on.

1248
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:05.970
Do you ever think you would run a gym in Thailand?
No.
No.

1249
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.290
That'd be a disrespect to the ties.
The ties are so good and to have a western,

1250
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:12.770
that could be a disrespect,
I believe.
Sorry.
Even calling myself crew,

1251
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:17.290
I cringe when people call me a crew.
Really?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

1252
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.050
Because I'm not a tie and I don't deserve the honor of being called a crew.

1253
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:21.884
I'm them.
I'm,

1254
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:26.030
I'm a a white guy trying to be the best possible version of a type person.

1255
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:30.590
That's very interesting because Americans used that that term all the time.

1256
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:34.160
Like crew Mark Della [inaudible] is a good example is my friend Mark Telegraph.

1257
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.740
And then so many people that I've met,

1258
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.200
I don't respect and I someone call someone,
a crude Oklahoma crew crew,

1259
01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:46.040
mark or crew are going to cover my tais.
Shut up.
Now
Rhino,

1260
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.840
what does crew Rhino mean?
Take courage teacher.
I know what that means,

1261
01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:55.590
but why is it so crew,
Roz is my fight name.
Oh,
how dare you lecture.

1262
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.430
Just put my jacket on that
Eh,

1263
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:04.960
but um,
so the,
the term crew is like a deep,

1264
01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.820
deep respect.
Um,
I've spent five years here.
I've,
I've been a monk of,

1265
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:13.500
I've done my whole business of you've been a monk?
Yeah,

1266
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.770
I was a monk for seven days.
I went to twice a long time.
Lived in,
lived in,
um,

1267
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.110
every,
every time.
It all has to be a monk once in their life.
So even if it's,

1268
01:10:21.111 --> 01:10:24.140
if it's seven days,
you're still a monk.
Really?
Every tie.
What?

1269
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.860
Every time mail has to be a more time male.
Yes.

1270
01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:32.330
You have to be a monk for,
for how long can get open seven days a month,

1271
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:36.230
three months,
six months,
one year,
two years.
But whatever you commit to,

1272
01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:39.560
you must stay there for that amount of time.
You kind of um,
giving.

1273
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:44.060
So you were a monk for seven days?
Yes,

1274
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:48.050
I had all my possessions taken away and I had my head shaved,
the library shaved.

1275
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.660
I lived in the title tag.
Brow shaved.
Yeah.
They shape your eyebrows too.

1276
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.090
Why are they shave your eyebrows to make you look like among

1277
01:10:55.570 --> 01:11:00.350
the parts of the body.
So say you have this,

1278
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.620
you have this bowl and then every morning you walk this track and then there's

1279
01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:06.920
two people on the side of the road given your offerings.
So they give you rice,

1280
01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:08.420
they give you meat,
they give you this to give you that.

1281
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:10.280
And then you say chance to them.

1282
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:14.520
And that's helped to give them good Karma for either that day or that week or

1283
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.630
maybe in a future life.
And then every morning we had a blind,

1284
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.190
a blind lady and her sister would come and hold a hand,

1285
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.030
put the spoon into a bowl,
would say this chant.
And um,

1286
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:29.060
it just was so special that everyday we said this thing to her to help her have

1287
01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:33.330
this good energy because life must be shitting,
not being able to see.
So,

1288
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.210
and it just meant so much to us,
really for us come room.
And then,
um,

1289
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.290
everyday we had Buddhist studies and then they were saying how the Buddhist is

1290
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:43.020
the most oldest religion out of everything.
Uh,

1291
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:47.940
it was 500 years older than Christianity,
which is a,
a few hundred years,

1292
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:52.290
uh,
older again than a Muslim.
Uh,

1293
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:57.510
so,
and,
and then they took everything.
There's five main things with,
uh,
Buddhism.

1294
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.400
The don't kill,
don't steal,
don't cheat,
don't do drugs,
uh,
and don't lie.

1295
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:06.960
And then the Christianity took those and the edit a few things to them as well.

1296
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.950
But the best thing about Buddhism,
the,
there's no supernatural guy.

1297
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.880
It's just an old prints that was stuck in a kingdom.

1298
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:17.600
And then he didn't see the real outside world.

1299
01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:19.410
NC poor people didn't see sickness.

1300
01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.770
And then one day he went out of the Kingdom and uh,

1301
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.110
he realized that his whole life was a lie.

1302
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:29.100
So he went out into the forest and started doing,
um,
meditation.

1303
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:33.540
And that's when all these different things coming from different aspects of,
so,

1304
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.140
and then from those,
from,
uh,
the meditation,

1305
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:39.990
that's when he made these five basic principles.
If you,
if you don't drink,

1306
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.050
you're not going to tell lies and you're not gonna get in trouble and you're not

1307
01:12:43.051 --> 01:12:45.720
going to kill anybody.
So have you stay away from those things you'll,

1308
01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:49.980
you should be.
Love.
Should be.
Okay.
That's hilarious.
Okay.
So incorrect.

1309
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.220
A lot of people that don't drink,
they're full of shit.
Yeah.
And if you,

1310
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.010
if you don't,
if you don't screw your neighbor or you don't,
um,
steel and nothing,

1311
01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:02.160
you don't have to.
Yeah.
So all these bases,
just easy stuff.

1312
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.230
Just the idea of doing good behavior and being a good person and keeping a Karma

1313
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.490
coins.
Yeah,
for sure.

1314
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.060
So did you have a desire to do it for longer than seven days or did you do it

1315
01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:15.250
just because he lived in Thailand and you did it out of respect or my tie

1316
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.751
sponsor,

1317
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:18.060
his two boys were doing it and they said they're going on for seven days.

1318
01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:20.940
Do you want to join them?
He said you've done everything.
Tie,
you speak Thai,

1319
01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:22.680
you live like a tie.
You fight like a tie.

1320
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.420
The only thing you haven't done has been a month.

1321
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.700
And then once you have them the monkey,
you're the complete circle.

1322
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:30.870
You're the white version of one of them.
So yeah.
Yeah,
it was,
it was,

1323
01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:34.780
it was amazing.
It was so cool.
So when you went there,
they,

1324
01:13:34.781 --> 01:13:36.840
you'd shave your eyebrows,
you shave your head,

1325
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.660
they'll give you a bowl and then what do you do during the day?

1326
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:43.980
What does the day after we get the,
we have breakfast in the morning.

1327
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:47.210
We do Buddhist studies for about an hour or two hours after that.
Um,

1328
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:50.610
and then we're either sweeping around the temple,
keeping everything clean,

1329
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.960
and then afternoon will be Buddhist studies again in front of the error half and

1330
01:13:54.961 --> 01:13:58.920
two hours.
And then we sleep in the temple and try not to get attacked by ghost.

1331
01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:04.990
Yeah,
the ghost was scary cause yeah.
Thailand,
this ghost of so full on,
uh,

1332
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:08.240
the,
they really had this thing where they really believe in him.
So the tire,

1333
01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.970
the ghosts have a more of a tendency as shown themselves or come into your dream

1334
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:16.570
form and then it's so realistic.
They,
it was life changing.

1335
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:20.200
I had a few different dreams where I came into the temple thinking,
fuck,

1336
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:24.880
I'm changing the way that I do things from here on in.
Why is that just,

1337
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:29.590
I'm just making me a better person for,
for just basic things.

1338
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:32.610
The ghosts.
We're making you a better person.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They,

1339
01:14:32.611 --> 01:14:36.520
they just give you deep inner thoughts.
Why,
why you're dreaming and you wake up.

1340
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:41.050
You'd think that you'd was real life,
but it was,
uh,
yeah.
It's hard to explain.
No,

1341
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:45.700
please do.
So you,
you saw ghost as well.

1342
01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:50.620
I used to get attacked about three or four times a week.
Um,
they call it a PM.
Uh,

1343
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:52.960
so it,
have you ever heard of sleep paralysis?

1344
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.800
So in Thailand they believe it's a go sitting on your chest.

1345
01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.830
And then if the ghost doesn't like you,

1346
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.680
the ghost puts his hand across your mouth and nose and suffocate you in your

1347
01:15:01.681 --> 01:15:04.360
dream,
in your,
in your sleep and as well.
Yeah.
And you're doing asleep.

1348
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:10.370
They're wrong though too.
You know that.
So,
so,

1349
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:13.640
so when I told the the tires,
I had this crazy dream last night,
I was,

1350
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.480
I felt like I was getting held to the floor.
I couldn't move.
And they said,
oh,

1351
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:19.510
that's just a PM.
So I wasn't mean.
I was just to go sitting on your chest.

1352
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.910
Oh no worries.
Me Feel better.

1353
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:27.280
Try to kill it so crazy that they would be like,
no worries.
And then you'll say,

1354
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:30.490
I'm sleeping right beside someone.
And then the case would sit on your chest.

1355
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:33.820
You want to scream,
you want to reach your hand out.
So someone woke you up,

1356
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:36.430
but you're just stuck and there's nothing you can do.
And the,

1357
01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.010
how do you try and screen the more that you just get stuck to the floor.

1358
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:41.950
So this would happen on a consistent basis,
four or five times a week.

1359
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.550
How old were you at the Dome?
19.
19.
19 to 23.

1360
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.210
So if I had a gas,
you're,
you're a young man,

1361
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.830
you're in Thailand for the first time.

1362
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:53.080
You're experiencing this incredible culture shock.

1363
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:56.410
You're also experiencing the anxiety of preparing for fights.

1364
01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.310
There's whole new world that you're living in and you probably have a lot of

1365
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:04.300
questions and doubts about life and you know,
[inaudible] there's anxiety,

1366
01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:05.260
a lot of built up stuff.

1367
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:08.250
And then you're hanging around a bunch of people that are telling you to ghost,

1368
01:16:08.251 --> 01:16:11.410
to trying to kill you.
Yeah.
And so you're experiencing these,

1369
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.190
these ghosts to regularly now,
did you see anything?

1370
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:17.160
Did you physically see something,
would you say?
Um,

1371
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.740
one night I was laying in bed and,
and uh,

1372
01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:23.590
one of those ones where the eyes were closed as been about five minutes.
And,
uh,

1373
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:25.930
I heard that,
uh,
there was only me in the room at the time too.

1374
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:29.890
So I heard the door,
the fly screen open and I'm thinking,

1375
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.060
and I heard footsteps and they immediately think ghost.

1376
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.580
Now I'm thinking heart and close the door before the mosquitoes coming and then

1377
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:40.140
waiting,
waiting,
waiting.
No one's going to close the door.
I roll over.
It might.

1378
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:43.900
And as this person standing at the door and then he looks at me and then he

1379
01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:46.780
turns and I hear him walking down the steps from Compton.
Dumb mother fucker.

1380
01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:50.680
He didn't close the door.
Mosquitoes.
So I get up,
I don't know,
I'm awake.
I get up,

1381
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.870
I closed the door to go back to sleep.

1382
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:56.770
I'll get like close my eyes with another couple of minutes.
The door,

1383
01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.730
the door opens again.
Bang.
No one's closing the door.
Knife,
footsteps.
Just time.

1384
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:05.080
I look at it,
there's a cat sitting at the door and it jumps up on the shelf.

1385
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:08.670
Then jumps out the window.
I think a fuck.
So this is the second time I get up,

1386
01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:09.523
I close the door

1387
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.610
<v 2>and I'll go back.</v>

1388
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.780
This time I gave back the seat and the next morning and I go and see the,

1389
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:17.450
the tie train.
I think,
I swear your brother was here last night and he,
um,

1390
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:18.890
he must have come to the room,
but he couldn't.

1391
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:21.830
I know he left the door open and got up and he said,
no,
no,
he's not.

1392
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:24.980
He in Changwale he's about 12 hour driveway.
So now,
no,
I seen him.

1393
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:29.810
He was here 100%.
So now watch or ring is,
hey brother,
wait,

1394
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.790
wait,
wait.
And he said,
I'm Chingway.
It's like,
Oh shit.
So yeah,
so that was,

1395
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:38.360
yeah,
that was my scene.
The ghost,
uh,
firsthand,

1396
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.130
the ghost of a dude who's alive and was 12 hours away.
Sorry.

1397
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.480
It's really common in Thailand.
Like it's,
this is not about me,

1398
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:50.060
it's all about John.
But it happened to me a lot as well.

1399
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:54.890
And I think it's because we're around the ties as well.
So the suggestion,

1400
01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:58.340
that power of suggestion,
the culture,
do you know about the goatee houses?

1401
01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.400
Ghost houses.
Every Thai house has a ghost house.

1402
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:04.730
I say your house looks this noise and they have a little house in front of their

1403
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:07.650
house and they decorate it more so it's more attractive for the ghost.

1404
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.690
This is true story and then they put food,

1405
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:15.050
little bits of rice a little bit to drink and then a little bits of whiskey

1406
01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:18.240
sometimes and then before your fight you pray to the Ghost House that they,

1407
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:20.900
the ghosts will hopefully give you a good inner strength for when you go into

1408
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:25.550
battle.
Well,
it's easy to ridicule.
It's easy to ridicule and make fun of.

1409
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:29.330
But I think that when you look at things like the power of suggestion and the

1410
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:32.240
placebo effect,
what that means,

1411
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:35.900
what it really means is that the mind has incredible capabilities.

1412
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.870
The mind has the ability to heal you if you're sick.

1413
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:43.760
The mine has the ability to do all sorts of things that you think you need a

1414
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.650
drug or medication to fix.

1415
01:18:45.651 --> 01:18:50.000
I mean that's the mine is amazing and if you are around a bunch of people that

1416
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:52.340
really believe these things,

1417
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:55.880
your mind is almost preparing you for these things.
Being real.

1418
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:59.390
I don't know if ghosts are real or not real.
I've never experienced it,

1419
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.770
but everyone I know that has like studied it.

1420
01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.610
There's two types of people.
These either and maybe I haven't met enough of them,

1421
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.550
but they're charlatans who like,
you know,
they,

1422
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.000
they're just the guys who do those shows where there got like night vision there

1423
01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:16.970
in a basement somewhere and like,
did you hear that when we cut to commercial?

1424
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.590
You know,
I'll never see her shit.

1425
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:23.450
Like those ghost hunting shows like you want to talk about a show like a genre

1426
01:19:23.451 --> 01:19:27.350
with the least amount of success.
It's like it might be ghost hunting shows.

1427
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.030
Those motherfuckers have never seen a ghost.

1428
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:32.600
Like there's never a gut like you see it,
you go,
oh shit,
that's a ghost.

1429
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:35.600
I got held down in Australia once held down,

1430
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:40.280
say say my Thai training came and then I hadn't met frustrating for a couple

1431
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.150
months.
Say he's saying he's like,
what?
He's Buddhist in his hand,
his hand,

1432
01:19:43.151 --> 01:19:46.580
his big pray before I'm asleep.
I said,
be,
why are these night,

1433
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.100
we're not an in Thailand now there's negotiate west suite.

1434
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:53.510
So you've got held down by ty goes and say,
I've gone into my room.

1435
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:57.330
And then as one of those scenarios again where,
uh,
I'm just stripped,

1436
01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.990
drifting off and I hear the door open,
I'm thinking,
oh,

1437
01:19:59.991 --> 01:20:02.940
someone must be come in and get something out of the room.
And then I,

1438
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.170
he puts it and then boom,

1439
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:11.200
I'm held down as hard as I can until the mattress and I've got enough energy to

1440
01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:12.940
open my eyes.
And uh,

1441
01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.330
there was nothing there but I heard I could hear the breathing.

1442
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.670
And then,
um,
I tried to relax,
I tried to relax,

1443
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:25.580
I felt the pressure come off my chest and then as soon as they let me go grab my

1444
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:28.740
towel on my blanket and I went and slept in the toys bedroom for two weeks when

1445
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:32.340
these floor,
because I was too petrified asleep by myself for about two weeks.

1446
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:36.780
I think I shifted myself so bad cause I had my eyes,

1447
01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.660
I could hear it.
So again,
if I had to get,

1448
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:44.460
one of the things that I would say is not only young and the power of suggestion

1449
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:46.020
always things are a factor,

1450
01:20:46.021 --> 01:20:49.130
but also the fact that these things are happening to your wife's sleeping.
Yeah.

1451
01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:50.791
When you're sleeping,

1452
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:53.830
your mind produces all sorts of crazy psychedelic chemicals.

1453
01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:57.570
So it's very possible that what you're experiencing,
some semi dream state.

1454
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.400
And then in the semi dream state,

1455
01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:02.460
especially if you're convinced that go surreal and your brain starts,

1456
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.540
your imagination,

1457
01:21:03.541 --> 01:21:07.320
starts flooding your consciousness with all sorts of physical experiences.

1458
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.460
He's all sorts of physical sensations or go surreal.

1459
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:15.410
That's possible too.
I mean,
I don't know,
I mean,
I might be wrong.
It's just,

1460
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.590
there's so much fuckery involved.
Ghosts.
You know,
when you,

1461
01:21:20.591 --> 01:21:23.850
when you look at the people that are telling you about them and the people that

1462
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:27.810
say that they've seen them,
it's just,
it's so,
it's such a weird subject.

1463
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.370
It's a big,
big pot of the tall end though.

1464
01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.420
I worked for the rescue team like we spoke about last time and it's actually

1465
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.570
quite nice hearing.
He said it's tough because I'm like,
oh my God,
I'm not crazy.

1466
01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:40.370
Like one of my heroes,
John My pot this too.
But uh,
yeah man,

1467
01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.820
like everyone I know in Thailand has had something and they are so

1468
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:46.530
superstitious.
It's not even money.

1469
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.940
It's ridiculous how superstitious hell they believe.
The ghost living trees.

1470
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:53.280
So when you chop a tree down and then build your house,

1471
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.050
the ghost comes with the house that goes,
comes with say.

1472
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.440
Then there's certain polls that might be,

1473
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:02.760
might be a bit more crazy than more powerful.
And even the ring,

1474
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:03.780
the ring is made out of wood.

1475
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.750
So we used to decorate the ring with ribbons and um,

1476
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.090
powder and perfume and then we'd pray to the ring just before a fight because it

1477
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:17.110
helped get us fit for that six weeks,
eight week prep,
and then say,

1478
01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:20.250
and then we've decorated with flowers and blood flow is just the day before the

1479
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:24.190
fight to say thank you for my preparation.
Just Blah.

1480
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.300
Just a little tighter additions,
more than say,
than anything,
I guess.

1481
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:31.860
Even if it's not true.
Like if I look at,
I'm joking around,

1482
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:35.430
obviously I really don't know of ghosts are real,
but even if they're not real,

1483
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:40.730
there's something to be said for eliminating a certain amount of anxiety just by

1484
01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.780
having this ritual,

1485
01:22:42.781 --> 01:22:45.990
having this process that you go through in your mind where you believe you've

1486
01:22:45.991 --> 01:22:49.170
appeased the ghost so you believe that you will have good luck.

1487
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:51.210
So you believe that?
Yeah,
you have good Karma,

1488
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:54.930
that you have good spirits with you.
I mean if you believe in ghosts and you're,

1489
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:55.750
you know,

1490
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:59.910
you're worried about the unknown and you find a ritual that appeases that and

1491
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:03.310
then settles that fear.
I mean there's benefit in that,
it this,

1492
01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.070
but there's benefit in a lot of crazy beliefs with them.

1493
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.790
<v 3>The Rem way before,
often before a fine.
So you are down there praying and your,</v>

1494
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:12.730
your thinking of the people of the past,
the people in the present,

1495
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.490
the different people don't know what you're talking about because we explain it.

1496
01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.650
The preflight dance that we do in Thailand.

1497
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.570
So we should put up a video of that so people could see it as these,

1498
01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:25.770
it's pretty fucking cool.
And it doesn't exist in any of their combat sport.
Uh,

1499
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.570
at most combat sports.
I mean the,

1500
01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:30.370
the most you get is someone walks around and touches each corner of the,

1501
01:23:30.371 --> 01:23:33.880
of the ring and maybe bows or puts their hands up.

1502
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.010
And in Thailand it said live tie band too.

1503
01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.500
So they have a gland that drums are going and the symbols are going and the

1504
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:42.780
flute and then a boy,
your boy you're dancing,
you just,
uh,

1505
01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:46.990
you might be 100,000 people there and then you just turn it all off and then you

1506
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:51.070
just praying for you.
I'm asking permission from the Earth,
the wind,
the fire,

1507
01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:56.000
the water,
um,
food from God a to give you all this inner strength.

1508
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.090
And I myself,

1509
01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.170
I think from my mother and my father and my grandfather and my grandmother's a

1510
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.880
past,
present future,
uh,
former trainers.
Um,

1511
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:11.110
every single person that helped you get to that present point in that particular

1512
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:15.310
second that you think thanking for helping.
You get right there in that time.

1513
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:16.720
And then,
um,

1514
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.440
you take a big breath in all that energy just fills up your whole body and it

1515
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:23.530
was all you get pins and needles in the hair stands up on the back of your neck

1516
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.900
and then once you finish the dance,
it feels like you're a,
you're invincible.
Wow.

1517
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.200
When these guys are doing it right now and they have the traditional hand wraps,

1518
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:37.100
they have,
this is a,
there's your,
we're starting to see that come back or you're,

1519
01:24:37.101 --> 01:24:38.230
you're seeing a lot of,
uh,

1520
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.820
bounce that are being made today with a really hand wraps and no gloves.
Yeah,

1521
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:46.300
it's pretty,
pretty hectic.
They said once a year entirely and for ever.

1522
01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.510
And they have totally inverse Burma and they have two referees.

1523
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:50.950
And then what happens?

1524
01:24:50.951 --> 01:24:54.490
You can only win by knockout or cut if it goes the distance.
It's a draw,

1525
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:57.190
no matter how much someone's winning,
it's,
it's always a drawer.

1526
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:01.810
So you have to win by a violence.
How many rounds?
Uh,
five,
five rounds.
Wow.

1527
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:05.860
And you,
you can't win by any other way by knock out or cut.
That's crazy.

1528
01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.890
And then there's not many kicks her knees cause you know,
you were in um,

1529
01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.150
two weapons on your fists.

1530
01:25:12.151 --> 01:25:16.770
So it's just a healthy liver technique is a Linda and then more so survival.

1531
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:18.370
Well weapons on your fist,

1532
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:22.510
meaning that it's just the rope because it's not,

1533
01:25:22.511 --> 01:25:26.440
those are not like traditional hand wraps where it's like soft and cushiony.

1534
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.480
Yeah.
What is that?
It's a,

1535
01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:32.080
it's proper and it goes all the way down the forearm to,
why is that?

1536
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:35.960
Cause I like to protect you from Kix.
Uh,
I'm not sure it was traditional,
I think.

1537
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.230
Tell me a bit about the bedding with uh,
the Weichert as well.
Yes.
Um,

1538
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:46.300
a lot of,
a lot of toys will,
um,
make judgment on who dances better.

1539
01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:48.280
Also in the WHO,
who is more relaxed in,

1540
01:25:48.281 --> 01:25:52.330
who has a bit of a rhythm and stall with their,
with their dances.

1541
01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.610
Well so they can see who was,
um,

1542
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.840
if you are stiff and fucked up and we're another go,
I is just flowing like a,

1543
01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:01.720
like a ballerina and then go,
oh,
this guy has got this for sure.

1544
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.400
And when you're watching this,
like when they're doing this dance,

1545
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.540
<v 2>is it,
there's a specific routine they follow or are they just being like,</v>

1546
01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.880
they just going with the flow of things?
Some,

1547
01:26:10.881 --> 01:26:14.750
some gyms have the their own stall or the majority of the time it's pretty much

1548
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:19.660
the same thing.
But uh,
yeah.
Different.
Why are you praying at this thought?
That's,

1549
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:24.410
that's my biggest thing is getting connected to the universe and uh,

1550
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.273
trying to,

1551
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:29.060
trying to get good energy and in the rest of this stuff that they're doing.
Yeah.

1552
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:31.970
It's more so of a limbo.
So you,
as you're going from rope the rope,

1553
01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:34.310
you're warming up your body,
you're stretching out the shoulders,

1554
01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:35.450
you're stretching at your legs.

1555
01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.990
And the guy explained to me once also the way he did it,

1556
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:41.380
he would relax because it was,
um,

1557
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:44.120
it was sorta performing in front of all these people.
Yes.

1558
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.780
As he was doing it and it helped him perform better in his fighting cause it

1559
01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:50.470
wasn't just like,
are you ready?
Are you ready?
Go.
Yes.

1560
01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.350
Like he'd already done something in front of all these people and then it sort

1561
01:26:54.351 --> 01:26:59.030
of loosen up,
loosen them up.
Before I ever did a commentary for the UFC,

1562
01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:04.031
I got the comment tight on a one of a cobots fight and luck some toy.

1563
01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:08.360
How'd he say it?
I was on,
I believe so.
Yeah.

1564
01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:12.410
This was way back in the days before 2002,
which was when I was,

1565
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.390
when I started commentating for the u s I started,

1566
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.430
I was the post fight interview guy and like 97 to 98 and then I commentated from

1567
01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:24.320
2002 on.
But in between then I was working at um,
uh,

1568
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.921
not working.

1569
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:28.860
I was working out at a John Jack Machado's and me and Richard Norton,
uh,

1570
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:31.460
you know where she's in Australia and gay.
Yeah.
Martial arts guy.

1571
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.080
We show some stuff together.
Yeah.
He,
um,
he and I did a,

1572
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:37.700
we commentated on coal bonds fight.
It was amazing.

1573
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.000
It was amazing to see like a real tie legend who said,

1574
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:44.920
who knows how many hundred fights you got to get the to fight to get the Bangkok

1575
01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.230
Bank cooks amazing.
I don't know,
eventually maybe I'll do a UFC out there,

1576
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:53.150
but is it a UFC even legal there tried to ban it a couple of times and I think

1577
01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:57.110
that ties you a little bit funny about the cage because it's taken away from
the,

1578
01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.410
uh,
they didn't want it to taking over the sport going toy,

1579
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.720
like it's taking over every other country in the womb.

1580
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:05.750
It must have been an amazing experience for you.
Just,
I mean,

1581
01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:08.510
just to go there as a young man,

1582
01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:11.600
as a teenager and just get immersed in this life.

1583
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.190
It's so different than just like taking a Moyie Thai class at a gym or even

1584
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:19.950
getting obsessed with Moy Tai in Australia or in America where you know,

1585
01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.630
you're working out all the time and you love boy tie.
But to be living there,

1586
01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:28.200
Thailand,
the best pilot that I look back at one upon is not just the,

1587
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:32.420
the,
the training and the fighting,
but the ghosts becoming a white tie,

1588
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.630
white tie.
Because I was the only Westerner for,

1589
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:39.260
I'd go months and months on end without seeing another white person.
Wow.

1590
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.710
I was like the freaky,
if you will.
And then I'd go to the shops in,

1591
01:28:43.711 --> 01:28:46.280
every single person would stare at me and I love it.
And now I can speak Thai.

1592
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.510
So I sat talking to them and they'd freak out and I'd,

1593
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:53.060
and then I'd start going to the nightclubs.
And,
um,
uh,

1594
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:53.780
for instance,

1595
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:57.080
sometimes I'd have a live band and then I'd go up to the band and saying,
Hey,

1596
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:58.820
you know,
this song.
And then I,
I,

1597
01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:02.020
they give me the microphone and I'd seen tie through the crowd and

1598
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:06.450
<v 3>the crowd would bounce that everyone's like dancing.
And stuff.</v>

1599
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.070
That's crazy.
It was awesome.
It was such a good buzz to wow.

1600
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:16.290
To live in,
to live,
to live like one of them.
So that sounds insane.

1601
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.170
It was awesome.
It was so cool.
Wow.
Must've been to such a,

1602
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:23.340
you're like a whole new universe and you come back to Australia and you had just

1603
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.730
blend in with everyone else and then you go back to Thailand and you're back to

1604
01:29:26.731 --> 01:29:29.520
being that special person in the suburb again.

1605
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.120
And then I used to run on the road and everyone used to flash your lights and me

1606
01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:36.790
and toot their horn because I was the fighter kid,
the Ozzie cause he guy.

1607
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.080
So I was,
I was special.

1608
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:43.520
It was really amazing to you really enjoyed that aspect of it.
Just being unique,

1609
01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:45.800
being unique,
getting in a taxi and talking to her,

1610
01:29:45.801 --> 01:29:48.330
the taxi driver and I could just have a conversation forever.

1611
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:51.870
I was going and just talking about everything will be right most I of course.

1612
01:29:51.871 --> 01:29:55.620
But um,
wherever I went I was just,
it was so cool in a sense.

1613
01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:58.890
Is that place like your second home?
Uh,

1614
01:29:58.891 --> 01:30:00.690
I don't get in any more now.

1615
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.410
The last time I went there was probably three or four years ago when I fought

1616
01:30:04.411 --> 01:30:07.140
yards in glee.
But um,
but yeah,

1617
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:10.530
because now the fights are so hard for such little money.

1618
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.230
Like if I went back now,
I'd be lucky to make it $1,000 a fight.

1619
01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:17.550
I'm better off fighting Westerners and I can make 10 times the amount of money

1620
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:19.440
for an easier fight,
if that makes sense.

1621
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:24.270
It's just amazing that you're paid that left that low amount to fight in front

1622
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:28.240
of 100,000 people because if I lived there,
the currencies quite quite high.

1623
01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.440
But then synergy or transfer that over to Australian and then you can't even,

1624
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.060
boy and Donald's talk about taxis is actually in a taxi.
Oh God.

1625
01:30:36.061 --> 01:30:39.740
About six,
seven years ago,
he goes,
oh,
what are you doing here in time?
And like,

1626
01:30:39.741 --> 01:30:43.420
and I'm doing my Tai Chi o you know,
Raymond Deck?
I'm like,
yeah,
no room.
Deca.

1627
01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.150
He goes,
wait from like Australia goes,
Oh,
you're not John Wayne Park.
Oh Shit.

1628
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.490
That's awesome.
That's a long time ago.

1629
01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:53.190
How long did it take you to learn the language?
Uh,

1630
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:56.820
three months before I could hold one conversation.
So,
uh,

1631
01:30:56.821 --> 01:31:00.750
I remember the very first I used to,
I used to learn,
uh,
okay,

1632
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:05.640
eat kin,
drink a dumb numb,
and then I've got my first sentence.

1633
01:31:05.641 --> 01:31:07.860
I still remember it as a,
that they said,
okay,

1634
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:10.530
we're going to send you to the shop.
We want you to say,
um,

1635
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:15.590
I would like one bag of ice upon Dongen numb Kang Known Tom.

1636
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.190
So as I walked down the street in my head upon them,
um,

1637
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:21.690
and then,
uh,

1638
01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:26.690
from there I work okay if instead of saying ice upon Dungan and cook or upon

1639
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:29.010
long and then a right.

1640
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.820
And then I started getting sentences and then I'd start asking questions,
okay,

1641
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:36.450
what's this?
What's that?
What's this?
And then before I knew it,

1642
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:40.830
all of a sudden I was,
um,
I was one of them.
Wow.
I can't read or write,

1643
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:44.760
but I can hold,
I started watching the soap operas on the TV.

1644
01:31:44.761 --> 01:31:47.460
I could watch the news.
I started picking up the songs.
Now.

1645
01:31:47.461 --> 01:31:51.920
Now the songs had meanings besides just noise,
right?
Uh,
yeah,

1646
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:55.030
that's gotta be bizarre when it sort of starts revealing itself to me.

1647
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.840
I started thinking toy was there for that long.

1648
01:31:57.841 --> 01:32:01.390
I stopped thinking English and I started thinking in Thai.
Uh,

1649
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.270
that's when it got scary because I came back to Australia and I start my

1650
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:06.270
sentences in English and I finished him and tie.

1651
01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:10.330
But I wouldn't know that I was finishing his eye looking at me going,

1652
01:32:10.331 --> 01:32:11.790
what the hell did you just say?

1653
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:17.740
And then I started to speak in pigeon because the toys,
um,
I started,
uh,

1654
01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:22.420
me hungry me,
me,
Firsti don't have to westerners.
And I like,
oh,

1655
01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:23.260
what am I doing?

1656
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:27.160
But it was just normal because that's the way I lived for so long while just

1657
01:32:27.161 --> 01:32:30.380
trying to figure out how to readjust.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It took a wall to go.

1658
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:32.980
That's so bizarre.
It was cool.
It was,

1659
01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.740
that's fascinating that you did it without any books now.

1660
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.460
And there's no internet.
So if I wanted to talk to mum,

1661
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:40.510
I'd have to write a letter.

1662
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.930
It always takes seven days to get to Australia and then she'll reply to be a

1663
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:45.760
seven day returns.
There was a two week,

1664
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:51.060
two week waiting period between no Facebook,
no,
no Google.
No,
no,
no.

1665
01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.570
I have no idea if you were okay.

1666
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.910
If it's every now and again she might ring for my birthday or ring for a special

1667
01:32:57.911 --> 01:33:00.160
occasion or if someone passed away,
hey,
bad news.

1668
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:04.390
Such as if the phone rang and it was for me the be the really good news or

1669
01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:05.224
really bad.

1670
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:09.530
So did you have any desire to try to learn how to write it or how to read?

1671
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:10.450
I tried,

1672
01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:15.451
but there's like a 27 valves and one if you put one letter at the start of a

1673
01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:18.130
word,
it's a completely different noise.

1674
01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:22.510
If you put an end of a word and it's all tones.
So one word means five things.

1675
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:25.600
So the word cow,
Carmine's rice,

1676
01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.640
white mountain news knee.
So if you say,
if you say it in a different tone,

1677
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.170
I'd like to have a plate of knees.
What's the tone like?

1678
01:33:35.171 --> 01:33:39.640
What are the different ways of saying,
ah cow,
cow,
cow,
cow,

1679
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:46.600
cow.
Wow.
So,
and then,
yeah,
it's all timing and say the whole time you're talking,

1680
01:33:46.601 --> 01:33:48.980
it's almost like you're singing.
Wow.

1681
01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.470
Asian languages are so fascinating to me.
A lot of the words are the same words,

1682
01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:58.160
like the word California's sins,
cow or luck.
So you just,
it's the same word.

1683
01:33:58.161 --> 01:34:00.820
It's a different meaning.
So I try and I try and learn five words a day.

1684
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:04.810
I go to bed and land,
land on my pillow.
All right,
got it.
Next Day.
Okay,

1685
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:07.150
now five new more things.
Okay.
Doop,
doop,
doop,
doop.

1686
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:11.740
And then you can only kind of keep those things in your head if you're,
you're,

1687
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.610
you practicing it on a regular basis.
Right.
And because I live with kids as well,

1688
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:16.690
those kids in the camp,

1689
01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.960
and then you could joke around with them and if you said something wrong,

1690
01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:22.630
they'd laugh and go,
no stupid.
It's,
he say it like this,

1691
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:23.980
but he said it to an adult.

1692
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:26.130
You feel a little bit sort of shy and embarrassed by it.

1693
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.170
But to a kid you just slap on the back of the head and they said the [inaudible]

1694
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:31.830
laugh anymore.
So,
um,

1695
01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.090
child beating by John Wayne part.
This is how you learn language properly.

1696
01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.680
Speaking of Baiting Thailand,
so back there,
there's,

1697
01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:45.940
there's still um,
they still beat their boxes.
It's still pretty.

1698
01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.990
There's no,
no one looks down upon it.
So if the tires,

1699
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.040
if they're not training hard,

1700
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.580
it's nothing for them to get a slap across the face or are kicking the leg or a

1701
01:34:54.581 --> 01:34:58.070
punching them may awful.
Um,
yeah,
they,
they

1702
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.500
<v 2>want their books is to exceed everything else.</v>

1703
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.200
So the child cruelties still pretty normal.

1704
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.760
So child cruelty meaning that's one thing that maybe people aren't aware of.

1705
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.190
They start fighting very young.
Yeah.

1706
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:13.550
So if you fight and you're afraid of your opponent,

1707
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:17.660
they have the thing called around six and then that might include you getting

1708
01:35:17.661 --> 01:35:21.680
bashed by one of the trainers after you get home.
And then it's like,
okay,

1709
01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.430
around six meaning you fight five rounds and then you come back and they come

1710
01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:26.990
back and then you get your ass kicked.

1711
01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.270
And this like what are you going to be scared of if you're going to be scared of

1712
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:30.740
the training,
kicking your ass when you get back.

1713
01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.000
Are you going to be scared of your opponent,

1714
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:36.200
someone your size and weight with rules or are you going to be scared of me so

1715
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:39.660
they get more scared of the round six and they do their opponents and then they

1716
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.420
turn in the beam men very fast.
Wow.
That's crazy.

1717
01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:44.900
Is to make kids like walk home.

1718
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:49.340
I've tried to pick up a kid down here from my account a couple of years back and

1719
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:51.520
they're trying to shout him if we're giving a lift home,

1720
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:54.560
I'll go like a lot of trouble with the camp because they he lost and he had no

1721
01:35:54.561 --> 01:35:56.270
heart and they've said no,
he's got a walker.
It was like,

1722
01:35:56.650 --> 01:36:01.310
it was like a 30 minute drive.
Lebanon,
like a walk view one in the morning.

1723
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.520
It's weird because they don't get a chance or like they don't get a choice

1724
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:08.330
rather whereas like if you have a young kid and they really aspire,

1725
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:10.550
there's some young kids that they aspire to fight.

1726
01:36:10.551 --> 01:36:13.910
At a very young age and that's what they're driven to.
These kids,

1727
01:36:13.911 --> 01:36:15.980
a lot of them don't get a chance to decide.

1728
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:18.980
They're just kind of pushed into these camps.
It says,
imagine,

1729
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:23.000
imagine the average salary is 500 a week.

1730
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.960
If you're a famous boxer,
you might make 5,000 a week.

1731
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:29.150
So there's this drive it,

1732
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.070
if I can be just a normal Joe Bloggs cooking rice on the side of the road,
or if,

1733
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:36.980
if I'm a famous boxer all of a sudden like could be the next toy version of

1734
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:39.390
Floyd Mayweather,
like Saint,
like sandy soils,
uh,

1735
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:43.230
Yo single and a bouquet or somebody.
So there,
there is,
there is,
um,

1736
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:47.690
a chance to get out of poverty through fighting a guy like yachts and client.

1737
01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.690
Like how much does that guy make?
Like what's the equivalent American?
Not,
not,

1738
01:36:52.691 --> 01:36:57.200
not,
not like,
not money,
but I mean like what is,
you know,
like whatever,

1739
01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:01.690
what it's worth in Thailand,
he's a Rockstar rockstar.
Like he has a nice house,

1740
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:05.630
Nice cars.
Who knows it,
like with tires,
I don't know about that generation,

1741
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:08.300
but like most Thai fighters I've known over the years,

1742
01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:11.840
they don't like know how to spend the money.
But there was a father,

1743
01:37:11.841 --> 01:37:15.050
I think he fought here in America the other day and I know him very well since I

1744
01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:16.160
was young.
I'm not going to say his name.

1745
01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:20.000
[inaudible] matches since I was about 20 and I saw him mom,
like,
you know,

1746
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:23.630
he's fought in America.
It'd be making let's say $5,000 a flight.

1747
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:27.860
It's a lot of money in Thailand.
And he still lives in just like a little shit.

1748
01:37:27.861 --> 01:37:30.280
Like who knows what they're doing with the money you give them the camp food

1749
01:37:30.281 --> 01:37:30.830
could descend,

1750
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:34.970
you might send your mum and dad 30% and then you just live off that 20% until

1751
01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:38.810
you nix void.
And then you might drink that.
You might drink it and smoke it.

1752
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.780
So when you say he's a rock star is not really a rock star.

1753
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:45.380
I mean he's this famous,
he's comfortable financial.

1754
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.950
Who's making all the money over there?
Uh,
the promoters,
camps,
promoters.
Yeah.

1755
01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.060
And the gambling is fascinating.
[inaudible] good,

1756
01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:59.850
<v 3>good,
good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
everyone's had their own bookmaker,</v>

1757
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.220
so you're watching two fights and watching red and blue.

1758
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:06.030
And then after the first round,
it might be two for one for the red,

1759
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.920
and then he's still winning round three it might be five for one and then five

1760
01:38:10.921 --> 01:38:15.520
for one was say if you bet a hundred,
a hundred baht oh five,
four one odds,

1761
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.400
and then brown for all of a sudden Brie blue starts dominating.

1762
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:22.050
And then that the odds that changing,

1763
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:23.970
but you've already locked in your five for one this way.

1764
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:28.400
So if you play in deciding all this stuff,

1765
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:33.120
everybody's their input maker.
So you're in the crowd he's offering for,
for him.

1766
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:35.580
But besides that guy's offering five one,
I'm going to go with him.

1767
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.790
I'm going to kick these guys up.
And then you,
once you got your lock,

1768
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.960
your bed on your lock,
eyes locked on,
done.
And then after the fights,

1769
01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:45.930
then you walk over.
Yep.
Got The money.
Cheers mate.
Thank you.
Wow,

1770
01:38:45.931 --> 01:38:50.360
that's interesting.
So it's completely unorganized chaos.
It's amazing.

1771
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.690
It's controlled chaos.
That's what it sounds fascinating.
It's,

1772
01:38:53.691 --> 01:38:55.800
it's brilliant because,
uh,
uh,

1773
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.470
sorta brewing because it's like going to the horse races.

1774
01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:01.380
Nobody cares about the fires.
Who Cares who wins?
You're seeing,

1775
01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:02.820
you're seeing crazy matches.

1776
01:39:02.821 --> 01:39:06.420
And then once you've got your bed on to now you're cheering this guy home,

1777
01:39:06.421 --> 01:39:10.350
like blood last,
final hydro,
couple hundred meters for horse race.
Go,

1778
01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:15.030
go gig.
And then they hear the crab.
Ooh,
Ooh.
It's just raise after every kick,

1779
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:19.950
every punch.
And then,
um,
uh,
they have a thing called uh,
uh,
money injection.

1780
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.080
So say you're losing the first three rounds and then they call it achieved.

1781
01:39:25.081 --> 01:39:30.030
Yeah.
So I'll give you,
I'll give you 50,000 back bonus in around four.

1782
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.970
Tell him I'll give him $50,000 bonus if he wins by knockout.

1783
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.270
And then how you another 50,000,
if you know what happened,

1784
01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:40.440
that thing froze again.
Yeah.
Did you call them after the last time?
It froze.

1785
01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.620
Hello?
Call them.
This is bullshit.

1786
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:47.790
This is two out of 10 podcasts that thinks crashed on us.
Sorry.

1787
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:52.650
We'll get the audio of it and we'll sync it all up with the use terms down.
Yep.

1788
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.130
Um,
so I'm sorry,
don't mean to interrupt.
So they're,
they're screaming,
cheering,

1789
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.890
50,000 bucks bonus.
So if you're,
if you're losing and then someone says,

1790
01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:04.650
I'll give you 50,000 if you win by knockout this next round,

1791
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:09.610
all of a sudden you're tired,
you're losing,
and then 50,000 yeah.

1792
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.990
All of a sudden you've got this second wind and you weren't to go out there and

1793
01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:15.390
hurt him and then you're knock him out and then the guy comes up,

1794
01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.050
here's your 50,000 I've just made 200,000 you can have 50,000 of it.

1795
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.160
That's incredible.
So when this is all going on,
is that,

1796
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:27.750
that's also why the ties tend to fight slowly in the first round.

1797
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:31.430
The first round,
they kind of pace themselves.
It's almost like,

1798
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:36.150
it's almost like you want to lose the first round and so the odds go to the

1799
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:39.650
favor of the other corner.
You put the money on there,
your guy,

1800
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.520
you might get your three for one,
or let's just for 10 for one,
he's losing bad.

1801
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:47.730
He's getting his bash.
He's no way you can come back and then boom,
when's,

1802
01:40:47.731 --> 01:40:48.710
once he gets the,

1803
01:40:48.711 --> 01:40:51.890
the red light from the trainer and then he's on full steam ahead,
bump.

1804
01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:52.830
And that's the other way.

1805
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:57.010
And you've just been so strange that the culture of fighting like this,

1806
01:40:57.011 --> 01:41:00.250
the sport,
the art itself is so,

1807
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:05.290
so influenced by gambling.
And then what you have now is a,
well forever,

1808
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.800
the muffling implements say they might,
they might say,
look,

1809
01:41:08.801 --> 01:41:13.510
you're earning 50,000,
but for noma flight we'll give you 300,000 fight.

1810
01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:18.490
If you happened that lady on round two by a head kick and knee,
and then,

1811
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:22.960
uh,
say some you might be today,
Paul,
you're unbelievable.

1812
01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:26.260
And then the mafia might come along this actually do this.

1813
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.740
And then Nixon around you don't know how to hold your hands up and then you get

1814
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:32.710
hate keep.
And then the referer guys,
stop,
stop,
stop.

1815
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.190
I've seen you fight 400 times.
You're a legend.
There's no way.
No,

1816
01:41:36.191 --> 01:41:37.330
you didn't know how to throw a jab.

1817
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:41.620
A this flight is now considered a no contest and this will go to a church,

1818
01:41:41.670 --> 01:41:45.700
the church tribunal and you're looking at it at six months and net could be the

1819
01:41:45.701 --> 01:41:49.840
worst possible thing for any Thai boxing camp because now you bought dishonesty

1820
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:54.270
and distrust and your camp,
his name is near mud.
Did you get,

1821
01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.660
hold on Zach,
does that happen all the time?
All the time.
All the time.

1822
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:02.980
At least five,
six,
seven times a week.
Five,
six,

1823
01:42:02.981 --> 01:42:06.610
seven times a week.
And how many times does that happen to you?
To me,

1824
01:42:06.611 --> 01:42:09.340
I'm there being offered money cause then I'm western so they know they can walk

1825
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:14.020
over me if they try.
But I've seen it happen on toy TV so many times.

1826
01:42:14.021 --> 01:42:16.660
Halfway through the flight.
He know they can walk over you.
What do you mean?

1827
01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:20.350
Oh it just,
just a westerner.
If they know I'm beatable.

1828
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.750
Where you've got to l um,

1829
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:26.740
there's so many ties and Thailand that there's so many guys in the waiting line

1830
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:29.230
that know they can,
like you had symbolize that,

1831
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:33.800
haven't got a name that has just machines.
It,
it's hard to say.
Uh,

1832
01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.270
yeah,
I know.
I know.
I'm not elite that I,
I'm never going to be beaten.

1833
01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:40.530
So the tire just believe they can just walk over here.

1834
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:42.610
But so because you're a westerner,

1835
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.660
they believed in you so they don't offer you bribes to lose.

1836
01:42:46.690 --> 01:42:47.720
And there had been offered a bribe,

1837
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:52.060
a guy like gods and Cli who's such a heavily favored fighter.

1838
01:42:52.061 --> 01:42:54.780
That would be the type of guy that they would try to influence.
Yeah.

1839
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.140
That they'd probably asked you.

1840
01:42:56.141 --> 01:42:58.590
I'd single out a lay down before they'd asked me because he,

1841
01:42:58.630 --> 01:43:00.310
he's such a favorite to win.

1842
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:04.960
So I'd be at the long shot and then if I won all of a sudden,
yeah,

1843
01:43:04.961 --> 01:43:05.620
it's crazy.

1844
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:10.620
So for fighters like that is super critical to be involved in a very influential

1845
01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:14.690
camp so that you don't get asked to lay down.
Yeah.
If you are,

1846
01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:17.440
if you are one of the big gyms,
it made set,

1847
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:22.150
let's pretend Tristar and all of a sudden George goes down from fighting someone

1848
01:43:22.151 --> 01:43:25.030
that he shouldn't and then all of a sudden tries to,

1849
01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:28.690
and I don't want to put Tristar goes on my show is anymore because,
uh,

1850
01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:32.440
they are obviously mafia influence,
so we don't want to deal with them anymore.

1851
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.030
Wow.
Yeah.
It's crazy though.
The system over there.
So,
um,

1852
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.480
so for long that's so,
uh,

1853
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:44.110
that's so crazy that they have to think about that as well as fighting the best

1854
01:43:44.111 --> 01:43:48.550
fighters in the world and more tai and then they have to worry about being

1855
01:43:48.551 --> 01:43:51.930
influenced by gambling and by the Mafia.
Yeah.

1856
01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:56.990
But w w without saying any names or any camps.
I know of two,

1857
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:01.520
I know of a camp in Thailand that two of the guys did happen to lay down and

1858
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:06.140
bought this respect to the camp and um,
they might've passed away.

1859
01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:10.560
And then the,
for a certain amount of money,
um,

1860
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:13.670
to the Thai police though,
that file goes missing.

1861
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.040
And then it's just the warning to the other boxes that,
um,

1862
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:20.060
it's not a good idea to lay down on from my gym.

1863
01:44:20.061 --> 01:44:24.290
Otherwise you could also go missing.
Wow.
Yay.

1864
01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.370
And I'm like,
great.
I'm not,
I'm not talking and rubbish data.
That's true stories.

1865
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:29.540
Oh,
I'm sure.
I mean,

1866
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:32.680
it only makes sense if you're talking about that amount of money you're talking

1867
01:44:32.681 --> 01:44:35.180
to you about.
The train is invested so much money in these fighters.

1868
01:44:35.181 --> 01:44:37.610
He's fed them,
he's looked at him,
he's given places to sleep,

1869
01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:42.320
and then they discredit him by,
by doing that to fill their own pockets.
Go,
well,

1870
01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:45.710
fuck you.
I'm going to,
I'll teach you a lesson.
One you'll never forget.

1871
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.540
So what,

1872
01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:52.250
what kind of influence does the mafia have over Muay Thai in Thailand?

1873
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:53.890
Other than that,
I mean,
there's,

1874
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.340
obviously they're going to try to get people to fix fights,
but it,

1875
01:44:56.341 --> 01:44:59.090
was there any other influence that it has?
I mean,
how prevalent is it over there?

1876
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:02.600
Oh,
I imagine,
imagine the,
um,
uh,

1877
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:07.630
sometimes they're on the front of the TV and then the guy will have a clipboard

1878
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:11.720
with velcro and he'll have 10 phones on a clipboard and you'll talk to everyone

1879
01:45:11.721 --> 01:45:14.870
at once.
Okay.
It's now seven,
four,
one for the blue corner.

1880
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:19.820
And then some guy will have a emoc or when he's top pocket and it'll be blue.

1881
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:21.550
And then the red starts turning around,

1882
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.350
he techies [inaudible] and change it over to white and all of a sudden the

1883
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:28.550
betting site is changing.
So there's all these different,
oh,
that's amazing.

1884
01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:31.850
It's so full on unless you know the,
the game and how to do it.

1885
01:45:31.851 --> 01:45:34.940
And I'm still learning.
I'm still watching things going,
holy shit,
this is in,

1886
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:38.270
it's a different league of m sport.

1887
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.620
Do they ever have issues with people not paying their desk?

1888
01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:44.670
Like people look at you and five to one or whatever the fuck they do the,

1889
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.920
and then in big money,

1890
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:50.570
so he might be a hundred thousand and 50,000 or 500,000 and all of a sudden,

1891
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:54.090
yeah,
they might possibly go missing Lazzarini here.

1892
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.680
So fascinating that that aspect of it and gambling in Asia seems so prevalent.

1893
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:05.240
I mean all throughout the casinos here in America,
like she,

1894
01:46:05.241 --> 01:46:09.320
Alot of people from Asia,
a lot of Asian people gambling there.

1895
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:13.820
And in Macau obviously they have the Macau they say is like way bigger than

1896
01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:15.910
Vegas.
Yep.
They say the gambling there,

1897
01:46:15.911 --> 01:46:19.190
it's just off the charts and people who were just stupid,

1898
01:46:19.191 --> 01:46:23.530
wealthy gambling ridiculous amounts of money.
But they have a,
a toy.

1899
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:26.750
I'm way too white paper that comes at every day and they'll tell you that,
okay,

1900
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:30.560
what's the odds are for each void?
It's annoying what the odds are.
A more,
uh,

1901
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:34.850
who one big last night.
Uh,
it's,
it's all about gambling.

1902
01:46:34.851 --> 01:46:38.180
It's not about the fights where the matchups it's about,
uh,
making,

1903
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:41.540
making mind gambling's illegal.
I think in Thailand,
Thai boxing day,

1904
01:46:41.541 --> 01:46:44.210
they turn a blind eye if you're playing,

1905
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.260
if you're playing poker at home with them,
60,
mh from next door,

1906
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:51.570
one of the other neighbors could look through the window,
bring the police,

1907
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.530
and then they'll come in with six swat cars in air race,
everyone in the house.

1908
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:57.050
From the kids to the grandparents from,

1909
01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:01.180
for playing poker in indoors in their own lounge room.
That's insane.

1910
01:47:01.181 --> 01:47:03.780
And this happens on a regular basis.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.

1911
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:08.670
They come in and arrest people for gambling with her family.
Yes.
That's insane.

1912
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:11.310
But you can bet on the fights.
Wow.
And what's the,

1913
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:14.400
what's the logic behind that is just seems to be,

1914
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:17.100
for some reason there's seems to be a turn,

1915
01:47:17.101 --> 01:47:19.650
a blind eye and it's run by the army to the,

1916
01:47:19.690 --> 01:47:24.540
the big stadiums are run by the army to serve dinner.
Wow.

1917
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.770
That's so fascinating.

1918
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.580
So what did that to me has always been one of the most bizarre parts of more

1919
01:47:30.581 --> 01:47:34.020
time watching all those people screaming and bedding and throwing their hands up

1920
01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:36.210
in the air.
And me as someone who's never been over there,

1921
01:47:36.211 --> 01:47:38.290
I never understood what was going on.
Yup.

1922
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.380
But it's crazy that you being over there,

1923
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:43.500
I didn't know what was going on either and you're still trying to figure it out.

1924
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:47.200
And after all these years,
I,
I've,
I,
when I fought my first fight,
Olympia,

1925
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.720
I was losing the first year round.
And then,
um,
I started landing a few key,

1926
01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.920
I must've been like 10,
four line 24,
one even.
And then,
uh,

1927
01:47:54.970 --> 01:47:58.920
I started landing a few punches and then the crowd just changed.
Bang.
And then,

1928
01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:01.320
um,
it was what got to the stage.

1929
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:03.630
It was so deafening that it gives you that second wind.

1930
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.820
Every time he landed shut,

1931
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:07.850
all of a sudden it feels like you're invincible in there.
And then,
uh,

1932
01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.520
ended up knocking the garden at in the fourth round.
So I made every single one,

1933
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:15.750
every single,
but all the guys in the,
in the stadium so much money,
cause it's 20,

1934
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:20.010
put down 1000 bucks and you get a 20,000 back.
And he's like,
this is,
yeah,

1935
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.330
it's pretty,
it's pretty cool.

1936
01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:24.420
So that is probably one of the reasons why it's so popular over there.

1937
01:48:24.421 --> 01:48:28.990
So it's like almost like their version of horse races.
Exactly,
exactly.
Wow.
Alone.

1938
01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:31.170
Pitney has gone now you were back then,

1939
01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:33.180
Long Pena like is the most family stayed in the world?

1940
01:48:33.181 --> 01:48:36.950
You are pretty much the only main western it was fighting heaps of wishing is

1941
01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:41.280
the Deca was there.
And,
um,
then he bill and even,
uh,
my new interest,
you know,

1942
01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.590
Maine,
he was right in their regular also,

1943
01:48:43.591 --> 01:48:47.580
but the tires are coming to the change room and instead of looking at it they'll

1944
01:48:47.581 --> 01:48:50.340
come and feel your arms like a horse.
See how fit you are.

1945
01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:54.960
Look you up and down like you're just a piece of meat.
Should I put money on him?

1946
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:58.420
Yeah,
sure.
We looked pretty good when we looked a bit flabby.
Nah,

1947
01:48:58.570 --> 01:48:59.403
a bit on the other guy.

1948
01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:04.330
So just check you out and talking to and come and feel you and every hot sheet

1949
01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.320
touch your ability to see if you had a strong stomach.
These are just gamblers.

1950
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:11.270
I just gamblers and then fucking weird and then edit them at long painting them

1951
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:13.350
the change rooms next to the Thai toilets as well.

1952
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:14.660
So as they're coming in for a pitch,

1953
01:49:14.661 --> 01:49:17.510
they might come in and fill your ass while you're pissing.

1954
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:21.540
So what kind of rewards you got?
Pretty much.
Pretty Bizarre.

1955
01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:25.290
Did anybody ever get angry?
Like when people were touching him like that?

1956
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:28.620
It's just so normal that it's not even frowned upon.
It's just like,
oh yeah,

1957
01:49:28.621 --> 01:49:32.730
hey going,
let's still do it today.
Yeah.
Similar.
They're just still do it today.

1958
01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:36.750
Yeah,
it's just normal.
It's just started culture.
Just there a lot of squeeze you.

1959
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:40.320
Yay.
Pretty much.
How strange do they have women fighting over there?

1960
01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:44.640
It's just that I had before I started bed the last 10 years or something before

1961
01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:46.860
the ties.
The women,
even to this day,

1962
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:49.960
I'll let it touch the ring on the main stadiums in,
in the,

1963
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:52.060
in the country and the smallest things delay the flight,

1964
01:49:52.061 --> 01:49:53.300
but they've got to go under the bottom row.

1965
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:56.530
Then I'll let her climb the top brick cause it's quiet when they get into the

1966
01:49:56.531 --> 01:50:00.310
ring and they must cop on their belly and Rolanda why?
Because and,

1967
01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.250
and then the old painting and the rigid them dunes,
they um,

1968
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.160
they're not let it touch the ring yet because they give a girl gyms.

1969
01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:11.470
So you go girl,
go gyms and then I say in case you get cut.
Oh,

1970
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:16.390
so you want to hear a funny one periods,
say the uh,
as a time male,

1971
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:18.550
you know,
let it go down on a girl before I flight.

1972
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.360
Otherwise there's a chance you'll get cut way.
Elbows,
good call.
Yeah.

1973
01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.930
I think that you get caught by elbows because,

1974
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:29.470
because you've taken your head down past their waist and the head sacred and

1975
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:30.970
below the waist is considered dirt.

1976
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:35.260
So to go down on a girl is considered like really bad and really on bad luck.

1977
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:38.080
But um,
I've had 290 stitches.

1978
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:45.300
You've got 290 stitches.
That's a real number is rule number.
Great

1979
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.890
fucking good connection with your dog.
They stitch you up properly.

1980
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:54.430
I would have never guessed.
Um,
I've a rubber band in the back of my head.

1981
01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:59.470
There's pull the skin back.
It goes all the wrinkles yet.
That's crazy man.

1982
01:50:59.471 --> 01:51:03.340
290 stitches.
It's crazy that they won't let the girls touched the ring.

1983
01:51:03.341 --> 01:51:06.830
Like what do they do when they're fighting?
Uh,
on,
uh,
on the ad side one side,

1984
01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.560
they used to make the girls fight last,

1985
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.180
so there was no girl germs when the boys fought,

1986
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:16.410
so wow.
But before they couldn't touch the ring it at all.
So,

1987
01:51:16.411 --> 01:51:21.010
but everything's backup.
Jamie been up for awhile.
That's bizarre.

1988
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:24.250
That's so strange that they have such ancient,

1989
01:51:24.251 --> 01:51:28.900
ridiculous superstitious ideas when it comes to women.
Yeah.

1990
01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:33.430
Tom,
what happened then?
I'm doing the lady boy,
the lady boy,

1991
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:35.140
they used to fight a long painting.
Uh,

1992
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:38.650
they made a movie about her cause she used to save all the prize money and then

1993
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:42.050
she eventually saved up enough to get a sex change.
And then,
uh,

1994
01:51:42.190 --> 01:51:45.900
she started doing the homeowners.
Then it was all over the news because,
um,

1995
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:47.590
she started taking these injections,

1996
01:51:47.591 --> 01:51:50.530
then bait make boobs and then she wouldn't take your shirt off when she fought.

1997
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:55.570
And then she was a big spectacle.
She was making a main events in Japan,

1998
01:51:55.571 --> 01:51:57.670
but she stopped fighting and toiling and cause you didn't want to fight other

1999
01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.613
boys.

2000
01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:02.590
And now that paying like thousands of dollars just have dinner with her because

2001
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:06.520
she was such a freak.
Oh he was such a freak.
And then I eventually,

2002
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:08.800
after they said we've got to give you an injections gray,
the boobs,

2003
01:52:08.801 --> 01:52:11.830
make sure you want to say exchange first.
Uh,
before we chop it,
you doodle off.

2004
01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:15.310
And then they eventually dropped the doodle off and now a cheap flights chicks.

2005
01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.830
But because she's had all the hormones now she doesn't heat.
It was hot.
Well,
no,

2006
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.950
she's not as good as she was.
She's lost that testosterone.

2007
01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:28.630
Would you say she's a based,
just still fucking up in la?
Not as much.
Not as,

2008
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:31.250
not as much.
She's not as tough as she used to be.
Well she used to

2009
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.690
teach to be fucking totally different.
So she's allowed to fight females.

2010
01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:42.520
Yes.
Well she has this white females now.
Does she lose sometimes?
Wow.
But yeah,

2011
01:52:42.521 --> 01:52:46.100
I wanted the photo back or knows entirely and oh,
but back when

2012
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.790
<v 2>she was a heat,
of course he did.
Yeah.</v>

2013
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:51.350
He wouldn't fight me cause I was a little bit of a threat.
And so he'd fight.

2014
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.380
And then he got to the stage where he'd only fight Westerners or Japanese

2015
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:57.920
because,
uh,
they were a bit easier than other ties.
Wow.

2016
01:52:58.810 --> 01:53:02.780
So was that the first person that's become a transgender fighter over there?

2017
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:05.050
I believe so.
The most famous,
anyway,
he,

2018
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:07.450
and then he started going on catwalk models cause he had the,

2019
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:12.320
the Jiggle and he's Bra the Jiggle in his Bra.
Yeah.
Well the,
the gets a rap song.

2020
01:53:13.890 --> 01:53:17.110
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,
I fought him.

2021
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:21.110
He was not like worldclass before.
No,
it wasn't,

2022
01:53:21.111 --> 01:53:25.670
it wasn't a cost if the probably be class.
And how amongst women,

2023
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:30.700
what classes she now when,
when it was,
uh,

2024
01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.930
Jess before the operation it big,
big style in Japan main event,

2025
01:53:34.931 --> 01:53:38.180
a lot of big shows.
And um,
before the operation at one time they,

2026
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:43.220
they made her fight a female rock and roll wrestler that never thrown a punch

2027
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:47.270
before.
And they put boxing gloves and then she had them,
the,
the,

2028
01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.730
the face painted up in the wrestling stuff and had the guitar,

2029
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:55.100
they get up with the Lycra and then,
um,
the,

2030
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:59.240
the bill when the rest of their come charging across the transgender,

2031
01:53:59.241 --> 01:54:00.350
I grabbed it by the back of the neck,

2032
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:04.400
elbow to three times in the face and knocked her out unconscious for about two

2033
01:54:04.401 --> 01:54:06.440
or three minutes.
It didn't go well.

2034
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:11.380
And the dots before the white crew that like John was talking about,
um,

2035
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:16.300
I think she does the lipstick on the mirror there.
That's pretty cool.

2036
01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:21.740
Claims the head.
So she fought a woman that had never fought,

2037
01:54:21.741 --> 01:54:25.730
never done any training,
is beating the shit out of her and knocked her out.

2038
01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:29.420
The toy was about 66,
67 in the female wrestlers,

2039
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:34.100
about 80 or 90 kilos.
So looking at it,
it look fair.
One was big,

2040
01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:36.260
one was more when you had a flight,
when you had to wrestle,

2041
01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.840
but in a moist high match.
Oh,
it didn't go well.

2042
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:44.810
It was at Japan is Japan.
Japan's crazy way.
Japan's amazing.

2043
01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.260
They love it.

2044
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:51.920
They love doing that and they love having people who have never fought before

2045
01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:55.460
fight someone who's a world champion,
like they do weird shit like that.

2046
01:54:55.461 --> 01:55:00.110
They always did weird shit like that and pride and k one a dream.

2047
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:03.310
Bob Sapp and the hung main joy days.
Yeah man,
it's full.

2048
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:05.770
They had a lot of crazy matchups.

2049
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:09.380
Bob Sapp was a part of a lot of them but they love putting that guy up against,

2050
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:13.580
I mean they put Bob's hop against her.
Nesto hoost only beat him twice.

2051
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:19.030
I just with steroids just with steroids and a lot of momentum and mean.

2052
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:22.910
He's tough.
Look,
he took some fucking beatings.
I mean Ernesto,

2053
01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:27.140
who's some buyer and pride,
that was a good fight.
That was exciting.
Fucked up.

2054
01:55:27.141 --> 01:55:29.810
Noguera's NANC forever.
Oh really?
Pile driver.

2055
01:55:29.811 --> 01:55:31.580
He hit him with a pile driver in the first round.

2056
01:55:31.581 --> 01:55:36.581
He was 370 pounds with abs and Nogueira you know to this day is next.

2057
01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:38.840
Probably fucked up from that fight.

2058
01:55:39.230 --> 01:55:41.600
I remember a cro cop was the first person that the beat him in.

2059
01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:45.960
I'm Caitlyn came with that head kick.
Well,
he broke his eye socket.
Oh really?

2060
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:49.470
Yeah,
he,
uh,
he hit him with straight left and fractured his eye socket.

2061
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:53.280
It wasn't a headcase.
Okay.
Yup.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2062
01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:57.270
And then he went down and he crumbled.
Yup.
I remember that one.
Yeah,
he's his,

2063
01:55:57.271 --> 01:56:00.250
I was never the same after that.
He had like one of those weird highs after that,

2064
01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:01.081
you know,

2065
01:56:01.081 --> 01:56:06.081
some dudes get some dudes if their I gets their orbital gets so shattered that

2066
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:09.180
they have to repair it and do reconstructive surgery on it.

2067
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.700
Whatever you're doing is picking up on the microphone over there.

2068
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:15.660
Fellow you eat nuts,
put,
just push it away from me here.

2069
01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:19.320
Um,
but he,
uh,
he's,
I like,

2070
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:22.440
he had one eye that was always like really weird after that.
And because of that,

2071
01:56:22.441 --> 01:56:26.690
like he pretty much never was willing to take a punch after that.

2072
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.530
Like from then on,
like all of his fights,

2073
01:56:28.531 --> 01:56:31.140
he started like kind of laying down and he,
whenever he got tagged,

2074
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:34.890
fight was over.
There was no comeback money.
Fuck.
Yeah,
he did.

2075
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:39.160
He made a lot of money when he was a super star in Japan.
I mean they,

2076
01:56:39.170 --> 01:56:43.650
they made a,
a boob set.
Um,
I do.
They,
they,

2077
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:48.000
they did,
they,
they molded it and um,
they,
that would end the Japanese loved it.

2078
01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:49.320
They thought it was the greatest thing ever.

2079
01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:53.100
They molded it after his dick or just apparently says serious.

2080
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.810
He said that they had a book,

2081
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.880
they had a book of 50 bubs at facial expressions.
Here's Bob happy.

2082
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:03.310
He's,
Bob said he's raising one eyebrow and it was a,

2083
01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:08.340
it was like a number one seller.
He was the dulls the,
the bulbs.

2084
01:57:08.341 --> 01:57:13.200
That was a big deal.
That's so there are so strange and unusual,

2085
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:17.550
unusual culture.
You have any weird things that sold in Japan?
Uh,

2086
01:57:17.690 --> 01:57:19.610
it just always men crying.
That was the,

2087
01:57:19.611 --> 01:57:23.340
probably the weirdest thing when we used to go to a hotel,
uh,

2088
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:28.560
there'd be people that had came in the foil for like three or four days and

2089
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:31.710
every time we come in and lift that old sort of rush up to the thing,

2090
01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:35.040
trying to get pictures and signings and um,

2091
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:38.310
sometimes walking the street I had to at one mile guy,

2092
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:41.460
he just broke down in front of me and just had a ball and he's always,
yeah.

2093
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:42.383
And then um,

2094
01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:45.300
he pulled out of what Chad these pockets and I was coming to the hotel to give

2095
01:57:45.301 --> 01:57:47.010
you this.
I can't believe I'm meeting you on the street.

2096
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:50.790
He has this watch and just Yay.
It was bizarre.

2097
01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:53.340
And then women crying too.
Like women would cry all the time.

2098
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:56.280
That was sort of normal.
That's normal in pro wrestling circles.

2099
01:57:57.290 --> 01:58:00.920
If you follow American pro wrestler.
Yeah,
yeah.
They'll start crying.
Yo,

2100
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:05.250
if they meet you
fanatics,
it's just fanatics.

2101
01:58:05.251 --> 01:58:08.280
It's just Japanese fanatics are different than any other fanatic.

2102
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:12.300
They're very strange.
It's cool.
But it's,
it's,
it's fun.
It's a chip plan was fun.

2103
01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:16.320
I got to fight the 16 told him to say when,
um,
yeah,
it was,
it was awesome.
Well,

2104
01:58:16.321 --> 01:58:19.470
the culture is very bizarre when you're walking around there and you just walk

2105
01:58:19.471 --> 01:58:23.910
around Tokyo.
It doesn't feel like any other city anywhere else.
It's very modern.

2106
01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:26.970
It's very advanced,
very technologically advanced.

2107
01:58:26.971 --> 01:58:31.770
Like everything is like neon and big screens and high def,
this and that and,

2108
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:35.310
but everybody's like super polite.
Everything super clean.

2109
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:38.940
Sometimes you gotta three feds too where people would have silver hair and the

2110
01:58:38.941 --> 01:58:42.220
next time you got back everyone would be tane like ridiculous orange.

2111
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:45.280
Well the next time you go back it'd be something else where their head,

2112
01:58:45.281 --> 01:58:48.940
the the loud and I bet it was just,
yeah.
Bizarre.
Like I said,

2113
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.720
well that's one of the things that happen with fighting over there,
right?
Yeah.

2114
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:54.340
Fighting was a big fat.

2115
01:58:54.341 --> 01:58:59.020
It was only thousand people in Tokyo Dome Down to 40,000 people to pretty much

2116
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:02.250
disappeared from donor.

2117
01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:05.490
How do your heady I mess up and promotion that's got 90,000 people hideous.

2118
01:59:05.491 --> 01:59:09.260
Screw that up or k one doesn't exist anymore.
Right.
It's done.

2119
01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:12.670
Sort of coming back a little bit,
but it's not what it was.

2120
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:16.990
It'll never be what it was.
When was the last event?
Oh,
I think they,

2121
01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:19.330
they're doing a 63 killer now where,

2122
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:24.200
but they might only get 5,000 people compared to the old days of the forties in

2123
01:59:24.201 --> 01:59:28.090
the 60s in the hunter and the nineties so it's never going to have the same

2124
01:59:28.091 --> 01:59:30.640
appeal book.
Before.
When we used the fight Keller Mix,

2125
01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:35.740
I believe the promotion paid 50% and the TV paid 50% said between them,

2126
01:59:35.741 --> 01:59:37.420
they just made this super promotion,

2127
01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:41.830
so it was the big buildup on the TV and then all the graphics and the highlights

2128
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:44.530
and they fly to Australia.
They interview me.
I'm like,

2129
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:48.220
like the USC does say all the fans felt like they knew the fighter before the

2130
01:59:48.221 --> 01:59:50.430
bill rent,
so,
and that's,

2131
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:53.920
that's what the f the sports needs for the mortar in the kickboxing.

2132
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:55.960
It certainly does.
It's just,

2133
01:59:55.961 --> 02:00:00.961
it's so strange that in Japan that was like this insanely high level of

2134
02:00:01.541 --> 02:00:02.410
popularity.

2135
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:07.860
And then just the Bob sat and the earnest hoose and the Peter Urges.

2136
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:12.510
There'd be on all the game shows and then there'd be an old will,

2137
02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:14.480
a fortunate in Japan sorta stole.

2138
02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:18.010
And that was just celebrities that were not just fighters but celebrities.

2139
02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:22.740
And then that's all just vanished.
Now what's replaced it?
Um,

2140
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:26.260
there's no combat sports that are particularly popular there right now.

2141
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.880
They will,
the pride pride in pride was so massive and one was so massive.

2142
02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:32.770
And what's in the,
I'm not sure simmer.

2143
02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:38.520
The UFC got totally schooled in Japanese business when they bought pride.

2144
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:40.240
Yup.

2145
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.160
Because they really didn't understand how much different Japanese business is

2146
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:47.770
than American business.
Like one of the things they did was,

2147
02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:50.130
it's really kind of interesting how they did it.
The,

2148
02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:54.490
the Japanese would talk about selling pride.
They'd be like,
you know,

2149
02:00:54.491 --> 02:00:57.460
we would like to sell pride.
And they go,
okay,
let's,
let's sit down.
Let's talk,

2150
02:00:57.461 --> 02:01:00.130
let's go over numbers.
And so they'd make this big announcement.

2151
02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:01.790
The UFC sitting down with prior,

2152
02:01:01.791 --> 02:01:05.110
they're talking about buying pride and then they go,
we're not going to sell.

2153
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.990
And they would,
they would sit down,
they'd get,

2154
02:01:06.991 --> 02:01:09.890
they'd reach some sort of an agreement and then not going to tell.

2155
02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:13.540
I went for a long time.
They're like,
what the fuck is going on with these guys?

2156
02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:15.430
Like they say they're going to sell and they don't sell.

2157
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:16.810
But what they were doing was,

2158
02:01:16.930 --> 02:01:19.810
I mean they had Vandelay Silva come over and he got in the cage with chocolate

2159
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:22.390
Dell and they mean mug each other.
We're not going to sell.

2160
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:27.750
And what they did was they hyped up pride through the UFC and they made pride

2161
02:01:28.150 --> 02:01:32.580
more exciting by pretending that they were going to sell prior to the UFC by

2162
02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:34.330
pretending they were gonna bring fighters over.

2163
02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:36.640
And fighters are going to fight in pride.
And they had chocolate.

2164
02:01:36.641 --> 02:01:38.620
Dell go over and fight in pride.
Remember that?

2165
02:01:38.621 --> 02:01:41.480
And you know rampage Jackson and chocolate del fought.

2166
02:01:41.481 --> 02:01:46.250
And then chuck came back to the UFC and then finally they said they were going

2167
02:01:46.251 --> 02:01:51.230
to sell pride and they sold it for $65 million.
Okay.

2168
02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:55.370
The UFC got it.
And once they went through all the paperwork,

2169
02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.050
all the monies exchanged hands,

2170
02:01:57.350 --> 02:02:02.330
they realized they'd bought bullshit because all the contracts were invalid.

2171
02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:06.140
There were all bullshit contracts,
there were all w w didn't hold up.

2172
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:10.220
So like they didn't have faith or they didn't have a lot of its stars like,

2173
02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:13.640
and they had a video library,
that's all they had.

2174
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:17.750
They got a video library for like $65 million.
Then it gets even crazier.

2175
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:21.440
So they say,
okay,
we're going to run pride in Japan,

2176
02:02:21.441 --> 02:02:25.130
we're going to maintain the office in Japan and we're gonna use these pride

2177
02:02:25.131 --> 02:02:27.110
employees.
We're going to build up pride,

2178
02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:28.820
we're going to start running plot pride in Japan.

2179
02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:31.460
So these time they'd start trying to do that.

2180
02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:35.540
And the people that were working for them started dream.

2181
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:39.380
So they're working for them,
they're working for the UFC and,

2182
02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.530
and all the while they're putting together this dream promotion.

2183
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.820
And so then they went off and started dream and then you know the UFC,
he's like,

2184
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:51.530
ah,
we're just going to close up shop.
So now all they had from that $65 million,

2185
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:55.910
I think they were going to try to sue Japan.
Like the Japanese businessmen.

2186
02:02:55.911 --> 02:02:57.740
It's old to them.
It was a big deal for a while,

2187
02:02:57.741 --> 02:02:59.750
but then they dropped that shit too.

2188
02:03:00.170 --> 02:03:04.580
And now all they have is like the best of pride that's on like Fox sports one.

2189
02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:06.310
I mean that's the revenue source and it's,

2190
02:03:06.311 --> 02:03:09.620
it's also like something they show on on a fight pass.

2191
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.890
Like you could watch all the old prides on fight pass,
which is Kinda cool.

2192
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:17.280
But it's like,
fuck man.
It's just,
they're just,
it's just different.

2193
02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:19.970
She's very different over there.
It's crazy.

2194
02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:24.020
Did you make good money fighting over there?
Uh,
it's that of the ball rolling.

2195
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:29.240
It's that a definitely got me out of them.
Yeah,
it helps.
It helps that.

2196
02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:31.330
And then once I started getting,
no,

2197
02:03:31.331 --> 02:03:33.740
you Katelyn money then is it sort of snowballed,

2198
02:03:33.741 --> 02:03:35.030
which helped me get to where I am now.

2199
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.300
Did they give you it all in cash like they do with the,
uh,

2200
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:42.490
the MMA fighters is one of those ones where as a month wait in between
paychecks.

2201
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.250
Yeah.
You'd fight and,
okay.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?

2202
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.840
Well that's one of the things,
it's that fuck Bob Sapp over.
Bob Sapp was um,

2203
02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:54.320
they had some sort of a contract dispute and they tried to get him to fight

2204
02:03:54.321 --> 02:03:57.530
without a contract in the main event of one of their events.
Is it in Holland?

2205
02:03:58.130 --> 02:04:00.530
I don't think it was.
It was a Japanese event.

2206
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.780
I know he walked out of one of the events in Holland and paid it,

2207
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:05.860
which was in the crowd after a few bees and he ended up putting his hand out,

2208
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:10.070
said,
oh fine,
I'll save the shitter.
And he did it.
He got,
but he took it.

2209
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:14.060
He took what?
He had to borrow someone else's shorts.
[inaudible]

2210
02:04:15.450 --> 02:04:19.790
after a couple of beers.
Yeah.
It's hilarious.
Peter Arts man.

2211
02:04:19.791 --> 02:04:23.500
You want to talk about a dude who's fought the best of the best forever.
Yeah.

2212
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:26.300
He's the King God.
That guys had some crazy fights.

2213
02:04:26.301 --> 02:04:30.440
I watched a highlight reel of his the other night on Youtube and you forget,

2214
02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:33.650
you forget how many high kick Kaos that guy had got,

2215
02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:36.800
I bet to say the same thing as the cause critical ups got the reputation for the

2216
02:04:36.801 --> 02:04:39.600
head.
But then you look back at Peter Hertz,
there's Cro,

2217
02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:42.750
cop has a reputation for head kicks in MMA.
Yep.

2218
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:48.020
But in kickboxing you mean there's no comparison between cro cop and Peter

2219
02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.680
Hertz.
Yup.
But it's also cro.
Cop had a really good style for MMA.
Yeah.

2220
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:55.860
Because he's like this explosive sprinter type dude.

2221
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:57.870
Like his style for kickboxing.

2222
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:02.580
He might've not had the best style to compete against like the Anesto who sir

2223
02:05:02.581 --> 02:05:04.200
the the best kickboxer guys.

2224
02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.990
Like they were like a little bit more tactical than him.

2225
02:05:06.991 --> 02:05:09.900
They had a little bit more classic kickboxing training.
You know,

2226
02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:13.800
he's over in Croatia,
but he's just a savage,
you know,

2227
02:05:13.801 --> 02:05:18.540
and just had lightening fast kicks that left high kick band.
Jesus Christ.

2228
02:05:18.890 --> 02:05:20.240
He was a good guy for winning.

2229
02:05:20.241 --> 02:05:23.040
Went to pray because we had someone that we could relate to that was doing so

2230
02:05:23.041 --> 02:05:24.570
well in MMA.
It's like,
yes,
everyone,

2231
02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.930
everyone cheated for critical because he was one of us pro that the going over

2232
02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:33.030
well you got to see with Cro cop what happens when you get a really high level

2233
02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:36.570
kickboxer and they learn how to sprawl and they learn how to stay on their feet.

2234
02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.310
Everybody was getting fucked up.

2235
02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:43.190
I mean there was a period of time when cro cop was in his prime where mean

2236
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.240
before he lost to fade or,

2237
02:05:45.241 --> 02:05:49.680
I mean he was just lighting people on fire.
You know,

2238
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:52.400
you look at some of his head kick victories and prime,
they had,

2239
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:56.190
this dude's had no business standing up with him.
They had no business.

2240
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.580
It was like they were blue belts and he was like a ninth degree black belt and

2241
02:05:59.581 --> 02:06:02.670
striking.
He would just fucking head kick everybody do oblivion,

2242
02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:06.130
but he didn't have that kind of sexy success in kickboxing.
Yeah.

2243
02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.290
It's sort of like what we were talking about earlier,
where when you're fighting,

2244
02:06:10.291 --> 02:06:13.650
when you see guys that are fighting and kickboxing and Muay Thai and you're

2245
02:06:13.651 --> 02:06:18.270
seeing the highest level expression of that art of,
of striking art,

2246
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:21.900
like the yachts and Clive's the bull cows.
Yup.
John Wayne Pars.

2247
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:27.850
Who was you think,
um,
your toughest opponents?
Have you ever fought a,

2248
02:06:27.851 --> 02:06:30.720
you guys think Les Johnson Class?
I fought him three times.

2249
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:34.840
The first time I fought him he,
um,
he kicked me in the head,
uh,

2250
02:06:35.070 --> 02:06:39.070
the second round and then like last night when I told him I,
Brendan,

2251
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.490
I couldn't remember the rest of the fight went the distance,

2252
02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:43.330
but I have no idea what happened off of the head kick.

2253
02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:47.140
And then the second time we fought was the funnel of the contender ratio,

2254
02:06:47.141 --> 02:06:48.330
like reality TV show.

2255
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:52.560
And he dropped me around one and then drove me to get me on to,
and I did okay.

2256
02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:55.740
Three,
four and five.
But um,
yeah,
he,
he's a beast.

2257
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:58.670
In the third time I fought was down in Melbourne and I was done.

2258
02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:01.940
I was just lucky enough to the,
the punches with,

2259
02:07:01.941 --> 02:07:05.880
it's the Australian judges scored a little bit high than the round kicks in and

2260
02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.430
if it was entirely,
and I think I would've lost,
but because it was in Australia,

2261
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.590
I was lucky to get the single victory I room today.

2262
02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:14.640
That's interesting though because the,
it's kind of arbitrary,

2263
02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:18.630
like they decide that the punches don't score as much in Thailand.

2264
02:07:18.631 --> 02:07:21.720
Like the only way you can score,
I don't think you mentioned on this podcast,

2265
02:07:21.721 --> 02:07:24.690
but you talked about it yesterday and the fight pass that a guy could like box

2266
02:07:24.691 --> 02:07:28.440
the shit out of a tie fighter and ty was kicking his arms.

2267
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:29.940
The tie fighter would win.
Yeah,

2268
02:07:29.941 --> 02:07:33.390
well I felt bull Kaylee in Jamaica and they had three Lupini judges,

2269
02:07:33.391 --> 02:07:36.160
they and then everyone that watches the phone,
I get a lot of emails

2270
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.550
<v 3>to this day that just watch it on Youtube and say,
ah,</v>

2271
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:40.060
I think you'd beat balk at that time.

2272
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:43.890
But because it was the toy influence with the judges in the toy scoring that

2273
02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:44.711
that's how I lost.

2274
02:07:44.711 --> 02:07:47.590
But it would've been nice to have that one victory over board cows.

2275
02:07:47.591 --> 02:07:51.280
Well that would really sort of shot,
cause he's,

2276
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:54.520
he's a man now he's meeting more famous [inaudible] even though I think you got

2277
02:07:54.521 --> 02:07:57.960
single,
I would beat book and I've never fought.
Well he,
yeah,
he still,

2278
02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:01.530
so I got to see a chance to see him fight once in Los Angeles.
Three,

2279
02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:04.450
I forget the name of the promotion,
but they had a really high level,

2280
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:06.820
a Artem Levon fought a book.

2281
02:08:06.821 --> 02:08:09.610
How far but to see him fight live was yeah,

2282
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.940
he doesn't hit very hard compared to you singular and he's very fast,

2283
02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:17.620
but you guys away,
it's very powerful.
And South Pole.
So you had single,

2284
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:21.140
I'd bring in Goodson guys punching in defenses worlds.

2285
02:08:21.210 --> 02:08:24.920
The end of tours he's punches crazy or is um,

2286
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:29.310
both cows realizing that fast left kick in fast team.
So it'd be,

2287
02:08:29.311 --> 02:08:31.670
so it's one of those Floyd packy,
our fights,
the yard,

2288
02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:34.080
single adverse balking or fight.
But I,

2289
02:08:34.081 --> 02:08:37.090
I'd put my money if they ever did happen to meet,

2290
02:08:37.150 --> 02:08:40.340
is it too late for those guys to fight a different promotion?
So I,

2291
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:41.201
different promoters,
sorry.

2292
02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:46.000
So too much support politics that learned on Bob Arum donkey never going to

2293
02:08:46.001 --> 02:08:48.970
happen.
God dammit.
And then borecas on your contract now where he's,

2294
02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:51.970
he's not allowed to fight other ties apparently.
Yay.

2295
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:55.600
He's got taken over by seeing how beer they've taken every,
as management in,
um,

2296
02:08:55.630 --> 02:08:58.660
they've made some,
some contract where we can find out the toys anymore.

2297
02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:01.360
That's ridiculous.
How can we can't fight it other times.

2298
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:03.940
I think it's got to the stage now where he's become a brain.

2299
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.800
He's not just a fighter.
He's a,
he's a brand.
He's the,
he uh,

2300
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:11.200
he sponsored by sing her,
um,
Thai Airways,
um,
uh,

2301
02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:15.720
Thai tourism.
Uh,
he's the face of the Thailand for the Moitai.

2302
02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:18.870
It's amazing how that happened.
He's Ah,

2303
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:20.590
because he got ripped off by his old manager.

2304
02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:25.980
He had about 200 fights for a pauper book and then he won the k one two or three

2305
02:09:26.351 --> 02:09:30.790
times to two times when $50,000,
$100,000,

2306
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:35.050
both times.
And then,
um,
he kept asking his trainer,

2307
02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.020
so it has my money go,
oh,
don't worry.
I've put in the bank.

2308
02:09:38.050 --> 02:09:39.160
I'm an investment with Voya.

2309
02:09:39.490 --> 02:09:43.150
And he went out and bought five houses for himself and then board the manager,

2310
02:09:43.151 --> 02:09:46.570
the manager,
the mom of four.
And then he said,
okay,
where's my money?
He said,
ah,

2311
02:09:46.571 --> 02:09:51.370
you have nothing you had,
he had a pillow and a suitcase of clothes after,

2312
02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:55.690
after 200 fights to show for his name.
Wow.
So he quit.

2313
02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:59.590
He quit the camp and he said,
Betsy,
I'm done.
And then,
um,

2314
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:04.090
the manager was going to sue him.
I went to court and I told a,
yeah,

2315
02:10:04.091 --> 02:10:07.960
it was big time managers going to sue him because he's still one of these 50%.

2316
02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:12.520
If,
if walk out,
if both,
if Bork care went to fight for Japan again,

2317
02:10:12.710 --> 02:10:15.400
he was still making big money and he still won and he's cut even though he was

2318
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:16.930
ripped them off,
even though he's ripping them off.

2319
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.910
He the entirely and the manager was still bright.
He still had the rights.

2320
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:23.560
It was his horse.
Remember how we're talking about the horses?
That's still,

2321
02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.113
that's his property.

2322
02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:28.480
[inaudible] property book didn't have any claim to all the money that he got

2323
02:10:28.481 --> 02:10:33.230
ripped off from.
Nothing.
Whoa.
Thailand.
Thailand.
Okay.

2324
02:10:33.231 --> 02:10:37.070
So he leaves and then somebody else manages say,
boy cow.

2325
02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:41.510
He declared statement.
Remember the fight night,
any thought the king in and said,

2326
02:10:41.511 --> 02:10:43.850
you know,
I've fought for my country,
a fight for the king and

2327
02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:47.780
holding your hands up like you're holding a photo.
He did.

2328
02:10:47.781 --> 02:10:48.960
He was holding a photo of it,
king

2329
02:10:51.090 --> 02:10:55.370
calling him up and then I think he and Nancy,
his retirement.
So he said,
I'm done.

2330
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:58.170
I'm just gonna Open Moon Gym.
And then,
uh,
the,

2331
02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:02.930
I believe seeing how BIA they felt,
they had a friendship with him and I said,

2332
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:06.170
hey,
we're going to take your now wings will counter sued.

2333
02:11:06.171 --> 02:11:07.400
They got the money to do whatever.

2334
02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.670
And then Bork Ella had permission to all of a sudden they start fighting again.

2335
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:14.030
And then,
um,
they have a lot of influence.

2336
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:17.000
So the entire tourism come in and said,
oh,
we'll give you a hand as well,

2337
02:11:17.001 --> 02:11:19.880
and that all these other sponsors.
And then all of a sudden walking out,

2338
02:11:19.881 --> 02:11:24.650
I was driving a BMW and energies are in place and it is a good face for like,

2339
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:29.060
well where does he live?
He's live still in Thailand.
He's where?
He's at camp now.

2340
02:11:29.530 --> 02:11:31.400
He's in Thailand.
In Thailand.
It is on a farm.

2341
02:11:31.401 --> 02:11:34.190
I was saying with the farm pictures,
he's got a massive gym.

2342
02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:35.570
Well that's a great story.

2343
02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:40.760
That this terrible tragedy in this horrible turn.
Good.

2344
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:43.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're still young.
I mean how old is he?

2345
02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:48.290
I must be nearly early thirties probably.
So that age where it's like almost,

2346
02:11:48.291 --> 02:11:49.260
you know,
he's got enough time.
Yeah.

2347
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:53.210
It was the full rocky story and his whole position positions taken away and then

2348
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:56.180
they come back and now to be to where he is is pretty cool.

2349
02:11:56.210 --> 02:12:00.720
And he's the only fighting Westerners.
Like how's it go?
Yeah,
Western is and um,

2350
02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:05.390
uh,
Asians but no toys.
That's so weird.
Why no ties.
Dangerous.

2351
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:09.880
Dangerous.
He could lose.
Lose.
He's a brand.
Oh,

2352
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:12.470
I didn't think of it that way.
I thought it was a nationalistic thing.

2353
02:12:12.810 --> 02:12:14.840
You don't want to beat a lot of Brazilians.

2354
02:12:14.841 --> 02:12:17.010
Do not like to fight Brazilians as the,

2355
02:12:17.011 --> 02:12:19.870
the handful of toys that are there that are quite,
quite dangerous as well.

2356
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:23.490
And then could take away that and then that reputation and when flight is

2357
02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:26.510
disappeared,
uh wow.
Whew.

2358
02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:31.220
That's a terrible little velvet present to be living in it,
you know,

2359
02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.050
that's,
does that make him lose faith in,

2360
02:12:34.130 --> 02:12:37.490
in Thailand or in the only Thai community?
He's a god.
He's a god.
Doesn't matter.

2361
02:12:37.491 --> 02:12:38.850
As he going every time he fights,

2362
02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:43.130
there'll be 20,000 people in a park somewhere cheering his name.
How am I any,
uh,

2363
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:45.720
uh,
just for instance,
like the,
we were talking about before,

2364
02:12:45.721 --> 02:12:50.030
how if you can do a promotion yet people will drive for hours to be amongst,

2365
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:53.600
to be amongst the promotion.
And then,
um,
I think he's on top commercials.

2366
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:58.010
They might even be on the side of buses and billboards.
And he's,
he's the man.

2367
02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:01.940
He's like,
he,
he's the,
what could he be?

2368
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.130
He's the Michael Jordan of Thailand.

2369
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:08.180
So does yachts and Clyde's sit around looking at him on billboards and go,
damn,

2370
02:13:08.181 --> 02:13:12.770
motherfucker.
Pretty Mellow.
I daresay he would,
he'd have to.
You'd have to damn.

2371
02:13:12.771 --> 02:13:15.910
Cause those are the two big names that people talk about in Muay Thai.

2372
02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:17.750
In America.
I mean,
I don't know what it's like over there,

2373
02:13:17.751 --> 02:13:22.520
but when you talk to people who train my tie that are fans of the sport,

2374
02:13:22.670 --> 02:13:25.020
those are the two big names.
Yeah.
Bull care.

2375
02:13:25.021 --> 02:13:26.920
I had the opportunity to fight for Kaitlin,

2376
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:30.790
which blueys career up before that and he was just fighting on channel seven.

2377
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.970
Just this,
I'm a

2378
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.813
<v 2>small time.</v>

2379
02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:36.360
And then got in front of the Caitlin walled scene and then he blew up.

2380
02:13:36.361 --> 02:13:38.640
And then you had single,
I never had the same opportunities as Bork,

2381
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:41.970
how I did four yards and Clive's finding for lion fights.
Right?
Yeah.

2382
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.070
And they're putting that on access TV.
It's,
it's,

2383
02:13:44.610 --> 02:13:48.630
it's just not that much a coverage.
Yes.
It's too bad.

2384
02:13:48.631 --> 02:13:51.470
Cause Access TV has amazing fights in lion fight.
You know,

2385
02:13:51.471 --> 02:13:54.740
like they have Kevin Ross.
Yes.
Who's a American that does very well.

2386
02:13:54.741 --> 02:13:56.760
It's one of their champions over there.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2387
02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:00.300
Really exciting to watch.
Fight.
Yeah.
Kevin is cool.
He's so good.

2388
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.450
And it's more tie.
It's such pure Moyie Thai,
you know what I mean?

2389
02:14:03.451 --> 02:14:05.130
It's not like a a boxer,

2390
02:14:05.131 --> 02:14:09.000
a kickboxer like there's some guys like no disrespect cause he's a very good

2391
02:14:09.001 --> 02:14:12.420
fighter.
Like a Wayne Barrett is a very good fighter,
but you know,

2392
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:15.720
you see like he's got more of a sort of like a boxing style and then he's adding

2393
02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:19.410
the Moitai techniques to it.
Whereas you see Kevin Ross like just looks like,

2394
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:20.830
you know your classic yes.

2395
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.510
Thai style of fighter given sort of like the vision of me.

2396
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:28.860
He's going and lived and breathed and then everything and he's power to make

2397
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:33.600
that,
that transition.
So his whole life consumed of the,
yeah.

2398
02:14:33.601 --> 02:14:37.440
I love lion fights,
man.
I,
I went to see that live live in Vegas.

2399
02:14:37.441 --> 02:14:39.570
I really hope that promotion takes off.
Yes,

2400
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:42.570
it'd be good for the sport and it'd be so good.
Well the,
this is the only one.

2401
02:14:42.571 --> 02:14:46.110
I mean there's,
there's,
that's the big promotion in America.

2402
02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:51.090
That's the promotion with TV coverage is showing full Muay Thai.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2403
02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.700
So you got brought in to work with George.

2404
02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:57.000
You got brought in to work with George Saint Pierre before,
which fight was it?

2405
02:14:57.090 --> 02:15:00.090
Hendrix.
Hendrix.
Yeah.
And what was that camp like and what was it like?

2406
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:02.340
Like how did you guys make this connection?
Uh,

2407
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:06.560
so I had the opportunity to come to Canada and I did a seven seminars.

2408
02:15:06.590 --> 02:15:10.180
We'll all around Canada and there was about three days left and wade scheduled

2409
02:15:10.190 --> 02:15:11.580
before it had the flood back to Australia.

2410
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.830
And then the gentleman the boat may have,
I said,
hey,

2411
02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:15.750
would you like the trouble to Montreal?

2412
02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.040
And I get a choice that I make George a holy shit.
That'd be pretty cool.
Get up,

2413
02:15:20.041 --> 02:15:24.660
get a photo with George and a Facebook status and they'd be amazing.
So we drove,

2414
02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:29.460
we drove to him Montreal and I said,
Hey,
um,
Flores was so nice.

2415
02:15:29.461 --> 02:15:33.150
He goes,
I know he,
well,
I'm happy to put you up in a hotel for tonight.

2416
02:15:33.151 --> 02:15:35.940
And then tomorrow is moist high spine day.
Would you let this spa,

2417
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.550
a few of the boys said,
Holy Shit,
that'd be pretty cool.

2418
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:43.190
So the next day I'm bought all my gear and then,
uh,
we're,

2419
02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:47.310
we're stretching out.
And say,
hi,
John Wayne,
you go and spy George.
I was like,

2420
02:15:47.311 --> 02:15:51.770
whoa.
And then,
uh,
I,
I touched George's,

2421
02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:56.340
his glove,
and then I was like,
this little school girl.
Oh my God,

2422
02:15:56.341 --> 02:15:58.400
I can't believe it was Rogers with George it up movement.
It's like I did,

2423
02:15:58.410 --> 02:16:02.040
we used today exactly the same I think with you today.
And then,
uh,

2424
02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:05.520
and then the first 10 seconds I was so afraid,
or George's Jab.

2425
02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:08.140
And then I've waited,
waited,
and then he's throwing something.

2426
02:16:08.141 --> 02:16:11.340
I Cannady through something else I can under that.
Um,
he threw a jab,

2427
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:14.360
I come over the top and I placed my shin across his neck and I just left it

2428
02:16:14.361 --> 02:16:19.020
there,
just long enough for the whole gym to stop in and stay.
And then,

2429
02:16:19.021 --> 02:16:22.710
um,
and then George's eyes lit up.
And then,
uh,

2430
02:16:23.010 --> 02:16:26.380
and then I chased him from one side of the cage,
the sort of the cage.
And,
uh,

2431
02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:30.260
it was pretty,
I felt pretty good.
And then a next round,

2432
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:34.960
<v 3>hey,
all right,
John Wayne,
or you got a Rory.
So I sparred Rory and as a high shit,</v>

2433
02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:39.100
um,
I said the jury,
Rory,
I,
hello,
how are we going to go?
Like,

2434
02:16:39.101 --> 02:16:42.130
cause I thought he was a pretty sight psycho and now he was really cool.

2435
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:44.440
He was really nice guy and then we spot him and um,

2436
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:46.100
they really well against Roy's,

2437
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.570
well I bank with George so that did really well against George again.

2438
02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:52.990
So I took some photos and then,
um,
I thought that was,
that was it.

2439
02:16:52.991 --> 02:16:55.670
And I thought we were done.
And then about two months later,

2440
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:59.260
whereas gave me a call and he said,
hey,
George is getting ready for Hendrix.

2441
02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:00.340
What about two months?

2442
02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:03.550
Any chance you want to come back to Montreal and train George personally?

2443
02:17:03.551 --> 02:17:07.620
From what I,
it's a holy fuck.
Yes.
Wow.
Sorry.

2444
02:17:07.650 --> 02:17:10.750
I jumped on the plane.
George picked me up at the airport.

2445
02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:14.880
He took me to the hotel.
He said,
oh,
this is the,
the hotel and uh,

2446
02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.860
Saint Catherine's,
uh,
this is where I like the heat.
Freddie Roach.
It's like,

2447
02:17:17.861 --> 02:17:21.730
Holy Shit,
this is big time.
Yeah.

2448
02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:23.680
George picked me up every morning.
We go train,

2449
02:17:23.681 --> 02:17:27.980
we'd go eat lunch and water together and every,
every day for two hours after,

2450
02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:30.820
after a week he said,
hey,
do you want to go to New New York?

2451
02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:33.490
New York's like my second hometown.
I'd love to show you around.

2452
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:36.730
We'll go and meet John Donahue that then,
uh,
here.
Um,

2453
02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:40.450
so we went to New York and then we did some training at the Gracie Academy
there.

2454
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:45.640
And,
uh,
I got to meet Phil nurse and then,
uh,
it was,
it was really cool.

2455
02:17:45.641 --> 02:17:49.210
Everyone was real you training Jujitsu or know just training.
I was training,

2456
02:17:49.211 --> 02:17:53.150
I was Georges Moitai trainer personally for two weeks.
Uh,
for us it's,

2457
02:17:53.170 --> 02:17:55.690
you don't have to do any classes or any cinema,
cinema seminars.

2458
02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:59.050
Well it just got to train joy's personally for two weeks.
So basically everyday,

2459
02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:02.710
everyday,
everyday we'll do pet pads in a spa and just have fun.

2460
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:06.730
Did you do anything differently the way you train him then you would train any

2461
02:18:06.731 --> 02:18:10.390
more Thai fighter?
Uh,
we had to get ready for the Hendricks who was a south pole.

2462
02:18:10.450 --> 02:18:14.230
So I become Hendrix when we sparred.
So I'd throw this,
um,

2463
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:18.430
this overhand right and trying to rush him along and then less,
sorry.
Yes,

2464
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:22.270
very good.
Very cool.
Um,
that's why you're on the big bucks.

2465
02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:29.740
So yeah,
I've become a Hendrickson when we spot.
And then,
uh,

2466
02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:34.620
I had George just doing basic stuff as you would have fire fighting any Sao

2467
02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:35.710
Paulo.
But,
uh,

2468
02:18:35.711 --> 02:18:40.711
unfortunately I think for nurses at my stall didn't compliment Phil's store.

2469
02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.230
Phil was more about the spinning kick in the jumping elbow and the,

2470
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.450
and the spinning something or other.

2471
02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:50.010
And I just want him to keep George one stall just to keep it inside.
Right.

2472
02:18:50.011 --> 02:18:54.910
You just wanted it to be like more conservative.
Yeah.
And then,
um,

2473
02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:00.290
uh,
so after two weeks,
it was still 12 weeks before the fight happened.

2474
02:19:00.291 --> 02:19:04.550
So George went,
probably went back to these stall because you'd say hard,

2475
02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:06.640
you've got to stay with someone that whole time.

2476
02:19:06.641 --> 02:19:09.790
You can't just train them for a couple of days and hope that they stay that way.

2477
02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.890
Um,
and then,
so I got back to Australia and this is cool.

2478
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:18.820
So this lady,
she,
she sends me this email,
she goes,
I'm just want to know,

2479
02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:22.690
are you going to go to Georges fight?
And I said,
oh,
unfortunately,
no.

2480
02:19:22.691 --> 02:19:24.220
If I go on the team,

2481
02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:26.440
they're going to have to kick someone off and I don't want to cause any

2482
02:19:26.441 --> 02:19:29.720
controversy.
I'm the,
I'll just share for George in Australia.
She goes,
no,
no,
no.

2483
02:19:29.721 --> 02:19:31.410
You deserve to be there.
Um,

2484
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.400
I want to pay for your plane ticket to go and which George fight live.

2485
02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:38.730
You deserve to be there.
Who's this lady?
It just some lady from,

2486
02:19:38.850 --> 02:19:43.250
from Facebook,
some cash and then,
uh,
wow.
So she just flew you.
So she goes,

2487
02:19:43.251 --> 02:19:47.480
what would you like Iowa window?
And I say,
Holy Shit,
this is really happening.

2488
02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:49.740
She goes,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
I'll,
I'll send you over there.

2489
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:52.520
You deserve to be there.
And then she goes,
good news.
Um,

2490
02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:54.920
as I was looking for flights,
they deal came up for MGM.

2491
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:56.870
So I've got your three nights at the MGM also.

2492
02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:02.170
So you just got to rock up and I'm going crazy.
It was so cool.
And George,
no,

2493
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:06.560
you were common.
Uh,
no,
I don't think so.
Well,
I seen I then,
um,
um,

2494
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:09.620
Goya from Mexico that trains at Albuquerque.
He,
um,

2495
02:20:09.621 --> 02:20:13.160
he seen I was there and he asked me if I could walk him to the scales on the

2496
02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.040
night and then I got to see George in the back room and he's looking at me,

2497
02:20:16.041 --> 02:20:20.240
how the hell did you get that?
But that's fine.
It was pretty cool.

2498
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:23.210
And that's when we met.
Yeah.
So that's how I got your tickets.

2499
02:20:23.470 --> 02:20:26.290
That's how you got it as a fight.
So everybody hooked you up.
Yes.
Yes.

2500
02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:29.570
It was amazing.
Um,
and then,
yeah,

2501
02:20:29.571 --> 02:20:33.200
watching George fight from the grand stands for the complete opposite fight to

2502
02:20:33.201 --> 02:20:34.610
what we're training for.
He fought,

2503
02:20:34.970 --> 02:20:38.330
he fought Hendrix like he was gonna Fight Orthodox fighter instead of a southpaw

2504
02:20:38.331 --> 02:20:40.850
fighter.
So he's turning outside,
outside,

2505
02:20:40.851 --> 02:20:44.060
left kicks and set it inside the right kicks in.
Big Body kicks up.

2506
02:20:44.061 --> 02:20:47.550
We're working on,
but um,
he still,
but I thought he won.
It was a very close fight.

2507
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:51.260
I thought going into the fifth round,
it was anyone's fight.
It was two,
two,

2508
02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.890
and the fifth round.
I believe George just slightly enough to get the edge.

2509
02:20:55.640 --> 02:21:00.220
So that's my theory anyway.
But you didn't enjoy,
um,
the way he was doing it.

2510
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:02.720
You'll get it bother you.
Yeah,
it did a little bit.

2511
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:05.700
Consider all we worked on and then how he fought was um,
yeah,

2512
02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:06.680
a complete contrast.

2513
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:11.480
So I think he could have won a lot easier if we had stuck to our game plan.

2514
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:17.000
But um,
yeah,
I I was too far out of camp to,
to make that game plan stick.

2515
02:21:17.390 --> 02:21:21.440
I did another film nurse wiped a lot of spinning techniques.
Like what,
what yeah,

2516
02:21:21.441 --> 02:21:23.270
you're kind of spinning techniques as he,
uh,

2517
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:27.890
he's more about the spinning elbows in the APP would elbow and the spinning back

2518
02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:32.780
kick.
He's more about the,
the,
the crowd pleasing moves instead of the,

2519
02:21:32.781 --> 02:21:36.860
the sticking to the basics.
That's interesting.
I wouldn't have thought that.

2520
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:39.410
I thought he was like real traditional Moitai

2521
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:44.900
more flashy,
more flushing.
But he,
he's the one that gets the,
the,

2522
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:49.580
the crowd standing up.
He,
when,
when people do he stuff it's,
it's the,

2523
02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:52.190
it's the eye.
Yeah.
That's pretty awesome.
Oh,
I see where it's at.

2524
02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:55.570
I'd rather punch someone in the face really hard with the jab,
you know,

2525
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:58.840
would spinning Becky if that makes him.
So I'll,
I'll keep,

2526
02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:03.380
I'll keep everything low key so I can win instead of risking will you have a

2527
02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:06.330
real power based style,
which was really unusual.
I've,

2528
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:10.100
I've worked with a lot of different guys over the years that uh,

2529
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:13.770
training MMA fighters or Trey Moy Tai and your style was,

2530
02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:18.440
is completely unique.
Like this,
your style of standing,
your style,

2531
02:22:18.441 --> 02:22:21.770
like your fucking,
that power jab you have is ridiculous man.

2532
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:26.130
It's really the only guy who I've ever talked to that had a similar philosophy

2533
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:30.120
<v 2>but slightly different was bas Rutten bas route.
And also believes that your,</v>

2534
02:22:30.121 --> 02:22:33.510
your jab should be as hard as you left as your right hand.
You want to be.

2535
02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:36.860
He's a fucking psycho going here.
Best written stories say so.
Uh,

2536
02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:41.310
you have a bus route,
the bus route and story,
these knee lane.

2537
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.650
And then I was with the family and then,
uh,

2538
02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:46.350
I've going to go to the toilet and I've seen best with his family.

2539
02:22:46.770 --> 02:22:51.510
And now I was around a UFC shit.
And then,
uh,
end of the quote on quote on my oil,

2540
02:22:51.511 --> 02:22:55.680
I could see that he seen me and I was sorta this little thing,

2541
02:22:55.681 --> 02:23:00.050
this little sparrow,
this little,
it's a little annoying little bug.
That shit.

2542
02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:03.360
How long ago was this?
Ah,
maybe two or three years ago.
Oh,

2543
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:05.580
ignoring little bug that happened to have 10 world titles.

2544
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.300
I had the UFC shirt on,
so I stood at like,

2545
02:23:09.301 --> 02:23:11.920
Doug was bowls and then I finally got the courage.

2546
02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:15.900
They got up and asking you for a photo and then,
um,
he said,
oh,
I'm just a minute.

2547
02:23:15.901 --> 02:23:18.210
Just a minute.
I have to buy my son and the ice cream first.
I'll come back.

2548
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.970
And I felt this big,
I felt like a little midget.

2549
02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:22.890
And then I'm sure why not be come back over here.

2550
02:23:22.891 --> 02:23:27.210
I'll get that photo with the now.
And I've,
I felt he didn't know who I was.

2551
02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:30.660
I introduced myself,
but he's just what I just the polite small,
took the photo,

2552
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:33.070
wished me on my way and then,
uh,

2553
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:36.210
and then he came to Australia and then he did it seminars here and the guy that

2554
02:23:36.211 --> 02:23:38.960
organized seminars got him to give me a call.
Hey,
talked to John Wayne,

2555
02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:42.900
he's bit of,
and then I told him this story and it was,
it was pretty funny.

2556
02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:47.490
But yeah.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you say your name to him?

2557
02:23:47.491 --> 02:23:50.060
I told anyone I shut him.
John Wayne par.
Uh,

2558
02:23:50.370 --> 02:23:53.130
he gave me a polite,
so smaller,

2559
02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.980
you're going to be a polite small loss route and out of the loop.
Yeah.

2560
02:23:58.050 --> 02:24:01.620
He was the first guy to bring like real technical striking to MMA.
He's amazing.

2561
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:04.470
He's the main bachelor's,
the main him.

2562
02:24:04.471 --> 02:24:09.471
And then Maurice Smith was the one who brought like real hard level more tie to

2563
02:24:09.841 --> 02:24:11.070
the UFC.
Yes.
You know,

2564
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:15.540
like you watch a Maurice's leg kicks were just fucking brutality.

2565
02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:18.180
He gives them,
the minute I touch up to 30.
Yes.

2566
02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:19.920
Maurice was a bad motherfucker in his day.

2567
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:25.160
He want to fight recently at 50 he's 50 and he won a MMA fight by head Keck.

2568
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:30.840
Whoa.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
I mean,
he's still going at it,
man.

2569
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:34.710
It's amazing.
Yeah.
Maurice just decided,
I took a few years off.

2570
02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:38.720
He decided to fight one more time and,
and that was MMA.
Yeah.
You ever married?

2571
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:43.800
He fought some dude who I had no booze,
no other way,
you know?
But I mean,

2572
02:24:43.801 --> 02:24:47.130
hey mean he's 50 you don't know.
You know,
I mean,

2573
02:24:47.131 --> 02:24:50.690
there's guys that have come back after all those years and she,
you know,

2574
02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:53.310
Maurice was in great shape.
He did it the right way.
He was,

2575
02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:56.570
he was always known for his discipline and his cardio.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,
well,

2576
02:24:56.730 --> 02:25:00.900
when we're talking about pioneers,
just before,
he was definitely one of the main,

2577
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:03.150
oh yeah,
they brought the sport up.
Well,

2578
02:25:03.151 --> 02:25:06.750
he was one of the first guys that showed how important cardio wasn't MMA and

2579
02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:09.510
when he fought Mark Coleman,
because Mark Coleman came out,

2580
02:25:09.511 --> 02:25:13.500
I'm like off fucking bat out of hell on the first round,
but more.
He's just so,

2581
02:25:13.501 --> 02:25:18.180
it showed poise and discipline and stay calm and then after,

2582
02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:21.450
you know,
the first round was over and call them and start a gas out.

2583
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:25.270
Then more he starts laying those heavy leg kicks.
You hear that,

2584
02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:31.200
that fucking disgusting baseball bat to meet sound.

2585
02:25:31.850 --> 02:25:36.480
Oh yeah.
It's just,
it's been very interesting to see the rev,

2586
02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:38.150
the evolution of a,

2587
02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.430
the standup striking in MMA now for a guy like you standing on the outside and

2588
02:25:42.431 --> 02:25:46.230
watching.
This has got to be really interesting for you too,
because you know,

2589
02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:51.240
coming from that pure striking background and seeing all the things that MMA

2590
02:25:51.401 --> 02:25:55.120
fighters and you know,
in,
in the standup aspect,
w would they do that?

2591
02:25:55.130 --> 02:26:00.130
They do wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
What works in my sport doesn't work in MMA.

2592
02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:03.910
You can't throw body kicks really in MMA otherwise and catch it and take you

2593
02:26:03.911 --> 02:26:05.920
straight to the end.
There's a lot of guys winning by body kick.

2594
02:26:05.921 --> 02:26:08.080
Now a lot of guys are stopping guys,

2595
02:26:08.081 --> 02:26:11.890
especially with that left kick to the liver man that left kick to the body when

2596
02:26:11.891 --> 02:26:13.230
they're standing the south pole position.

2597
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:15.250
You're seeing Liotta Machita one by that.

2598
02:26:15.251 --> 02:26:18.490
There's a lot of guys are winning by that kick the Steven Seagal tapes in the

2599
02:26:18.491 --> 02:26:23.040
face.
No,
that ones,
that's rare.
But man,
that fucking shit works.

2600
02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.940
You know,
it's weird.
Tepes very rarely knock anybody out in my tie tapes in MMA.

2601
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.040
Yeah.
Well we were talking,
we'll do a few guys do,

2602
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:33.370
but we were talking about it last night that the stance is so different in MMA

2603
02:26:33.371 --> 02:26:36.330
and you're still worried about the take downs and you know,
the grasp,

2604
02:26:36.450 --> 02:26:37.390
the grappling aspect.

2605
02:26:37.391 --> 02:26:40.480
You might open the door to front kicks and things along those lines.

2606
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:44.650
And it's my,
um,
one of my main weapons in.

2607
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.830
I wouldn't be able to throw it how the as much when I kind of have it to America

2608
02:26:47.831 --> 02:26:49.840
to try and learn a little bit of MMA.
I had,
um,

2609
02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:54.070
I had a flight back in 2017 it's a gentleman gluteny been yellow and then I got

2610
02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:57.790
over here and then everything like I tried to do.
That's how I kind of do that.

2611
02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.530
You kind of do more than three or four punches,

2612
02:26:59.531 --> 02:27:01.150
otherwise you're gonna get taken down.
You kind of buddy,

2613
02:27:01.151 --> 02:27:03.610
keep not catching you take it in as a coach is telling.
Yeah.

2614
02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.160
And they've got to the stage where it's like,
what's your coach?

2615
02:27:06.161 --> 02:27:10.390
Who's the coach telling me that?
Uh,
Thomas Denny.
Hmm.
Okay.
Yeah.

2616
02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:14.800
So he's a good dude.
You should have been with a guy like for us,
you know,

2617
02:27:14.801 --> 02:27:17.260
I get the garlic for us.
Would have figured out what to do with looking back.

2618
02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:21.550
Looking back,
I was,
I was just,
um,
he was closest to my wife's family,

2619
02:27:21.551 --> 02:27:26.380
so it just seemed,
makes sense.
I'm actually,
uh,
actually chatting with them.

2620
02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.450
The guys down at,
uh,
Orange County.
I know Orange County.
Uh,

2621
02:27:32.390 --> 02:27:37.150
uh,
uh,
no,
no.
Uh,
uh,

2622
02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.800
what's,
um,
Eric Paulson,
Paulson,
lot of crazy grappling.

2623
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:45.650
He's got a lot of like cat trust as a Fewster drive.
Uh,

2624
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:47.030
so I to hear a funny story.
Sure.

2625
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:54.010
So I,
um,
I meet Cub Swanson.
Cub Swanson is cool dude,

2626
02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:58.280
and they're hanging out.
And then my first day,
Eric Paulson,
steam,

2627
02:27:58.830 --> 02:28:03.400
uh,
it's more tidy.
Okay.
And I'm the,
I'm the new guy.
I had no nothing,

2628
02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:06.930
no one knows who I am.
And then it's like I post,
I was like,
okay,

2629
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:10.900
more taco has put your gear on guys.
Okay.
So,
uh,
Josh Net,

2630
02:28:10.930 --> 02:28:15.470
you spa this way.
And he points to me.
And uh,

2631
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:19.540
so I always thought,
and I'll move it around inside kick,
Jab,

2632
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:23.120
and then Josh story,
I'm like out and you know,
I mean,
boom,
boom,
boom.

2633
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:28.010
And I'm going again.
He throws get cool,
Eh,
and then,
and then,

2634
02:28:28.090 --> 02:28:33.080
uh,
he's a big dude.
He's a big dude,
sorry,
fearing for my life.

2635
02:28:33.081 --> 02:28:36.830
Just,
just tapping a light to the room.
And then,
uh,
we do two rounds.

2636
02:28:36.831 --> 02:28:41.360
After two rounds,
he takes his glove off and he throws it across the room.

2637
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:45.230
He takes his Shin Pad off,
throws it across the room,
he packs his bag,

2638
02:28:45.231 --> 02:28:47.720
he storms out,
and then,
uh,

2639
02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:51.290
they go into Tokyo the next day to fight on the New Year's Eve,
um,

2640
02:28:51.350 --> 02:28:54.500
pride tournament.
I'd,
I forget who it was against.
Um,

2641
02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:58.820
and then about a week passes,
um,
Josh loses his point.

2642
02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:03.580
I get a phone call from Eric Paulson about three or four days later,
once,

2643
02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:07.360
once I get back and I said,
oh,
I'm a hey,
this is Eric,
you going,
um,

2644
02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:12.460
I just want to let you know that we blame you on Joshua's loss because he was

2645
02:29:12.771 --> 02:29:15.050
fine right up until he spied you.

2646
02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:18.980
And then some kid that had never seen before owned him in the sparring and took

2647
02:29:18.981 --> 02:29:21.860
away all his confidence.
So when he got to Japan,
he was a mess.

2648
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:26.690
And this is a true story.
I kid,
you know,
well first of all,

2649
02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:31.691
how ridiculous or they to take a guy like you where they don't always just that

2650
02:29:32.331 --> 02:29:34.780
new guy in the gym.
It's like,
oh,
I used to buy him a,
okay,

2651
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:36.440
that's ridiculous to do that.

2652
02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:40.550
That's the one of the problems with high level MMA as opposed to like high level

2653
02:29:40.551 --> 02:29:40.971
boxing.

2654
02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:45.800
Could you imagine Floyd Mayweather preparing for a fight and not knowing the

2655
02:29:45.801 --> 02:29:48.250
training partner training partner goes in,

2656
02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:52.790
it turns out to be some fucking unbeatable world champion boxes of mop and fucks

2657
02:29:52.791 --> 02:29:55.310
him up right before our big fight.
Yeah,
you'd never would happen.

2658
02:29:55.370 --> 02:30:00.370
And 80 80 he like he'd versus 130 kilo goy and then he's fighting on pride,

2659
02:30:01.011 --> 02:30:04.910
which he shouldn't.
Yeah,
it didn't make sense to me,
but I found it quite amusing.

2660
02:30:04.911 --> 02:30:09.800
Thing is kind of amusing,
but I mean I can see it from Josh,

2661
02:30:09.801 --> 02:30:12.940
his point of view too.
We had no idea.
No,
no,
no idea.
I mean,

2662
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.190
imagine you're expecting just some average guy in the gym that's smaller than

2663
02:30:16.191 --> 02:30:21.110
you and then you just run into some multiple time world champion.

2664
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:24.680
It just happened I think,
I think,
sorry,
the day before might've been Jujitsu Day.

2665
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:27.220
So the day before I had,
there was my first ever,

2666
02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:29.150
I just know that they had brought my finger,
but it's like,

2667
02:30:29.151 --> 02:30:33.050
so you were there getting strangled.
So I went in,
I think cubs,
God.

2668
02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:38.360
And then Eric's like,
all right,
go,
go where?
He goes,
try and do something to him.

2669
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:41.530
I don't know what to do.
And then,
um,

2670
02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:45.140
I'm putting them on getting tapped every 30 seconds and the next day is more

2671
02:30:45.141 --> 02:30:48.260
tidy and all of a sudden I put my Cape on,
I take my shirt off.

2672
02:30:48.261 --> 02:30:53.000
I've got a big s on my chest,
I turn into superman in,
um,
yeah,
I light up,

2673
02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:57.320
uh,
Josh Barnett and then all of a sudden,
yeah,
he's very cranky.
Yeah.

2674
02:30:57.321 --> 02:31:01.100
I would imagine that's one of the things that a lot of fighters who are a really

2675
02:31:01.101 --> 02:31:04.790
good at one style have an a chuge issue with his learning.

2676
02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:05.860
Like a lot of wrestlers,

2677
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:08.960
they never really developed the ability to strike because they would start

2678
02:31:08.961 --> 02:31:11.810
sparring and they would get fucked up and they'd be like,
I hate this.

2679
02:31:11.811 --> 02:31:15.980
I just want to take these guys down.
That's what I do.
Or a lot of Jujitsu guys,

2680
02:31:15.981 --> 02:31:18.560
they didn't want to learn how to kickbox are a lot of strikers.

2681
02:31:18.561 --> 02:31:20.100
They just didn't want to learn Jujitsu.
It's

2682
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.780
<v 1>just like we were saying,</v>

2683
02:31:21.781 --> 02:31:24.330
you're a world champion and then you would go in there and you wouldn't know

2684
02:31:24.331 --> 02:31:27.660
what to do and he didn't like it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2685
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:31.380
<v 3>It wasn't mine.
And then the whole thing,
for me personally,
as well as,
um,</v>

2686
02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:34.980
in between someone,
another gentleman,
his legs,
it's okay,
push the hips,

2687
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:40.400
<v 1>wish my hips.
Then it's only one way.</v>

2688
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:42.620
I kind of fuck you.
Way To victory.

2689
02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:50.660
Yeah,
I know.
It's weird.
Well,
also I'll dude sweat in your mouth sometimes.

2690
02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:53.070
That's sometimes people mounting you in the

2691
02:31:55.670 --> 02:32:00.260
rise position things rough north.
South,
north,
south.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2692
02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:02.720
Tom.
And then my brother was telling me one of the camps,

2693
02:32:02.721 --> 02:32:05.430
he went to one of our boys,
they're gone.

2694
02:32:05.431 --> 02:32:09.530
What had dip in his mouth while he's training.
I'm not saying his name.

2695
02:32:10.310 --> 02:32:14.480
Kevin Random.
Is it American or American wrestling camp?

2696
02:32:14.481 --> 02:32:18.290
Was it Kevin?
Random middle of someone?
I'm not sure it was Randleman had dip.

2697
02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:21.730
Okay.
But um,
yeah,
they um,

2698
02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:25.250
had declined and notice like during a little private lesson with them and the

2699
02:32:25.251 --> 02:32:30.170
dip was Cisco.
She's just fucking before I started.
So disgusted.
I know it was.

2700
02:32:31.310 --> 02:32:36.050
Yeah.
Well that's the thing about MMA as opposed to like we said,

2701
02:32:36.051 --> 02:32:36.920
La Boxing,

2702
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:41.150
like their camps are incredibly organized and they bring in people to mimic a

2703
02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:42.620
very specific opponent.
Yes.

2704
02:32:42.621 --> 02:32:45.850
They would never have a situation where they just have a class and oh,

2705
02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:50.480
a world class fighter is just taking a class with a bunch of strangers that

2706
02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:53.990
still exists in MMA.
You know,
and some people think it's a good thing,
you know,

2707
02:32:53.991 --> 02:32:57.620
some people think it's,
it's,
it's,
it's cute.
Yeah.
But I just think,

2708
02:32:57.621 --> 02:33:00.950
you know what you were saying before about George preparing for Johnny
Hendricks,

2709
02:33:00.951 --> 02:33:04.340
very specific style and this is the things that will work best against this very

2710
02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:07.940
specific stance and style.
I mean,
I think that's the future.

2711
02:33:07.941 --> 02:33:11.760
I think when you're dealing with the highest level athletes and combat sports in

2712
02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:12.633
MMA,

2713
02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:16.700
you're going to have to have these really meticulously designed training camps.

2714
02:33:16.770 --> 02:33:17.870
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well

2715
02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:20.360
<v 3>for me,
um,
I watched the,
the,</v>

2716
02:33:20.370 --> 02:33:25.370
the [inaudible] and they're coming up and they spend so much time hitting the,

2717
02:33:25.561 --> 02:33:27.560
the,
the Toya and with the hammer.

2718
02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.200
And then they got the robes on this and they're,

2719
02:33:30.201 --> 02:33:32.390
they're doing all the sprints with the parachute,

2720
02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:36.500
but they come through a straight jab.
Yeah.
Ooh,
those hours spending,

2721
02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:40.550
getting fit when you could've spent in the gym.
Just perfecting that,
that stall.

2722
02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:43.520
And then I'll get back to Thailand and that the ties don't lift weights.

2723
02:33:43.521 --> 02:33:46.370
All they do is hit pads,
run kickback like cavemen.

2724
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:50.510
And it's been for 2000 years.
But it's there.
There's so,

2725
02:33:50.511 --> 02:33:54.740
everything's so perfect and their bodies are ripped up.
Men,
I think the myself,

2726
02:33:54.741 --> 02:33:57.920
I'd rather look like a tie,
um,
fully ripped and fit than a,

2727
02:33:57.921 --> 02:34:02.150
than a half body builder trying to,
trying to pretend I'm a rock,

2728
02:34:02.310 --> 02:34:03.470
I'm a wrestler with them.

2729
02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:06.190
<v 1>There's a lot of fighters that believe that there's like sort of a point of</v>

2730
02:34:06.191 --> 02:34:08.980
diminishing returns when it comes to strength and conditioning that there's,

2731
02:34:09.010 --> 02:34:13.960
but there's a balance that has to be achieved when you're dealing with
grappling,

2732
02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:16.640
when you're dealing with a takedowns and the,

2733
02:34:16.641 --> 02:34:20.950
the ability to explode and shoot a double a double leg take down.

2734
02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:21.761
It's like kicking me.

2735
02:34:21.761 --> 02:34:24.790
I think there's certain amount of strength and conditioning is necessary.

2736
02:34:25.210 --> 02:34:26.740
I think it's different though.
It's striking.

2737
02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:30.260
I think what's striking efficiency of movement,
you know,
the uh,
the,

2738
02:34:30.261 --> 02:34:34.000
the also your body becomes accustomed to those techniques.
So you have,

2739
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:38.350
with more efficiency of movement,
you have more,
you lose,
use less energy.
Yes.

2740
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:39.820
And you don't get exhausted.

2741
02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:43.000
Whereas you're seeing a lot of these guys that are in great shape,

2742
02:34:43.050 --> 02:34:46.960
great strength and conditioning programs.
They're fit,
they're physically strong.

2743
02:34:46.961 --> 02:34:47.860
They have a lot of muscle,

2744
02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:51.400
but they don't have a lot of physical efficiency in their movements.

2745
02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:54.640
When it comes to striking and there they're emphasizing strength.

2746
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:59.560
You see them walk and fucking everything is like wide punches.

2747
02:34:59.561 --> 02:35:04.510
It doesn't,
it doesn't look as fluid.
Whereas if you're watching like,
you know,

2748
02:35:04.511 --> 02:35:07.360
like yachts and Cli or like you or like bull cow,

2749
02:35:07.361 --> 02:35:12.110
you're seeing like a really relaxed,
like the execution is very relaxed.
Yes.

2750
02:35:12.250 --> 02:35:13.150
Yeah,
yeah.

2751
02:35:13.151 --> 02:35:18.090
And the excess muscle mass that it makes you more tired as well.
Hmm.

2752
02:35:18.250 --> 02:35:21.740
Where's your rather be like lean grey hound.
That's um,

2753
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:25.750
but then you got these motherfuckers would take you down,
you know,

2754
02:35:25.751 --> 02:35:29.170
and you can't get back up and you get exhausted from the tank downs and you know

2755
02:35:29.171 --> 02:35:30.760
that grappling is a different,

2756
02:35:31.210 --> 02:35:34.690
it's so different when you add the grappling because like with the way George

2757
02:35:34.691 --> 02:35:39.250
beat Bj Penn was so clever because Bj was a very good striker and he's very,

2758
02:35:39.251 --> 02:35:41.110
he's wicked with his hand speed.

2759
02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:44.710
So George has tied his ass up and made them exhaust his arms.

2760
02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:48.910
He just tie and Bj was not known for a guy who concentrate on strength and

2761
02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:52.750
conditioning until really after those fights,
after the fight with George,

2762
02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:53.770
this when he got,

2763
02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:59.500
when he got down with the Mirena bitches and the Marinovich uh,
era of um,

2764
02:35:59.890 --> 02:36:01.610
when he was um,

2765
02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.960
at his best I think was when he was doing maybe why don't I think he's bright.

2766
02:36:07.421 --> 02:36:11.020
I think he fought George after that.
I might be wrong.
The best.

2767
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:16.110
Bj Penn though was Bj Penn who went through that Mark Marinovich a strength and

2768
02:36:16.121 --> 02:36:19.660
conditioning program cause it was just this unbelievably brutal.

2769
02:36:19.810 --> 02:36:21.970
They would show it on the countdown shows.

2770
02:36:21.971 --> 02:36:24.790
You just see all the shit that he was doing and he was talking about he couldn't

2771
02:36:24.791 --> 02:36:28.030
even hold his kid at night and he going to be so sore and exhausted.

2772
02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:29.680
His body was just broken down.

2773
02:36:29.681 --> 02:36:33.580
But Mark Burnett Bitch put him in like this insane.
He had it.

2774
02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:37.210
He was famous as like a strength and conditioning guy because his son was like

2775
02:36:37.211 --> 02:36:41.140
his prodigy and his sun kind of went crazy cause he disciplined him so hard.

2776
02:36:41.141 --> 02:36:43.360
He was so like into training on,

2777
02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:47.470
but as his son was like a football prodigy from his dad's strength and

2778
02:36:47.471 --> 02:36:52.471
conditioning programs and he instilled this program on Bj Penn that he just was

2779
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:57.800
fucking unbelievable.
But what happened out of it,
it was you got this Bj,

2780
02:36:57.801 --> 02:37:01.480
you didn't get tired and Bj Penn had so much scale.

2781
02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:04.690
He had so much talent and so much heart and determination,

2782
02:37:04.691 --> 02:37:07.180
but all of a sudden he has this never ending gas tank,

2783
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:11.020
which you never saw from Bj Penn before.
So in MMA man,

2784
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:15.740
it's like sometimes it's necessary and sometimes it's like trying to find that

2785
02:37:15.741 --> 02:37:16.574
balance though.

2786
02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.900
You have how much skill training and how much strength and conditioning because

2787
02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:22.460
all the skill training in the world,

2788
02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:25.640
if you get exhausted because you're wrestling with a guy who was a shooting on

2789
02:37:25.641 --> 02:37:29.450
you and taking you down all the time,
then I'm going to stay in.

2790
02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:33.850
It's almost like MMA has too much going on.
Yeah,
yeah.
It looks like the on the,

2791
02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:36.790
on the road to use Shay's,
it looks like someone's take their training here,

2792
02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:39.290
then jumping in the car for four hours and something over there.

2793
02:37:39.291 --> 02:37:43.250
Then they back over here for two hours remaining in the pool.
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2794
02:37:43.310 --> 02:37:45.740
It's almost like there's too much going on in a fight too.
It's all,

2795
02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:49.340
but that's also what makes it so crazy.
It's like the be the best at that.

2796
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:51.440
You know,
you be the best at that and,

2797
02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:54.590
but one of the things you're seeing is the guys that are the best,

2798
02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:57.560
they're good at certain things,
you know,
like,

2799
02:37:57.890 --> 02:38:01.580
like you don't see Anderson Silva shooting double leg take downs.

2800
02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:06.230
Mountain Guy Spinning for armbars mean he's caught a few submissions in his day,

2801
02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:09.980
but usually catches him after he fuck somebody up.
Like Dan Henderson.

2802
02:38:09.981 --> 02:38:12.050
He fucked him up and then he got his back and choked him.

2803
02:38:12.350 --> 02:38:16.000
Or like Chael Sonnen with Chelsea on and just fucked up and late in his garden.

2804
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:17.090
He caught him with a triangle.

2805
02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:21.510
But what you're used to seeing him do his kickboxing guy.
Yes.
Yeah.

2806
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:25.460
It's a rumble.
Johnson is perfect example.

2807
02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:29.180
He's one of the top contenders at two oh five yeah,
I could see him guillotine.

2808
02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:31.370
Anybody.
He's not,
he's not triangle and anybody.

2809
02:38:31.430 --> 02:38:34.550
He's stepping forward and blast and people would punches and kicks.

2810
02:38:34.551 --> 02:38:39.551
I mean that's what he does and it's almost like to be like the very best is

2811
02:38:39.621 --> 02:38:41.680
really hard to be good at everything.
You know,

2812
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:44.840
usually a few guys that are dangerous everywhere.

2813
02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:47.930
Like Anthony Pettis is so weird because he's dangerous everywhere.

2814
02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:52.520
He's dangerous standing up and then he catch him on his back and he's fucking

2815
02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:54.320
catching you in Armbar it's weird.

2816
02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.500
It's like he's one of the few guys who just dangerous everywhere.

2817
02:38:57.590 --> 02:39:01.190
Serone Serona's dangerous,
dangerous off his back,

2818
02:39:01.191 --> 02:39:03.540
which is one of the reasons why so willing to kick.
Yup.

2819
02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:08.170
Not worried about getting taken down.
You know,
his triangle has armbar all his,

2820
02:39:08.171 --> 02:39:12.260
his guard games,
vicious fight with them.
Most jury,

2821
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:16.310
unbelievable.
Oh Dude.
The end when he's throwing those kicks his legs.

2822
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:18.680
But that the first 30 seconds when he went to take a,

2823
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:21.800
when miles went to the taking down and he turned it into a shoulder,

2824
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:26.540
shoulder look,
that was like,
Whoa,
that's pretty high level right there.

2825
02:39:26.541 --> 02:39:28.730
He was no joke.
He can do everything.
He's,

2826
02:39:28.731 --> 02:39:30.950
I mean I think he's only got a brown belt in Jujitsu,

2827
02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:35.300
I think like on paper or whatever,
but the way I,
if I see him move,

2828
02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:40.460
it's black belt level.
He's very razor sharp on the ground,
but again,

2829
02:39:40.461 --> 02:39:43.730
it's like how many of those guys can do everything?
Like what would,

2830
02:39:43.731 --> 02:39:45.830
what would happen if Johnny Hendricks is fighting off his back?

2831
02:39:45.831 --> 02:39:48.500
Do you think Johnny Hendricks has a triangle?
Do you think?
You know,

2832
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:51.500
how many times is Robbie Lawler caught a guy in an arm bar and I was like,

2833
02:39:51.501 --> 02:39:54.710
the guys like some of the really best guys in the sport,

2834
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:58.940
they're good at a certain aspect of it and then they just concentrate on their

2835
02:39:58.941 --> 02:40:02.270
strengths and they use that and they get through and they win.

2836
02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:06.770
I wonder what's going to be,
what,
what MMA striking is going to be like five,

2837
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:07.640
10 years from now.

2838
02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:10.700
I wonder if you're going to see it ever achieve a level that you're seeing in

2839
02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:13.800
like pro Moy Tai.
Yeah.
And then I

2840
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.140
<v 2>do you see yourself working with more MMA fighters?</v>

2841
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:19.650
I have say I really enjoy working with everyone and doing,

2842
02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:22.160
moving around train different people.
Um,

2843
02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:24.540
and then meeting celebrities like yourself and then,

2844
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:28.710
and doing stuff with you even today was so much fun.
I wish she lived close.

2845
02:40:28.711 --> 02:40:32.610
I dealt with every week.
That was fun,
man.
I learned a lot today.
It was really,

2846
02:40:32.611 --> 02:40:36.240
I mean it was a short amount of time,
but especially that style of a,

2847
02:40:36.241 --> 02:40:39.390
of punching and movement and in combination with kicks and knees.
Yeah.

2848
02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:43.860
I believe I'll let the offer when it comes to,
um,
just,
just,
uh,
broadening,

2849
02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:49.040
broadening people's idea of how to execute a different strikes.

2850
02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:53.370
I want to try and maximize the power edit every single thing that throws it

2851
02:40:53.390 --> 02:40:57.810
meant whether it be a hooker uppercut or near a hickey.
I want to try and um,

2852
02:40:58.620 --> 02:40:59.453
uh,

2853
02:41:00.510 --> 02:41:04.140
destroy anything that a layman would it be for him?

2854
02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:05.790
Thawing nose face nick,

2855
02:41:06.090 --> 02:41:10.110
that's a very different approach than say like a modern boxing approach or like

2856
02:41:10.111 --> 02:41:13.410
you seeing like guys like in corners they'll come back to the corn and the corn

2857
02:41:13.411 --> 02:41:15.210
would say just touch him,
touch him with a jab touching.

2858
02:41:15.211 --> 02:41:16.044
When there's touching with that.

2859
02:41:16.290 --> 02:41:20.780
There's a lot of like guys maybe like Nick Diaz is a good example was throwing

2860
02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:23.640
like a lot of punches.
He just touching 30,
70,

2861
02:41:25.210 --> 02:41:28.440
but I will say that an intimidation factor.
Also,
if I hit you hard,

2862
02:41:28.441 --> 02:41:31.410
you don't want to eat by me again.
I want to just keep chipping it.

2863
02:41:31.430 --> 02:41:34.260
If I hit you with a jab that hurts.
Okay,
I'll go.
I just felt off.

2864
02:41:34.261 --> 02:41:35.460
I hit you with Lakey.
Okay.

2865
02:41:35.461 --> 02:41:39.150
I want to make that really also it gets to the stage where I don't,

2866
02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:42.000
I mean you hit the nail and then once I know I'm in your head,

2867
02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:44.310
then it makes it a lot easier for me to stop picking things.

2868
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.670
Is there a different approach to fighting in a Moitai fight?
Words,

2869
02:41:47.671 --> 02:41:51.660
three rounds with no grappling as opposed to MMA,
which is five rounds with,

2870
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:56.520
with grappling and that maybe that sort of style of like so much fucking energy.

2871
02:41:56.521 --> 02:42:00.450
Any HUD hard to maintain conditioning for that Michael Johnson last night.

2872
02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:03.960
Fuck yeah,
that was amazing.
Damn.
He looked good.
That was awesome.

2873
02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:07.170
And he maintained the whole three rounds to 15 minutes.
It just crazy.

2874
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:09.880
Every Michael Johnson man,
he's really looking good these days.

2875
02:42:09.890 --> 02:42:10.830
I was cool last night.

2876
02:42:10.831 --> 02:42:14.820
It was probably his most impressive performance cause Edson Barboza was a very

2877
02:42:14.821 --> 02:42:19.620
good striker.
He just attacked,
attacked like right from the beginning.
Yup.

2878
02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:22.140
He's a wrestler.
Yeah.
So another guy just,
you know,

2879
02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:25.140
it's just great athlete who is immersed himself.
Yup.

2880
02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:26.970
Have you ever trained with Henry,

2881
02:42:26.971 --> 02:42:30.980
who's the guy who's the head coach of the coach of the Black Zillions?
No.

2882
02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:33.450
Be Interesting to see a hoof does.

2883
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:37.770
He's got a lot of guys down there that he's really improved and in big ways.

2884
02:42:37.771 --> 02:42:42.210
He's got that Dutch style.
The Holland Moit are Holland kickboxing style.

2885
02:42:42.690 --> 02:42:45.690
He's a teaching these guys showing big improvements too.

2886
02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:49.280
And a lot of the fighters.
Yup.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm uh,

2887
02:42:49.290 --> 02:42:52.560
I'm here for just the one week and I'm lucky to do a few seminars around town.

2888
02:42:52.561 --> 02:42:54.810
So here are the seminars.
If people want to go like what?

2889

They've got a lot of guys coming.

2907
02:44:02.201 --> 02:44:04.180
So is there a website where people can go there,

2908
02:44:04.181 --> 02:44:07.410
listen to this and didn't get a chance to write it down?
What does it sit on?

2909
02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:11.960
We'll just put it on John Wayne Pas a Twitter fan page.
Okay.

2910
02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:15.730
John Wayne par fan page on Facebook and John Wayne Parks Twitter account.

2911
02:44:15.850 --> 02:44:18.970
All the dates will be up on there and all the times and all that stuff.
Yes.
Yes.

2912
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:22.840
Beautiful.
Anything else brother?
Um,
if you get an opportunity,

2913
02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:25.420
I'll have a documentary that's I've just released on Youtube.

2914
02:44:25.421 --> 02:44:27.470
It's called blessed with venom.
Uh,

2915
02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:30.280
it's a 90 minute documentary when it was at least in Australia.

2916
02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:35.380
It had a two weeks in the cinemas and then the company that put it out for me,

2917
02:44:35.930 --> 02:44:38.060
uh,
once it was finished,

2918
02:44:38.061 --> 02:44:42.400
they sorta lost my phone number and I didn't hear anything from him for like

2919
02:44:42.401 --> 02:44:45.490
three or four years.
So now I thought,
you know what,
fuck you,

2920
02:44:45.491 --> 02:44:49.120
I'm putting it on Youtube for free.
So if anyone wants to see it,
it's a,

2921
02:44:49.121 --> 02:44:50.620
it's a lost your phone number.

2922
02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:54.280
Literally lost your phone number or they just stop going and stop calling me.

2923
02:44:54.281 --> 02:44:57.770
They were going to do DVD sales.
I don't know what happened to that base.

2924
02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:01.090
I was getting messages from people in Brazil and we've just watched the

2925
02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:04.750
documentary and Mizzou with them.
Subtitles.
Absolutely amazing documentary.

2926
02:45:04.751 --> 02:45:07.930
And I'm thinking where's all this money going there actually wouldn't have gave

2927
02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:12.530
it to the Brazil TV for free.
Uh,
I didn't,
I didn't make 1 cent from,

2928
02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:13.600
from the documentary,

2929
02:45:13.601 --> 02:45:17.110
so I thought it got to the stage with these people just so nobody else has to,

2930
02:45:17.170 --> 02:45:21.100
oh,
I don't want to let them know.
Hey there.
But they know who they are.
Yeah.

2931
02:45:21.101 --> 02:45:25.810
But it was amazing.
I can't thank them enough for making the documentary.

2932
02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:29.050
So,
but now it's on youtube for free.
So if anyone wants to watch it,

2933
02:45:29.051 --> 02:45:32.530
it's called blessed with venom and it's going to Thailand visiting my old camp,

2934
02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:37.180
uh,
interviewing yards and glow and other tiny opponents.
I'm San Angelo.
Uh,

2935
02:45:37.181 --> 02:45:42.160
the traditions about going to finding it penis stadium and just lots of

2936
02:45:42.310 --> 02:45:44.740
highlights of old flights.
I watched it this morning.

2937
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:47.500
It was pretty fucking bad ass.
Hey,
it's really cool.
Nice.

2938
02:45:47.501 --> 02:45:50.050
And then that'd be cool having a documentary on you like that.
Yeah.

2939
02:45:50.051 --> 02:45:53.350
And when you still alive too and when I'm not bullshit.

2940
02:45:53.370 --> 02:45:56.070
That was when it was released in cinemas to the,

2941
02:45:56.071 --> 02:46:00.340
the first night there premiered it had a red carpet and we had a 450 people in

2942
02:46:00.341 --> 02:46:04.600
the cinema.
And then I play my mom,
my mom and my Nana and the family together.

2943
02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:10.180
And it was uh,
the,
my,
my head was three stories high.
He was,
he was such

2944
02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:13.730
<v 2>a,
such a cool buzz.
Wow.
One of those things where you pinch yourself,</v>

2945
02:46:13.731 --> 02:46:16.640
you can't believe this is happening.
So pronounced on Youtube.
Say It's,

2946
02:46:16.641 --> 02:46:17.740
it's pretty cool.
It's,
um,

2947
02:46:17.770 --> 02:46:20.180
and then if you don't know much about [inaudible] and you want to find out about

2948
02:46:20.181 --> 02:46:23.270
the culture,
it's a,
this is the perfect documentary.
Did they realize it?

2949
02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:25.790
We're not bad.
Guys are not thugs.
We're just,
I'm just,

2950
02:46:25.810 --> 02:46:29.320
every day guy is trying to make it in a sport where it involves punching other

2951
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:31.110
people in the face.
Well,
your,

2952
02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:34.310
your people that are involved in a very unusual quest,

2953
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:39.290
the quest to get excellent at using your limbs to fuck up.

2954
02:46:39.291 --> 02:46:44.090
Other dudes were really good at using their limbs and fuck up.
I mean,
it's,

2955
02:46:44.091 --> 02:46:48.740
it's about as exciting a sport and as exciting and endeavor as you could

2956
02:46:48.741 --> 02:46:51.470
participate in it.
You know,
it's beautiful man.

2957
02:46:51.470 --> 02:46:54.950
And it was an honor to have you on here honored and train with you.
You know,

2958

in Moitai and kickbox.

2960
02:47:03.441 --> 02:47:06.170
So it was cool to meet you and I met you at the UFC and it was cool to do this,

2961
02:47:06.171 --> 02:47:08.080
man.
I really,
really appreciate it.
Hey,

2962
02:47:08.250 --> 02:47:11.010

um,

2963
02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:15.350
from the UFC every single weekend and then did to talk to you on Twitter.

2964
02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:18.980
I think a little bit of we come out when you're talking to me that the first one

2965
02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:22.140
there is so cool.
And then to have a relationship,

2966
02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:27.290
we have a relationship and I've traveled for all the way from Australia to

2968
02:47:28.161 --> 02:47:31.260
To actually sit in front of across EMEA and to be in this room is,
um,

2969
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:35.390
so surreal and so amazing.
Let's do it again,

Let's set it up and try to set up some seminars too.

2973
02:47:41.091 --> 02:47:43.970
Maybe we can connect with some people that would like to do more seminars out

2974
02:47:43.971 --> 02:47:47.690
