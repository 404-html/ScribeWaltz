1
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I get that quick,</v>

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 2>quick fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 2>It's so amazing how fast it came back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

7
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Like the addiction of playing that game</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

8
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 2>That it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 2>we've been going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie has been fucking me up to.</v>

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 2>So today I got lucky that he had to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get his shit together.</v>

11
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>He really killed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been fucking me up.</v>

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really play quake,</v>

13
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just from playing a fortnight and</v>

14
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tested myself a little bit because I</v>

15
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 2>knew that this was gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

16
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 2>so I had to get some practice with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>rockets that at some point and yeah,</v>

17
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It honestly helps to warm up with quake</v>

18
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>to play for at night or play pub g or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that because the quick</v>

19
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is of aiming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it that much.</v>

20
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 2>So like when you're doing it three</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

21
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you've already done it 55 times playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>quake just in one round.</v>

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>So like your little interaction you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone a shotgun.</v>

23
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Usually when so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fast paced.</v>

24
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're playing quake for.</v>

25
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

26
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't played that game and maybe 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

27
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 2>See Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're ever going to do it again?</v>

28
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I noticed is my eyesight's</v>

29
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 2>sucks now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My eyesight is not nearly as good.</v>

30
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From 42 to 46,</v>

31
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 2>there was a big dropoff in at 46.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking floor fell out.</v>

32
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like my eyesight's Shit Gamer</v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses.</v>

33
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It takes me a minute when I play games</v>
<v Speaker 2>to one game isn't enough yet.</v>

34
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 2>It probably takes 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe less,</v>

35
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 2>but like to just start tracking things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting your eyes up to speed.</v>

36
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 2>The distance you are away from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

37
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a little bit of time to get in</v>

38
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.124
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

40
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 2>we're right now we're just playing it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local area network.</v>

41
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start going online and playing</v>

42
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when it gets super,</v>

43
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 2>super addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that still play that game must be</v>

44
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

45
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be anywhere near</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths if they're playing that</v>

46
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're really good at it.</v>

47
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 2>like who else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like young kids aren't buying that game.</v>

49
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day you even had a Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>a level that somebody created.</v>

50
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Remember that somebody created a level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

51
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Was that what game with three or four?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was for.</v>

52
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Was it really for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was 11 though,</v>

53
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 2>didn't it come out in 2011?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was three days.</v>

54
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Might have been three wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't rock arena arena for.</v>

55
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>

56
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

57
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I know there was rocket arena for quake</v>
<v Speaker 2>two and there was rocket arena for quake</v>

58
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>three because I started with rocket</v>
<v Speaker 2>arena for quick two,</v>

59
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 2>which have you played today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would think the graphics are</v>

60
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 2>hilariously bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

61
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a good game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little slower.</v>

62
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>The fast game was like quake one was</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast,</v>

63
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 2>too quick too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is slower and then quake three became</v>

64
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 2>more like quake one combination of quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>one quick to do.</v>

65
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quick us.</v>

66
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miss it.</v>

67
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 2>And you tried to play the new quake but</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't,</v>

68
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 2>you didn't like it as much as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is it's fun.</v>

69
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 2>We had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is you have to do</v>

70
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>through their servers.</v>

71
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.410
<v Speaker 3>So it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a load and it's like,</v>

72
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm inpatient,</v>

73
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 3>right motherfucking child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

74
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

75
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you refused to try any of the other</v>

76
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.634
<v Speaker 3>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

77
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Like they're all just new addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

78
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 3>waiting to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like if I got one addiction,</v>

79
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this weekend on Saturday,</v>

80
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.630
<v Speaker 4>they had a concert in fortnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.340
<v Speaker 4>marshmallow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

82
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

83
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.390
<v Speaker 4>I think it's tough to explain what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>

84
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.020
<v Speaker 4>It's called an event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're calling it.</v>

85
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 4>A second event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at 2:00 everybody showed up at the</v>

86
00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:40.701
<v Speaker 4>game in this fucking concert started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all the avatars were together,</v>

87
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 4>like in one gigantic were normal mode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

88
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 4>you played at just like normal and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden like two minutes to go.</v>

89
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.250
<v Speaker 4>They took everybody's guns away and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you all just sort of congregated around</v>

90
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:53.700
<v Speaker 4>the stage and the music started to show</v>
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>

91
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.640
<v Speaker 4>They started doing interactive things</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all the avatars and everything and</v>

92
00:03:56.641 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 4>like 10 minutes later just it cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it turns out it was actually live.</v>

93
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:02.940
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was tweeting about it all day because</v>

94
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.950
<v Speaker 4>for promotion and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people were asking like,</v>

95
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 4>how'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you work it out?</v>

96
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 4>His voice was going live to everyone and</v>
<v Speaker 4>was playing.</v>

97
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Speaker 4>It was probably millions of people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just normal dj voice stuff like,</v>

98
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 4>hey jump guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

99
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just like,</v>

100
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:18.240
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

101
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Like he wasn't interacting too much as</v>
<v Speaker 4>much as he probably does during a normal</v>

102
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 4>set when he's playing to 20,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Vegas or whatever.</v>

103
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

104
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 3>So when he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably has like a really good</v>

105
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 3>microphone to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the microphone that you</v>

106
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Speaker 3>talk shit on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

107
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 3>They had something else set up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we first started doing quick known</v>

109
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 3>you had a type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

110
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>that's how goofy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You to.</v>

111
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now people are talking like they're</v>

112
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 3>all in a group together talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

113
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I have a voice changer now too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't have talking shit.</v>

114
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you hear people talking,</v>

115
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 3>it gets in the way of hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like sound cues.</v>

116
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

117
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Tell your teammates shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can turn that off also.</v>

118
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.873
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

119
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 4>I like to hear the footsteps going</v>
<v Speaker 4>around coming around the corner and</v>

120
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

121
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 3>It's makes it scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.520
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what's scary about quake is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

123
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 3>you hear someone running grow and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know the right around the corner,</v>

124
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 3>you can control all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all up to you.</v>

125
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Volume settings and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

126
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 3>very addictive game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we should talk about this,</v>

127
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jack podcast because everybody got</v>

128
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 3>so upset about it and let's clear up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few things.</v>

129
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy seems to be willing to talk</v>

130
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 3>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I didn't want to talk to</v>

131
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 3>about those things is just he was being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

132
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say he's evasive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was basically just saying what he</v>

133
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:34.381
<v Speaker 3>knew based on the company policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what else more to ask him</v>

134
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 3>and people felt like I didn't press him</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard enough and he to his credit,</v>

135
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 3>reached out to me and said that he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>offer to do another one to ask more</v>

136
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

137
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that would be awesome.</v>

138
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

139
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that people seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about.</v>

140
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to be upset about very</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific cases where people showed.</v>

141
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people were right wing and they were</v>

142
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 3>posting things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were banned.</v>

143
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Whereas people who are left wing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe people of different races or</v>

144
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:11.381
<v Speaker 3>allowed to post racist things or more</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive things and even docs people</v>

145
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>and didn't suffer any consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

146
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 3>This is the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem is I don't spend enough time</v>

147
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 3>reading this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

148
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like when people get</v>
<v Speaker 3>banned.</v>

149
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Like Anthony Kumi is a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know why he got banned.</v>

150
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was that incident with that,</v>

151
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 3>that woman that punched him and he ended</v>
<v Speaker 3>up getting fired.</v>

152
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 3>He was drunk and he said a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>really stupid shit on twitter and then</v>

153
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 3>later apologized for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if that's what got him</v>

154
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>

155
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Kicked off twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's my friend.</v>

156
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying is all these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that have problems,</v>

157
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

158
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

159
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what got Alex Jones</v>

160
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 3>kicked off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I asked him because that</v>

161
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 3>was one of the last platforms for Alex</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones was twitter,</v>

162
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 3>but something got him kicked off their</v>
<v Speaker 3>take on it was it.</v>

163
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 3>They never kicked him off before because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't violate their terms of</v>

164
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another thing that's very</v>

165
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 3>encouraging that Jack said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know it's,</v>

166
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to get mad at things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to get mad at him.</v>

167
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to get mad at me for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

168
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably do the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand it,</v>

169
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.840
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he believes that the ability to</v>

170
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 3>communicate on the Internet through</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter or through these platforms is a</v>

171
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 3>basic human right.</v>

172
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 3>That's how he looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

173
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 3>do you think of it like a network like</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBC,</v>

174
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Speaker 3>like if you're on NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can decide what's on and what's not</v>

175
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you look at it like a utility?</v>

176
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And he specifically said that he looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>at it more like that,</v>

177
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 3>that he thought it was a basic right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very encouraging.</v>

178
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 3>He also said that he would bring on</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is in his team that's</v>

179
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:57.761
<v Speaker 3>responsible for these things so we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear from the actual person who decides</v>

180
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 3>who's getting banned and why they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting banned and what is.</v>

181
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the decision making behind all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

182
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:09.521
<v Speaker 3>So we can go over all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think the podcast would create</v>

183
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 3>such a controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's probably poor prior planning</v>

184
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 3>on my part because my thought about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

185
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a fucking crazy to be running</v>

186
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

187
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Like it's crazy that this thing exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president uses it as a platform.</v>

188
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about the dude who</v>
<v Speaker 3>created this and what does this like to</v>

189
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 3>have this thing evolve to become what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become because it didn't start out</v>

190
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started out like fun shit like at</v>

191
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Brian red bands going to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

192
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what people used it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then along the way became this</v>

193
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 3>global method of distributing</v>
<v Speaker 3>information where people use it in war</v>

194
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>zones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

195
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 3>they use it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell people where attacks are the</v>

196
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 3>user for all kinds of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

197
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a really powerful but strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>medium.</v>

198
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about getting into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeds with all the very specific people</v>

199
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 3>that got banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to find out why they</v>

200
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 3>banned people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my take on it.</v>

201
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot of conservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>voices that have never been banned.</v>

202
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Steven crowder has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>banned.</v>

203
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Cernovich has been banned</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he'd been banned.</v>

204
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch that have not been</v>
<v Speaker 3>banned.</v>

205
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like they banned all right</v>

206
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 3>wing voices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is it?</v>

207
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's what he said.</v>

208
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 3>People reporting the tweet and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody looking at it going,</v>

209
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 3>well this does violate our policy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you know,</v>

210
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 3>all these people that that got banned</v>
<v Speaker 3>violated the policy somehow.</v>

211
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably as simple and clean as</v>

212
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:39.290
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

213
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that simple,</v>

214
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they make their own policies and</v>

215
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 3>it's also not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people are allowed to say similar</v>

216
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:52.011
<v Speaker 3>things that are very racist in vast</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalizations about white people,</v>

217
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 3>which seems to have been the case and at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least a few instances where people</v>

218
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 3>reported that people said fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about white people,</v>

219
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but there was no repercussions.</v>

220
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the argument becomes.</v>

221
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 3>These people are more oppressed and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white people were thought of as the</v>

222
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 3>oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have this white privilege thing</v>

223
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:23.140
<v Speaker 3>that people love to use now as a reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>to to decide to like silence someone</v>

224
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 3>like check your white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>

225
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>

226
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's this genuine movement where</v>

227
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 3>people think that it's okay to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about one race,</v>

228
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 3>whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's racism and if you're allowing</v>

229
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 3>that from any one side and not allowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it from another side,</v>

230
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 3>it seems hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

231
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 3>it's very distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of racism against black people</v>

232
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 3>in this country is very distasteful to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

233
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody who's not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

234
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 3>Because of the history of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of slavery,</v>

235
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 3>because of all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different connotation,</v>

236
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but if you just allow people to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible things about any race,</v>

237
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.250
<v Speaker 3>it's racism.</v>

238
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 3>You are allowing a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a predetermined attitude about a</v>

239
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have done this,</v>

240
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>they have made generalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalizations,</v>

241
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:22.110
<v Speaker 3>a racist statements about white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The really weird thing that people are</v>

242
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 3>thrown around these days is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be racist against white people</v>

243
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>because racism is about power and</v>
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>

244
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 3>It's about using your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in that black people are not</v>

245
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 3>powerful to white people or power from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white people were the ones who are</v>

246
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's impossible to be racist against</v>

247
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like horse shit to me.</v>

248
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm not buying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

249
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not beneficial to anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalize.</v>

250
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 3>This is what we got to get it in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

251
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you're black or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're white or if you're whatever the</v>

252
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not beneficial to generalize,</v>

253
00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.871
<v Speaker 3>to take a person out of the group that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think of as just human individuals</v>

254
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 3>that you have to be an individual.</v>

255
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I acknowledged the fact that people look</v>

256
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.290
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have different heritages as the</v>

257
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.313
<v Speaker 3>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iss,</v>

258
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 3>they have different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different ancestry,</v>

259
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>the different occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's different parts of the world.</v>

260
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 3>There's all these differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>

261
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.550
<v Speaker 3>the only way we're all going to get true</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality and true kinship and comradery</v>

262
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 3>as human beings is that if we recognize</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just all a human being,</v>

263
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are very big differences in the</v>

264
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 3>way we look and the things we like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool,</v>

265
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say shitty things about white</v>

266
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:43.591
<v Speaker 3>people or white men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that leaves everybody who doesn't fit</v>

267
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:48.751
<v Speaker 3>that description guilty in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>way or presumed guilty because of a</v>

268
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 3>racist statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

269
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it that it's different than racism</v>

270
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Speaker 3>against black people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a country that was built essentially in</v>

271
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ways by slavery.</v>

272
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a war for slavery in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and that it is a crazy reality</v>

273
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 3>that it's not your responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not mine.</v>

274
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't do it,</v>

275
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

276
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 3>as a person who's aware of his history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of this country,</v>

277
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 3>racism against white people seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

278
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.860
<v Speaker 3>but it still sucks to be racist against</v>
<v Speaker 3>a racist against black people.</v>

279
00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems different,</v>

280
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 3>but it still sucks to be racist against</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>

281
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Sucks to be racist against Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ricans.</v>

282
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for anybody.</v>

283
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 3>It's that's what we have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this social media thing.</v>

284
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 3>What actually did happen and what is</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>

285
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:43.540
<v Speaker 3>why is it happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's just some social justice</v>

286
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 3>warrior ethic that you're not debating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem fair.</v>

287
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there should be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about this and I bet</v>

288
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 3>they're super reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really intelligent people and it's</v>

289
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 3>possible they can come to a good place</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can all agree to.</v>

290
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 3>That is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a cynical person.</v>

291
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of folks who just want</v>

292
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 3>those that just want the guests what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they already have it.</v>

293
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Speaker 3>They have more money than they could</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever spend and my dealings with Jack as</v>

294
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 3>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems like a very nice guy and a very</v>

295
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:19.081
<v Speaker 3>smart guy and and a very empathetic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think he's in a crazy</v>

296
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 3>unmanageable situation to be running</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like twitter.</v>

297
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's probably people that did</v>

298
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 3>something that they should have done in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of silencing people moving things</v>

299
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably happened.</v>

300
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing when people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>influence over people and there have</v>

301
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 3>been videos had been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're executives from a bunch of</v>

302
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 3>different social media corporations have</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about how to silence certain</v>

303
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:48.040
<v Speaker 3>voices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to push down certain voices.</v>

304
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that needs to be</v>

305
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 3>discussed.</v>

306
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Like is this a policy as a whole?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

307
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it because you think you're pushing</v>

308
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 3>the right message as soon as someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks they're pushing the right message</v>

309
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no debate about that,</v>

310
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just decide our way's the right way</v>

311
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 3>and they're pushing this and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical opposition to that message from</v>

312
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 3>half the country like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but usually like,</v>

313
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:16.401
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

314
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the one that's in control.</v>

315
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 3>That narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the one that's in control of</v>

316
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this far left leaning ideology and</v>

317
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 3>the other part gets pushed aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very bad situation for all of</v>

318
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 3>us because there has to be conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be debate because if</v>

319
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.690
<v Speaker 3>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just shores up the differences</v>

320
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 3>between two people and they fucking hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other even more.</v>

321
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I did not take that into account and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

322
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 3>That's my mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is my mistake when I made that</v>

323
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't take it easy on them</v>

324
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 3>because I didn't want to discuss those</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

325
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't think enough of it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>advance.</v>

326
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as involved in it as other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>

327
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware that there censorship and</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>

328
00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:03.281
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ideas going into that conversation</v>

329
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 3>were more about how insane this method</v>
<v Speaker 3>is for distributing information for the</v>

330
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 3>people that have been banned and for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were fans of the people that</v>

331
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 3>are banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand whether it be upset at</v>

332
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has nothing to do with any</v>

333
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 3>preconceived notions that I had is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the conversation took place,</v>

334
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>so all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you felt let down by that,</v>

335
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you didn't feel like it was an extensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

336
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm more than willing to do it and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>further into it and we're going to and</v>

337
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Jack offered it and he's going to bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else who's gonna explain things</v>

338
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:36.464
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>

339
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I think this will be very beneficial for</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

340
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I also think that there should be a road</v>
<v Speaker 3>to redemption.</v>

341
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I think if you've got something that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>important as twitter or facebook or</v>

342
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not stealing someone stuff</v>

343
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 3>using copyrighted music or something on</v>
<v Speaker 3>an instagram page where you get banned</v>

345
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Speaker 3>over and over again for doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you keep doing it.</v>

346
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>If it's not something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

347
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

348
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 3>an ideological difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you maybe you crossed a line that</v>

349
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:07.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided was align,</v>

350
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to work your way</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

351
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 3>You the should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be a way where you can sign</v>

352
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:14.330
<v Speaker 3>up again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

353
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 3>like get a new email address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that I be the same person.</v>

354
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to be the same</v>

355
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be a way where there should</v>

356
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 3>be different levels.</v>

357
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Definitely everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People fuck up,</v>

358
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck up.</v>

359
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And they make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

360
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 3>And people also grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this guy that was on Sam</v>

361
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Harris' podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Christian ecoline I think is his</v>

362
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking white supremacist,</v>

363
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 3>a full on white supremacist and now he</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the exact opposite.</v>

364
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:47.921
<v Speaker 3>He's like this very progressive guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives speeches on the dangers of racism</v>

365
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 3>and that and the idle ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it caught up with him now if he got</v>

366
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 3>banned when he was a young man and</v>
<v Speaker 3>making terrible decisions and then</v>

367
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 3>became a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't we give it a guy like that?</v>

368
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:03.940
<v Speaker 3>A chance to get back in a platform?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

369
00:18:03.941 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 3>And without making a whole new screen</v>
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>

370
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 3>like maybe it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

371
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 3>with the anonymous model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some things that are really good</v>

372
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.324
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

373
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Like people like Jack even talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

374
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.370
<v Speaker 3>that people can report news stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not worry about fear of retribution that</v>

375
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can whistle blow and not worry</v>

376
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.450
<v Speaker 3>about fear of retribution if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is on the line,</v>

377
00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 3>but they're trying to provide a service</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the general public or they're trying</v>

378
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 3>to give people information that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>might even save lives but could put them</v>

379
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 3>at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in like third world countries</v>

380
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 3>or war torn countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be a huge problem if you have</v>

381
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 3>to post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Brian Red Band,</v>

382
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way you can get this</v>
<v Speaker 3>information out.</v>

383
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 3>You have to use your whole name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it probably be better off for</v>

384
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:56.511
<v Speaker 3>everybody if people had a way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with each other like it's</v>

385
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:04.551
<v Speaker 3>just person to person and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>real problem is when people try to</v>

386
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 3>engineer these conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another conversation about</v>

387
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:10.284
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>

388
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>People have said that we're deleting</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments on Youtube.</v>

389
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 3>We're not deleting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't deleted any comments.</v>

390
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't read them.</v>

391
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure people say mean things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a good time.</v>

392
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 3>The thumbs up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thumbs down thing.</v>

393
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we we,</v>

394
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to have that on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have comments on their</v>

395
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 3>youtube gives you the option to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments on and to have the thumbs up,</v>

396
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 3>thumbs down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking those off.</v>

397
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 3>He could have a good time with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not fucking with that.</v>

398
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 3>There's something that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

399
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I post at 3:41 and Jamie posts it 3:42</v>

400
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 3>and this is the line of the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that.</v>

401
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 3>They've got their own way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is why does youtube do it?</v>

402
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.720
<v Speaker 3>What's their what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they trying to do is are they</v>

403
00:19:57.721 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 3>trying to block out spam?</v>

404
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Are they trying to block out hate speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>or are they trying to engineer</v>

405
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:04.280
<v Speaker 3>conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about comment,</v>

406
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 3>order comments on note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments disappear.</v>

407
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 3>They go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times it's automatic.</v>

408
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 3>If somebody flags a comment that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the comment away until it's like</v>

409
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.510
<v Speaker 3>looked over upon only one person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

410
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think on youtube that that happens</v>

411
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.630
<v Speaker 3>quite often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably be as little as one or two</v>

412
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:22.464
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

413
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Speaker 3>so that is probably what's happening to</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you folks that think your comments</v>

414
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:28.410
<v Speaker 3>are getting deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's deleting shit.</v>

415
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.243
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

416
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not attached to what I do in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that I'm unwilling to look at what</v>

417
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I do wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to look at everything that I do</v>

418
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:41.730
<v Speaker 3>wrong in concluding this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you were upset of this podcast</v>

419
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 3>because you thought somehow another I</v>
<v Speaker 3>sold out because I didn't ask him</v>

420
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:46.224
<v Speaker 3>anymore questions.</v>

421
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I just asked the questions I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask.</v>

422
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I understand you have more costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more questions,</v>

423
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 3>and I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have more questions too,</v>

424
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.010
<v Speaker 3>especially upon seeing people's reaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it and upon making myself pay more</v>

425
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 3>attention to all these various stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt sent us a list of them.</v>

426
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are really fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some crazy things people have</v>

427
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 3>said and not gotten in trouble for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas other people said things that</v>

428
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 3>really weren't that bad and got in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble for it.</v>

429
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question to ask,</v>

430
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>so we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll concentrate on that.</v>

431
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to work out a date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my humblest apologies to all of you.</v>

432
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Don't not trying to let anybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always try to do my best.</v>

433
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.530
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

434
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 3>and also here's another clear one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one tells me what to do.</v>

435
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 3>There's no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no secret person behind the</v>

436
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 3>scenes.</v>

437
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 3>If I fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of me.</v>

438
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It's my fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've prepared more.</v>

439
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 3>I should have thought about it more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't realize like how upset</v>

440
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.770
<v Speaker 3>people would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he did a great.</v>

441
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a great interview and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even think of that.</v>

442
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I thought you kind of touched on it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little when you were talking about Alex</v>

443
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Jones and I think that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

444
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens.</v>

445
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very specific group of people</v>

446
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:57.350
<v Speaker 3>that are upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right wing guys is,</v>

447
00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of American flags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of pepe the frog.</v>

448
00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.870
<v Speaker 3>It's all right.</v>

450
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:10.510

<v Speaker 3>Especially being a troll online.</v>

451

<v Speaker 3>if you're working in some fucking job</v>

00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 3>time I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a little bit of chaos.</v>

459
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 3>I like the fact that there's people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

460
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 3>they're like that fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was upset that that radio,</v>

461
00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 3>that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took it down where they were</v>

462
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 3>fucking with Shiela bu with those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>from four Chan and the way they took it</v>

463
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 3>down was they contacted radio lab and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said those guys are white supremacists</v>

464
00:22:42.251 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 3>and they support white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

465
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 3>and then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 3>you made these people that are awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible people that write terrible</v>

467
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

468
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gave them props.</v>

469
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about something like four</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chan is no,</v>

470
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you might read some terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to realize you're also</v>

471
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 3>reading terrible things from anonymous</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are working at their jobs</v>

472
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 3>most of the time and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck with people's heads and the trying</v>

473
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 3>to get people upset.</v>

474
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're having a good time fucking with</v>

475
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>people if you want to take them as that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like them,</v>

476
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 3>like giving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving a talk to a dear friend or them</v>

477
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 3>giving you an affidavit in court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

478
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 3>you're missing the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entertainment like half of the</v>

479
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 3>whole reason why they're doing it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment.</v>

480
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.360
<v Speaker 3>They didn't go steal shiela booze flag</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go and go right into the camera and</v>

481
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 3>go fuck Shiela.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bu By using coordinates from photographs</v>

482
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 3>of the sky where they figured out where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking with the constellations lie</v>

483
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 3>and then drove around honking their horn</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they could locate where it was</v>

484
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.360
<v Speaker 3>by using the Webcam and listening to how</v>
<v Speaker 3>close they got to it.</v>

485
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fucking genius shit and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>got taken down just by this accusation</v>

486
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 3>of them being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about a forum like four</v>

487
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Chan or Reddit or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have so many fucking people.</v>

488
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 3>You have 3000 and thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people.</v>

489
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 3>If you have 10 clients posting jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>about black people,</v>

490
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 3>that's all you need to ruin the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reputation of thousands of people.</v>

491
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 3>So for someone to say that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

492
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 3>fuck Shiela,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bu is some racist and the white</v>

493
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 3>supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a cheap way out.</v>

494
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a cheap way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

495
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 3>More likely it's some duties board and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's sitting in front of his fucking</v>

496
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:27.410
<v Speaker 3>computer and he works all day and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is where he escapes.</v>

497
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 3>He escapes and types in writes things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then check some later and then it goes</v>

498
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 3>back to and type thing and checks and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps him sane and the stupid fucking</v>

499
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 3>cubicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of the people.</v>

500
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.430
<v Speaker 3>So they pulled that whole amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast down because of that.</v>

501
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Look what He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Shiloh booth thing was ridiculous.</v>

502
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 3>He will not divide us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

503
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.330
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

504
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get a chance at everywhere.</v>

505
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 3>It's funny what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mocked something that's their way</v>

506
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>of mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody got hurt.</v>

507
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They made it out like it was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful crime.</v>

508
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 3>They committed on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This amazing person who's just trying to</v>

509
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:05.300
<v Speaker 3>change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

510
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.060
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They prank Ceaila Boo.</v>

511
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck Shiela bu this is that as of the</v>

512
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.190
<v Speaker 3>above,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

513
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Shiela buff special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy too.</v>

514
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.420
<v Speaker 3>He probably did something silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little silly.</v>

515
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.750
<v Speaker 3>He will not divide us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they.</v>

516
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 3>What they did was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny reaction.</v>

517
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>

518
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I like that this is an important part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing.</v>

519
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no podcast.</v>

520
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Now the like to dislike ratio that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see on youtube videos is fascinating,</v>

521
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's weaponized and they're</v>

522
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 3>thinking about trying to ban that now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because so many people use it to fuck</v>

523
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:49.490
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this about you folks,</v>

524
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 3>but every time we have a chicken here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get fucking torture.</v>

525
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.950
<v Speaker 3>The like to dislike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

526
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Like it's ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except Rhonda.</v>

527
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Patrick said</v>

528
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like it's weaponized.</v>

529
00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to dislike it</v>

530
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's fun because it's fun</v>

531
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.140
<v Speaker 2>because it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also fun to throw a rock at a</v>

532
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:05.974
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

533
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.410
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

534
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of them probably didn't even watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcasts like thumbs down gives them</v>

535
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 2>a disliking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives a little bit of power and the</v>

536
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:17.740
<v Speaker 2>algorithm ofd ranking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affected something and people who</v>

537
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a probably a lot of them that</v>

538
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 2>didn't even watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a button you can press.</v>

539
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 2>People are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:25.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's clearly it shows by the amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dislike.</v>

541
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 2>The people moved on it and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset about it.</v>

542
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's basically it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

543
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting questions that to ask him.</v>

544
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I always thought shadow banning was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real thing,</v>

545
00:26:37.391 --> 00:26:40.030
<v Speaker 2>but I think he came out and said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a real thing.</v>

546
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in my,</v>

547
00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>in person where I'll type</v>

548
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 4>somebody's name in and usually it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>splits to come up on the searches,</v>

549
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't in our</v>

550
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 3>planning is if it is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's another one,</v>

551
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 3>like shadow banning for what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it,</v>

552
00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:01.461
<v Speaker 3>if it's not something that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not doing something that you</v>

553
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 3>could get kicked off the platform for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

554
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not kicking them off,</v>

555
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 3>you just pushing them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird place.</v>

556
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 3>But if you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why are you doing that?</v>

557
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:09.324
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

558
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.230
<v Speaker 4>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what would be the justification from</v>

559
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:14.990
<v Speaker 4>the ones that I have seen three used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>even be a website that you could type in</v>

560
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.940
<v Speaker 4>somebody's user name to see if there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>shadow bands,</v>

561
00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:21.080
<v Speaker 4>so that's kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of porn stars or shadow banned</v>

562
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.720
<v Speaker 4>because they don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're looking up Christina</v>

563
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.553
<v Speaker 4>applegate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want Christina,</v>

564
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple bottom or something like that.</v>

565
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

566
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.000
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

567
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still believe that's a thing,</v>

568
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.890
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure he came out and said</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't a real thing.</v>

569
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Technically shadow banning Justin Bieber</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the trending topics.</v>

570
00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have publicly said that</v>

571
00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:41.780
<v Speaker 4>that's not a shadow ban.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a strategy.</v>

572
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

573
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of forced into it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin Bieber was so.</v>

574
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 3>His fans trend so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hashtag the shit out of that thing</v>

575
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 3>and they just took over the trending.</v>

576
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.040
<v Speaker 4>That's probably happening for other</v>
<v Speaker 4>equally popular celebrities too,</v>

577
00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:56.530
<v Speaker 4>like Taylor swift's and beyond time.</v>

578
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

579
00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably right.</v>

580
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 3>You're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever they're doing at youtube</v>

581
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 3>with comments and whatever they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with twitter,</v>

582
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 3>here's the real conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

583
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 3>The real conversation is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we want that?</v>

584
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Do we want them to cure rate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we want them to decide whose youtube</v>

585
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:22.440
<v Speaker 3>videos you can subscribe to and who do</v>
<v Speaker 3>they unsubscribe people?</v>

586
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Is that real or is that a glitch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

587
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

588
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they unsubscribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either,</v>

589
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:28.990
<v Speaker 3>but people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

590
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 3>let's listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're willing to move justin bieber</v>

591
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 3>from the number one trending because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd number one trends too hard and they</v>

592
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 3>think it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to just acknowledge that our</v>

593
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain humans in our culture,</v>

594
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 3>we're spending an exorbitant amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time thinking about that.</v>

595
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

596
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do we want to lie and pretend</v>

597
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 3>that it's not as big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they just.</v>

598
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they did that just.</v>

599
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 3>If they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

600
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we through the looking glass?</v>

601
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Now you can change the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

602
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 3>What do you lend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When do you decide who gets pushed here?</v>

603
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Who gets pushed there</v>

604
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.020
<v Speaker 4>side?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely the trending page on youtube</v>

605
00:29:09.021 --> 00:29:12.380
<v Speaker 4>is 100 percent controlled by a human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they've said that,</v>

606
00:29:12.381 --> 00:29:17.210
<v Speaker 4>but there are videos that should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>there that aren't based off of the data.</v>

607
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:21.110
<v Speaker 4>You see Youtube has got some weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>things going on with it.</v>

608
00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The video is that they go,</v>

609
00:29:23.451 --> 00:29:26.800
<v Speaker 4>you might like type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did it.</v>

610
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.280
<v Speaker 4>You might like to me a couple months ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it was just videos of a guy towing</v>

611
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 4>cars in dallas like out of their parking</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot and he made these funny cute little</v>

612
00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:39.560
<v Speaker 4>videos with a little commentary using</v>
<v Speaker 4>videos from the security cameras.</v>

613
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I it,</v>

614
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:42.630
<v Speaker 4>but I started watching it and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

615
00:29:42.631 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is interesting.</v>

616
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 4>So I tweeted it out like random video I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got addicted to on Youtube.</v>

617
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was like hundreds of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are like,</v>

618
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 4>I just started watching that.</v>

619
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Youtube recommended that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how did that happen?</v>

620
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little guy with a tow truck company</v>

621
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 4>has now pushed on everybody's laps and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he just went over 100,000</v>

622
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:05.190
<v Speaker 4>subscribers the other day and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like months ago that he was just had</v>

623
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.600
<v Speaker 4>like 10 that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

624
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.880
<v Speaker 4>That's the argument some people have</v>
<v Speaker 4>made that that's how fast the Paul</v>

625
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 4>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they grew and they grew so fast on</v>

626
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 4>youtube that some people thought there</v>
<v Speaker 4>was something up that game like millions</v>

627
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 4>of followers within a week or two of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being on there and then they were coming</v>

628
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:18.840
<v Speaker 4>from another platform.</v>

629
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also coming from another</v>
<v Speaker 2>platform is giant,</v>

630
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:26.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's also all it really takes is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person deciding that whatever the fuck</v>

631
00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you did was funny or weird or crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that cashew outside girl.</v>

632
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's that girls are managed by</v>

633
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:37.460
<v Speaker 4>the same people that own tmz and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>why you see it on tmz every.</v>

634
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 4>I was going to bring up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to fire the fire festival</v>

635
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:40.950
<v Speaker 4>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

636
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.600
<v Speaker 4>an explanation of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How this,</v>

637
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spread of the Fuck Jerry guys,</v>

638
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 4>the marketing team spread that with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>orange picture.</v>

639
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 4>It was a coordinated event over hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 4>of different social media accounts for</v>

640
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:53.720
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the cash me outside girl.</v>

641
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.880
<v Speaker 4>For the FYRE festival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

642
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Firefox to catch everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there are a team of people.</v>

643
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 4>There are agencies that have all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence or accounts.</v>

644
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Speaker 4>They paid them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to accept the money or</v>

645
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 4>accept the offer except the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but oftentimes they do.</v>

646
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a talent agency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

647
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

648
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to share a new person,</v>

649
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.704
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>launch the next,</v>

650
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 4>the next voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

651
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a new song.</v>

652
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:19.070
<v Speaker 4>There's a new movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a new way to suppress stuff.</v>

653
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty cool watching how many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are unsubscribing to fuck Jerry</v>

654
00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 4>and the fat Jew though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

655
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.670
<v Speaker 2>But are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the other day was the day of</v>

656
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.940
<v Speaker 2>like $14 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000 dollars a week.</v>

657
00:31:31.941 --> 00:31:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Weekend real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a significant amount of time.</v>

658
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I was 14 point seven then it was 14</v>
<v Speaker 2>point one.</v>

659
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Haven't looked today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's coming from I think of video.</v>

660
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Someone to shared this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think vic Berger made a video that got</v>

661
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.110
<v Speaker 2>spread around and they took his video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

662
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what he said.</v>

663
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw it on burgers page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a few comics I've posted videos</v>

664
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.034
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

665
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat Jews stole this,</v>

666
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:57.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to reach out and they never</v>

667
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:58.920
<v Speaker 2>got back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got 10 million.</v>

668
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about this idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

669
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Like that's kind of piracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

670
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And so instagram's allowing twitter's</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing piracy.</v>

671
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Well I think they're allowing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to post videos because you don't</v>

672
00:32:13.621 --> 00:32:15.030
<v Speaker 2>really know where it came from.</v>

673
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.950
<v Speaker 2>There's no proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

674
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Like if you find a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many times he posted a Meme,</v>

675
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I pee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I repost whoever sent it to me.</v>

676
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 2>If someone sends it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I'll just find it in a</v>

677
00:32:24.751 --> 00:32:28.290
<v Speaker 2>google search and you've got to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out who made that meme and if I find</v>

678
00:32:28.291 --> 00:32:30.720
<v Speaker 2>their instagram account that I'll try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find it and repost it,</v>

679
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.810
<v Speaker 2>but some people don't and I haven't in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>

680
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I did that one with a baked Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 2>got mad at me because there was one with</v>

681
00:32:37.981 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones sitting in hot tub</v>

682
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 3>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when your friends are trying</v>

683
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 3>to chill and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to keep dropping truth</v>

684
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:46.070
<v Speaker 3>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious.</v>

685
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was his right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just posted it because someone said to</v>

686
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone sent it to me in a text message,</v>

687
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those things have a creator.</v>

688
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know Pete,</v>

689
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 3>like Eddie Bravo makes his own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He makes them sometimes,</v>

690
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 3>but he'll send some to me or post some</v>
<v Speaker 3>online that he finds that are funny too.</v>

691
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And everybody tries to credit the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did it right.</v>

692
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 3>But now what they do is they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take it and they credit the person,</v>

693
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't</v>

694
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.380
<v Speaker 4>for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only attempt.</v>

695
00:33:16.381 --> 00:33:18.030
<v Speaker 4>They're accrediting fake accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they'll make,</v>

696
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.840
<v Speaker 4>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're not getting busted in the</v>

697
00:33:21.841 --> 00:33:22.621
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just explaining.</v>

698
00:33:22.621 --> 00:33:23.460
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

699
00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:25.980
<v Speaker 4>what is that about though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that seems like deception.</v>

700
00:33:25.981 --> 00:33:29.850
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way around the back door</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that that qualification of it needs</v>

701
00:33:29.851 --> 00:33:31.380
<v Speaker 4>to be on an account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to point to somebody,</v>

702
00:33:31.381 --> 00:33:32.970
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we'll point to this account,</v>

703
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's not even a real account and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they find like they'll post stuff and</v>

704
00:33:37.261 --> 00:33:41.880
<v Speaker 4>then later add the person because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>person contacts them and they're almost</v>

705
00:33:41.881 --> 00:33:46.881
<v Speaker 4>like that's admitting to piracy like we</v>
<v Speaker 4>did hire because if they just reposting</v>

706
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.140
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of folks including me do that.</v>

707
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're making the person making</v>

708
00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:51.600
<v Speaker 4>money or not.</v>

709
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's important.</v>

710
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't make any money off my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

711
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:00.330
<v Speaker 3>They're making millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been offered to post stuff up and</v>

712
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something was fucking killer and they</v>

713
00:34:04.141 --> 00:34:06.180
<v Speaker 3>wanted to give me money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm greedy.</v>

714
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll take some money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't lie about it.</v>

715
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.530
<v Speaker 3>I haven't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never accepted any money yet.</v>

716
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's also,</v>

717
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:19.901
<v Speaker 4>I think in instagram's a law that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put that it's an ad if you're</v>

718
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 4>making money off of it and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>another thing that both fuck Jerry and</v>

719
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:27.660
<v Speaker 4>fat Jew or not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not putting the cad is.</v>

720
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted like to devil's advocate</v>
<v Speaker 4>this though is is there a place for them</v>

721
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:34.960
<v Speaker 4>for those accounts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is there a place to be the re</v>

722
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 4>tweeter have the means to be that guy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be that account,</v>

723
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like isn't that valuable source?</v>

724
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.200
<v Speaker 4>It is a curator position.</v>

725
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of valuable.</v>

726
00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:46.530
<v Speaker 3>But the question is like if it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is valuable and it becomes</v>

727
00:34:46.531 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 3>something almost like redistributing</v>
<v Speaker 3>your standup.</v>

728
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing a set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if standup sets where you know</v>

729
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.830
<v Speaker 3>something that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get everywhere and you could</v>

730
00:34:55.831 --> 00:34:59.430
<v Speaker 3>just repost it on your page but then</v>
<v Speaker 3>your page becomes super popular because</v>

731
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.850
<v Speaker 3>you are all these people stand up sets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know like spotify,</v>

732
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.430
<v Speaker 3>spotify gets ads right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't really.</v>

733
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.370
<v Speaker 3>They pay the artists a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly they make all the money.</v>

734
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know like if it's,</v>

735
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.150
<v Speaker 4>you use like say sorry later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just do it and say I'm sorry,</v>

736
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:16.090
<v Speaker 4>we'll figure it out after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you figure it out.</v>

737
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Business oriented things that have art</v>
<v Speaker 4>in them as opposed to art</v>

738
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.160
<v Speaker 3>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that start making money.</v>

739
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.460
<v Speaker 3>There are two very different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is not an art thing.</v>

740
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.430
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find other people's art and they</v>

741
00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.080
<v Speaker 3>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pushing it,</v>

742
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.260
<v Speaker 3>they create these accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The accounts get giant.</v>

743
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 3>People pass it around because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just finding funny things and then they</v>

744
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 3>start profiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the people that created all the</v>

745
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 3>intellectual property gets zero money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird.</v>

746
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I only learned more about this when</v>

747
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 3>exit through the gift shop came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did?</v>

748
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know and I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe he did.</v>

749
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about it is that this is</v>

750
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 3>happening right now on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a totally different animal.</v>

751
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking</v>

752
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.360
<v Speaker 3>exact photo duplicates and putting them</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his website for sale like these.</v>

753
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 3>This is when someone's doing on an</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram page is like you could within</v>

754
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 3>seconds take a piece and put it</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>

755
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 3>It's seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian posts something.</v>

756
00:36:18.841 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ha,</v>

757
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 3>I go to copy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the fucking repost at a APP,</v>

758
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll repost it.</v>

759
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 3>It's seconds later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do that all day and if you</v>

760
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 3>hire kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he has people working</v>

761
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if these guys do,</v>

762
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 3>they hire people for fucking 20 bucks an</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour or whatever and these people just</v>

763
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Speaker 3>do it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just find funny shit all day long.</v>

764
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 3>They look for certain hashtags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meme factories or what they're calling.</v>

765
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

766
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some people like,</v>

767
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have made some funny ones all their</v>

768
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:52.830
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that are just doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

770
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I know Dalea has done a bunch of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also one that they do</v>

771
00:36:56.191 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 3>where they steal people's act and make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>meme out of it and then posted it on</v>

772
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:01.674
<v Speaker 3>their page.</v>

773
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.650
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets even more slippery</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're talking about like</v>

774
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:08.140
<v Speaker 3>standups acts that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making money off it.</v>

775
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 3>How much are they making off each post?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

776
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these are multimillion dollar</v>

777
00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 3>business and the punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you have this 10 minute joke that</v>

778
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.760
<v Speaker 3>everyone has the punchline because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw it on facebook.</v>

779
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoiler alert one for sure if you're</v>

780
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 3>still doing that material because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't on Netflix or a comedy central</v>

781
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:25.830
<v Speaker 3>special or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

782
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.730
<v Speaker 3>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's always happened though,</v>

783
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.330
<v Speaker 3>hasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV shows have been accused of stealing a</v>

784
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 3>stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened on.</v>

785
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Do they did it to Kevin James?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it happen.</v>

786
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Kevin James was at the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a development deal for NBC back</v>

787
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a back when we were young pups.</v>

788
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Both of us were like 27 or some shit.</v>

789
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's a little older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was actually,</v>

790
00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 3>that was like during the news radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

791
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 3>so we're probably like in our thirties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had this development deal,</v>

792
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.980
<v Speaker 3>nice development deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're paying them a lot,</v>

793
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 3>a lot of gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of paper and they were setting up</v>

794
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 3>a sitcom around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had him do a set at a theater in</v>

795
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he does this set and has all these</v>

796
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:15.750
<v Speaker 3>writers from various sitcoms and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>very next season,</v>

797
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:21.050
<v Speaker 3>one of his best jokes is on an episode</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a television show that's very</v>

798
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:24.300
<v Speaker 3>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very popular.</v>

799
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

800
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

801
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.930
<v Speaker 3>they fucking stole his bitmap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's where I was going because</v>

802
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 3>that was in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like we're now 25,</v>

803
00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years later.</v>

804
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 3>The popular medium</v>

805
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.490
<v Speaker 2>is instagram and social media different</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>

806
00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different because there's</v>

807
00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:44.660
<v Speaker 3>accountability now because now people</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that if you wrote a meme and you</v>

808
00:38:44.661 --> 00:38:49.220
<v Speaker 3>put it up on your site and then fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>jerry comes along and steals your shit</v>

809
00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:51.560
<v Speaker 3>and doesn't credit you for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just puts it up there.</v>

810
00:38:51.561 --> 00:38:55.400
<v Speaker 3>You know what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless someone sent it to them and</v>

811
00:38:55.401 --> 00:38:57.800
<v Speaker 3>didn't attribute it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is possible,</v>

812
00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.660
<v Speaker 3>but it seems much more likely that what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

813
00:39:02.661 --> 00:39:04.460
<v Speaker 3>they were doing on purpose for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time.</v>

814
00:39:04.461 --> 00:39:06.620
<v Speaker 3>And they just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought that's what you could do on</v>

815
00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:08.000
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wild west.</v>

816
00:39:08.001 --> 00:39:11.870
<v Speaker 3>You could just take memes and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>become famous and looked at fat Jewish</v>

817
00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:12.530
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

818
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy became famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What whether you agree with his methods</v>

819
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.410
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It worked.</v>

820
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.920
<v Speaker 3>He got his crazy hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shows you,</v>

821
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:23.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's just crazy looking guy and he</v>

822
00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:27.680
<v Speaker 3>has all these funny memes that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else wrote and they're all up on his</v>

823
00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:30.950
<v Speaker 3>instagram page and it worked and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like him.</v>

824
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a lot of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like him.</v>

825
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.550
<v Speaker 3>People will get real shitty with them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

826
00:39:34.551 --> 00:39:36.710
<v Speaker 3>They don't want them to do an appearance</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they know what he did.</v>

827
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's a certain number of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that go,</v>

828
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:40.820
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a thief.</v>

829
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Like this is not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what you did is not cool.</v>

830
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.790
<v Speaker 3>But then there's certain people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care and then there's certain</v>

831
00:39:46.791 --> 00:39:47.690
<v Speaker 3>people that think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

832
00:39:47.691 --> 00:39:50.810
<v Speaker 3>what he did was just what anybody did</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>

833
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It was the wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one thought about it and once he</v>

834
00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:56.210
<v Speaker 3>established that business model and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was effective,</v>

835
00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:00.260
<v Speaker 3>it was probably very hard for him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow it down or to attribute things to</v>

836
00:40:00.261 --> 00:40:02.750
<v Speaker 3>people or to admit that he didn't do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all.</v>

837
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.980
<v Speaker 3>That amount of time</v>

838
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:09.900
<v Speaker 2>just bugs me that companies pay these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys knowing that they do this or like</v>

839
00:40:09.901 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 2>as a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

840
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.800
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's signed with caa who's signed with a</v>

841
00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>bunch of comedians they probably took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.970
<v Speaker 2>they're taken from the same basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

843
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.320
<v Speaker 2>it is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

844
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if he was going on stage and doing</v>

845
00:40:22.771 --> 00:40:24.570
<v Speaker 2>their acts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been doing appearances.</v>

846
00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a book.</v>

847
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.740
<v Speaker 2>He's been on TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

848
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's doing.</v>

849
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.830
<v Speaker 2>He's doing by maybe showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

850
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously used it for profit.</v>

851
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.540
<v Speaker 2>He's figured out a way to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

852
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.120
<v Speaker 2>He must be weirded out by this fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerry thing too,</v>

853
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.490
<v Speaker 2>because you might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must be sitting there going,</v>

854
00:40:41.491 --> 00:40:42.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

855
00:40:42.421 --> 00:40:45.030
<v Speaker 2>here was going to leave me alone.</v>

856
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.953
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

857
00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy central was advertising on the</v>

858
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 3>fuck Jerry page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like Jesus folks.</v>

859
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

860
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 3>It was like Jesus folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I just sit you guys down?</v>

861
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Go over a little history.</v>

862
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.993
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy.</v>

863
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might've been car.</v>

864
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.690
<v Speaker 2>They didn't learn that either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

865
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Well that was while it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did learn eventually they let it go</v>

867
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was also because the ratings</v>

868
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:14.280
<v Speaker 2>have dropped through the floor or</v>

869
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedies on fucking easy to make up,</v>

870
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like meme kind of comedy</v>

871
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.230
<v Speaker 3>that's done by folks that are working in</v>
<v Speaker 3>offices,</v>

872
00:41:25.231 --> 00:41:28.080
<v Speaker 3>meme kind of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the funniest fucking comedy on</v>

873
00:41:28.081 --> 00:41:30.240
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's done by regular people.</v>

874
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sound like most</v>

875
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>memes are written by high level</v>
<v Speaker 2>satirists that worked for the New</v>

876
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:39.711
<v Speaker 2>Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

877
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking regular folks who think</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's funny.</v>

878
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's going to happen is that</v>

879
00:41:45.341 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 2>as technology improves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like being able to scan a photo and</v>

880
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we could tell the first time this</v>

881
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:53.660
<v Speaker 2>was ever put on the Internet with from</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little girl,</v>

882
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>she took a photo of it has all the data</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the picture and that's now used on</v>

883
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:00.180
<v Speaker 2>this mean that's making this much money</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this game.</v>

884
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Then it's gonna be kind of broken down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

885
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of artists.</v>

886
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

887
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea for the buyer and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for the block chain getting</v>

888
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 2>involved in here because we could tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

889
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it can be in the data and the</v>

890
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>bins like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

891
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

892
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 2>What if someone uses a picture of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>

893
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 2>so you have a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use a picture of your band and then</v>

894
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 2>they have a funny meme under the picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your band who owns that?</v>

895
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Then that's what like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think beyonce tried to get that</v>

896
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 2>picture taken off the Internet from her</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the super bowl a couple years ago</v>

897
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>because it was like a bad picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't like how she looked in it.</v>

898
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.830
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

899
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 2>That's how the fuck is that lady to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad picture.</v>

900
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't talk to her.</v>

901
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Go listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

902
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not your best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you look fucking great.</v>

903
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Like if that shit was on tinder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be on like did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

905
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>If someone was paying for that meme</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be onstage gets some of the money</v>

906
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:55.140
<v Speaker 2>or that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question you would have with</v>

907
00:42:55.141 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 2>like a corporation.</v>

908
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which should someone be able to grab</v>

909
00:42:58.221 --> 00:42:59.930
<v Speaker 2>photos that are out in the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>

910
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 2>make something with it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>profiting.</v>

911
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

912
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.870
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that that's why I said bands</v>

913
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 2>because they're like really good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting copyright and their logo and</v>

914
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had like the kiss band logo,</v>

915
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't think gene Simmons would come</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you.</v>

916
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>He's coming at you with some lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>

917
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.410
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just what he's going to do,</v>

918
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's who owns those photos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's like Gene Simmons,</v>

919
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 2>like spitting fire out and I think if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took the photo and the cameras were</v>

920
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:30.701
<v Speaker 2>allowed inside the event you took it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not for what the cases though.</v>

921
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Most of the photographs or people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are putting out there,</v>

922
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:35.870
<v Speaker 2>just putting them up online and someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes it.</v>

923
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like say if you gene simmons</v>
<v Speaker 2>spitting fire and then it has a joke</v>

924
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 2>about eating hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy or something like whatever it is.</v>

925
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Like make something funny there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's online and that becomes this</v>

926
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:53.080
<v Speaker 2>giant meme that gets all these likes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow or another someone,</v>

927
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you profit from you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>From instagram?</v>

928
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't profit from individual posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those individual posts will boost</v>

929
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:01.470
<v Speaker 2>your signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

930
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Some posts are profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram,</v>

931
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you have to say add on it to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsored post,</v>

932
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:08.864
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 2>What legally exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd probably say 90 percent of them</v>

934
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.053
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

935
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's like instagram is you</v>

936
00:44:17.151 --> 00:44:20.620
<v Speaker 2>can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram models talking about t I e s</v>

937
00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:21.454
<v Speaker 2>t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>

938
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole instagram model is a</v>

939
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:27.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking hilarious position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

940
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Powerful position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

941
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

942
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how many of them there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they make money.</v>

943
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's smart.</v>

944
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how butts are such a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing now.</v>

945
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like when I was a kid that no one</v>

946
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:42.390
<v Speaker 2>cared about butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was big.</v>

947
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 2>But you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

948
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

949
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this before</v>

950
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.890
<v Speaker 2>when I said let's start mixed a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the game and everybody's like,</v>

951
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 2>oh you like big butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

952
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even an issue back then.</v>

953
00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Girls would have giant fake boobs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny flat butts and they were perfect.</v>

954
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother would have millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram model hits.</v>

955
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Fat bottom girls was before that</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly,</v>

956
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 2>but no one really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make the rock world go round.</v>

957
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a great God damn song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see Bohemian rhapsody.</v>

958
00:45:16.081 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it?</v>

959
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I heard it wasn't that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you guys talking</v>

960
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it was amazing.</v>

961
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

962
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant queen fan though.</v>

963
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my number one cryogenic song when</v>

964
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the crowd chambers dragging</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack to do</v>

965
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.660
<v Speaker 2>because you got to move around when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in that 240 degrees below zero.</v>

966
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.460
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still do a little dancing in there.</v>

967
00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did a rainy Malik,</v>

968
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I think is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actor's name that played him Freddy</v>

969
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

970
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 2>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before it happened,</v>

971
00:45:48.301 --> 00:45:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Sacha Baron Cohen was sort of in talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

972
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 2>but you wanted to take the character in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different direction that no one was</v>

973
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:57.450
<v Speaker 2>really comfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've rather have seen that.</v>

974
00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.920
<v Speaker 2>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

975
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:02.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

976
00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't because it's been said to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>get spicy talk,</v>

977
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 2>but you can't just add stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife</v>

978
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 2>an art piece like Bohemian rhapsody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it is an art piece,</v>

979
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a documentary of a guy's life.</v>

980
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Like in some ways you're documenting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

981
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Like it's supposed to be his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make up things that never</v>

982
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:28.010
<v Speaker 2>really happened or I forget what movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a,</v>

983
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>it's the difference between like a bio</v>
<v Speaker 2>pic and an actual biography or</v>

984
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the difference you're</v>

985
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 2>making a Hollywood movie versus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is the difference in terms of</v>

986
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:39.370
<v Speaker 2>the story creative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think creative control.</v>

987
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I like being creative with some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we know this event happened in this</v>

988
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened that day before and in the</v>

989
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen where one one is</v>

990
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>knowing all the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foxcatcher versus a documentary</v>

991
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 2>about Mark Schultz parts in there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you specifically know.</v>

992
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked with for no resistance</v>

993
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just the parts that I know,</v>

994
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't even talk to mark about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

995
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 2>but there was a bunch of parts that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think he was furious about where it made</v>

996
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 2>it look like they were doing blow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe doing some gay stuff.</v>

997
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

998
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

999
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of weird scenes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things were implied or just seemed odd.</v>

1000
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know this happened in less</v>

1001
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:17.680
<v Speaker 2>mark told you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1002
00:47:17.681 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 2>and mark was furious at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1003
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.230
<v Speaker 2>after it was released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>

1004
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I like the big one was that they changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>his opponent when he fought in the UFC.</v>

1005
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a Russian guy when he in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact fought big daddy</v>

1006
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 3>goodrich who's a legend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big daddy goodrich's an MMA legend.</v>

1007
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:38.180
<v Speaker 3>He was a pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in the early UFC,</v>

1008
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 3>the giant yoked black dude with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geeky.</v>

1009
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean he would fight with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has one of the most brutal knockouts</v>

1010
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 3>in the history of the sport where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought this wrestle.</v>

1011
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Paul Herrera and Paul took him down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got into a position where a big</v>

1012
00:47:55.271 --> 00:48:00.271
<v Speaker 3>daddy goodrich was lying on him sideways</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he elbowed him in the face like 10</v>

1013
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 3>times in the course of like three</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

1014
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's so horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watching his head just bounce off</v>

1015
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.620
<v Speaker 3>before they stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking brutal.</v>

1016
00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the most brutal Kales you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever see in your life.</v>

1017
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.980
<v Speaker 3>So this guy wasn't a just a regular guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you just substitute them out and</v>

1018
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.170
<v Speaker 3>make the guys named Tom Instead of Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1019
00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 3>it was big daddy goodrich.</v>

1020
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 3>That's who mark Schultz fought when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought in the UFC.</v>

1021
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>

1022
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.651
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1023
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1024
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:31.421

<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1025
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:36.421
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy is cop out and his arms</v>

1026
00:48:37.361 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 3>are trapped in his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A trap.</v>

1027
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:43.741
<v Speaker 3>Big Daddy's got him in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a like a crucifix position and it's from</v>

1028
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Paul tried to take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was a.</v>

1029
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 3>So that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big daddy goodrich is a.</v>

1030
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 3>he's a famous fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they took some nobody and</v>

1031
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.930
<v Speaker 3>removed him from the movie and changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the name of someone where it was.</v>

1032
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.560
<v Speaker 3>It didn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a historical event in mma.</v>

1033
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason anything.</v>

1034
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.060
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some crazy producer.</v>

1035
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I think you should fight the Russian guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is.</v>

1036
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.460
<v Speaker 2>We're in the cold war again baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1037
00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:15.210
<v Speaker 2>You boot and I don't know how you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>about politics and some producer.</v>

1038
00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Just one of the judges on the soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some writer just wanted to cup his own</v>

1039
00:49:18.991 --> 00:49:21.510
<v Speaker 2>balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squirt one off into the fucking stew.</v>

1040
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1041
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.640
<v Speaker 2>the screenplay to make it to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1042
00:49:26.641 --> 00:49:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only other thing that makes sense is</v>

1043
00:49:28.111 --> 00:49:30.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe they would've had to pay get daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodrich.</v>

1044
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't want to pay him.</v>

1045
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that makes sense.</v>

1046
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.270
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Mike Tyson,</v>

1047
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had that video game a long time ago</v>

1048
00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:44.190
<v Speaker 2>with Nintendo and they had to pay him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use Mike Tyson's punch in,</v>

1049
00:49:44.191 --> 00:49:47.370
<v Speaker 2>punch out and then after like a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years he was like,</v>

1050
00:49:47.371 --> 00:49:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't done like this in.</v>

1051
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.340
<v Speaker 2>So now it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just called punch out.</v>

1052
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even Mike Tyson in the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore day.</v>

1053
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Like take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some new dude.</v>

1054
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you done the Vr boxing game yet?</v>

1055
00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done the Vr boxing game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks cool.</v>

1056
00:50:00.511 --> 00:50:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Like the rocky one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is,</v>

1057
00:50:02.361 --> 00:50:04.170
<v Speaker 2>is a whole bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A whole bunch of them too.</v>

1058
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.520
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like a regular boxing game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You playing on TV is so stupid.</v>

1060
00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in comparison to a vr game,</v>

1061
00:50:12.601 --> 00:50:14.100
<v Speaker 2>in a Vr game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're boxing,</v>

1062
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see your hands in front of you,</v>

1063
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.510
<v Speaker 2>the guy's throwing jabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're slipping,</v>

1064
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.630
<v Speaker 2>you're like standing in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can catch punches with your hands,</v>

1065
00:50:21.631 --> 00:50:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you can throw shots to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1066
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.850
<v Speaker 2>You get tired doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could really get a workout</v>

1067
00:50:26.851 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1068
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And this is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>

1069
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Speaker 2>what you had sent us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new rocky when they just updated</v>

1070
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 2>clubber Lang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr. T's in it or is it just random guy</v>

1071
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 2>with Mohawk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1072
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.430
<v Speaker 2>that's clubber Lang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

1073
00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 2>look how everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if people were really that Jack</v>

1074
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is.</v>

1075
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 2>So what does that Drago and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

1076
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:50.530
<v Speaker 2>There's drago versus rocky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 2>But we can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see what it looks like from</v>

1078
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 2>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>

1079
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a regular video game or that is</v>

1080
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 2>just for testing of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is just a teaser that showed.</v>

1081
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was looking for the updated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see what it looks like when</v>

1082
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you've got those gloves in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you tried Vr pull yet?</v>

1083
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1084
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like regular pool.</v>

1085
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Vr are so great.</v>

1086
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need to get it out of my living</v>

1087
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much for my living.</v>

1088
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>There's things that you couldn't do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vr pool that you need to understand.</v>

1089
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>If you're actually playing pool with</v>
<v Speaker 2>real pool,</v>

1090
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 2>you need friction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1091
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 2>This looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because it looks nice.</v>

1092
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:33.720
<v Speaker 2>It looks a little bit of haptic feedback</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this to get maybe the next step to</v>

1093
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>look how he's using his hands to block</v>
<v Speaker 2>too crazy.</v>

1094
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.050
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1095
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>when when someone swinging on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this fake person in front of his</v>

1096
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nerve wracking.</v>

1097
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You think you're going to get hit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do get hit and you see red</v>

1098
00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.220
<v Speaker 2>where you see white rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just killed them.</v>

1099
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's funny watching the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty amazing how vr really gets</v>

1100
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.850
<v Speaker 2>immersive like where you were like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>resident evil video game.</v>

1101
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's scary as fuck.</v>

1102
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:02.390
<v Speaker 2>You really think zombies are coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you.</v>

1103
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:02.991
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1104
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 2>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that game.</v>

1105
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:06.960
<v Speaker 2>The thing about that game though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily.</v>

1106
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Boxing thing does not necessarily reward</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect technique.</v>

1107
00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just you could kind of just do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do that.</v>

1108
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to like be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to use it as a workout,</v>

1109
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to actually be disciplined</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use good technique.</v>

1110
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Well you'd probably do is put gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put some velcro gloves on and put the,</v>

1111
00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little fucking hand thing glove</v>

1112
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.350
<v Speaker 2>close to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're better than the next year.</v>

1113
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just duck tape it year or two.</v>

1114
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:33.270
<v Speaker 2>It'll be in the glove itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1115
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.660
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called the knuckle</v>

1116
00:52:35.661 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 2>controller is the next version of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vive controller.</v>

1117
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It fits around your hand like a glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just goes around your neck if</v>

1118
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to grab sort of in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

1119
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Cause um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have your hands this way,</v>

1121
00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:53.300
<v Speaker 2>like with thumbs up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thumbs up shows the gloves like this on</v>

1122
00:52:53.301 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 2>the screen for some strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're throwing punches,</v>

1123
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.840
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to change that,</v>

1124
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

1125
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 2>it's like they want you to just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's freaking me out.</v>

1126
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.150
<v Speaker 2>But when you're actually doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1127
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 2>if it looked like your hands in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>position as your hands,</v>

1128
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 2>it would be a worthwhile way to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like Freddy Roach could</v>

1129
00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 2>literally do a game where he showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1130
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the gap right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

1131
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:22.070
<v Speaker 2>right pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then here comes the hook,</v>

1132
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 2>duck under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll go to the body,</v>

1133
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 2>go to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could do that and do drills</v>

1134
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.250
<v Speaker 3>with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually you could pick up real</v>

1135
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 3>skills in a vr game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with boxing,</v>

1136
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.780
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly kickboxing,</v>

1137
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little less because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving your legs,</v>

1138
00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 3>you're not just moving your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you'd have to have some sort of</v>

1139
00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 3>sensors on your legs so I can know what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing to make sure you're not</v>

1140
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.190
<v Speaker 3>showing bad technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your knee might be down or you</v>

1141
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 3>might be doing something funky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have boxing,</v>

1142
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 3>those two things are just like gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you need to learn as all the other</v>

1143
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.750
<v Speaker 3>things you need to learn how to punch it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and move around,</v>

1144
00:53:57.751 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 3>but you can effectively with just</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding onto those things,</v>

1145
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're staying in the same position that</v>

1146
00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you would be if you were really boxing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can move around the ring too.</v>

1147
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an area like the size of this desk</v>

1148
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe like a little bit more so it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're in one place and you don't</v>

1149
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:15.300
<v Speaker 3>have footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could actually develop footwork too,</v>

1150
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 3>so they can have like a facility Loma</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chanko doing like footwell drills,</v>

1151
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 3>footwork drills rather where you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn on a virtual reality thing,</v>

1152
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 3>where to step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fucking bad ass.</v>

1153
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff that you could learn some</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit from those things.</v>

1154
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:34.300
<v Speaker 4>I like how the Vr is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an amusement park or a buildings</v>

1155
00:54:34.611 --> 00:54:35.990
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like chuck e cheese where it's</v>

1156
00:54:35.991 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 4>just vr rides now we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1157
00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you're a parachuting or you're on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rollercoaster and stuff.</v>

1158
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.180
<v Speaker 4>I like how they're doing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of malls have that</v>

1159
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:45.011
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done those.</v>

1161
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I've done the little spaceship ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you roll a Dune buggy around on the</v>

1162
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.823
<v Speaker 3>surface of that.</v>

1163
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Have you done the star wars one in Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet?</v>

1164
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:57.030
<v Speaker 4>I guess you actually have like five</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in your group that you can see in</v>

1165
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.200
<v Speaker 4>the game and there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1166
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.080
<v Speaker 4>Have you played at the Glendale</v>
<v Speaker 4>Galleria?</v>

1167
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:02.120
<v Speaker 4>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1168
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Do the dopest one they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the Disney land?</v>

1169
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 3>The same Disneyland village,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Disneyland village one is.</v>

1170
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a start star wars one and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also a wreck it Ralph one.</v>

1171
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 3>The record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph one is fucking amazing.</v>

1172
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Is the same company avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

1173
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same place.</v>

1174
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.880
<v Speaker 3>So they have the star wars one</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

1175
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 3>so they'll have like one game set up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of weeks and then they'll</v>

1176
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 3>have the other game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to Disneyland and that was the</v>

1177
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.460
<v Speaker 3>dopest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't really.</v>

1178
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By far.</v>

1179
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Fucking amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wear the suit.</v>

1180
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have this vest on,</v>

1181
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 3>so you're feeling when you get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel in your chest,</v>

1182
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 3>you feel heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have moved places where you walk</v>

1183
00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:47.370
<v Speaker 3>through and it's like lava below you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel he was the star wars one.</v>

1184
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 3>When you're getting shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it in your chest.</v>

1185
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pick the gun up off the wall and</v>

1186
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you've got like storm trooper arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see you're holding the gun in front</v>

1187
00:55:55.231 --> 00:55:56.080
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1188
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that was in Glendale do.</v>

1189
00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 3>They're getting so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This still.</v>

1190
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 3>You still are super aware that you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a game for now.</v>

1191
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.131
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1192
00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:10.131
<v Speaker 3>go from Pong to fucking what's the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>red dead redemption.</v>

1193
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the best graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking insane graphics.</v>

1194
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what does that 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years they went to that these virtual</v>

1195
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.550
<v Speaker 3>reality games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years from now are going to be</v>

1196
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's gonna want be in regular life.</v>

1197
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Regular life's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1198
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 2>There's not going to be at Disneyland or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney world anymore.</v>

1199
00:56:28.871 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll still be there,</v>

1200
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 2>but you'll be able to get on every ride.</v>

1201
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.170
<v Speaker 4>I haven't watched this myself yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the MBA makes a viewing and vr</v>

1202
00:56:39.171 --> 00:56:42.560
<v Speaker 4>available now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not every game,</v>

1203
00:56:42.561 --> 00:56:45.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's like once a week they have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular game you can.</v>

1204
00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:49.310
<v Speaker 4>You can log in and watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They changed the cameras a little bit.</v>

1205
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:52.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's perfect yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1206
00:56:52.221 --> 00:56:53.670
<v Speaker 4>Very cool though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1207
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Like watching this on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on the floor and they'll.</v>

1208
00:56:57.141 --> 00:56:59.660
<v Speaker 4>But they'll move you around so you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>sear in the footage to it.</v>

1209
00:56:59.661 --> 00:57:01.880
<v Speaker 4>I think they have a separate announcing</v>
<v Speaker 4>team,</v>

1210
00:57:01.881 --> 00:57:03.800
<v Speaker 4>so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're talking about what you're seeing</v>

1211
00:57:03.801 --> 00:57:07.550
<v Speaker 4>versus like listening to the normal TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite not there yet.</v>

1212
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:11.660
<v Speaker 4>We filmed a couple episodes of kill Tony</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Vr and we had some of the top of the</v>

1213
00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:14.900
<v Speaker 4>line cameras for it and still wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>there yet.</v>

1214
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 4>It was more hassle than it was worth.</v>

1215
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:21.170
<v Speaker 2>This seems like something that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing for the UFC though.</v>

1216
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this would be a major basically</v>

1217
00:57:24.051 --> 00:57:26.030
<v Speaker 2>have your view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.380
<v Speaker 2>except you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cage.</v>

1219
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.480
<v Speaker 2>The cage would be in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's gotta be a way that they</v>

1220
00:57:29.481 --> 00:57:34.481
<v Speaker 2>could film through the cage if they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a camera in a reinforced position</v>

1221
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 2>where it was far enough back behind foam</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no way it could interfere</v>

1222
00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:46.910
<v Speaker 2>if someone crashed into it but yet close</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough that it could see through an</v>

1223
00:57:46.911 --> 00:57:50.960
<v Speaker 2>actual hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could get the entire octagon if you</v>

1224
00:57:50.961 --> 00:57:53.180
<v Speaker 2>did it with several.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several different ones.</v>

1225
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Are those</v>

1226
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 4>they had or they had it at least at</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1227
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:57.131
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1228
00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:59.210
<v Speaker 4>but it was a ground level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they call it the Phantom Cam,</v>

1229
00:57:59.211 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 4>but maybe it had a different name and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was vr.</v>

1230
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't vr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know the UFC is used it a few times.</v>

1231
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:06.430
<v Speaker 4>They always try out things there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very experimental.</v>

1232
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 4>They don't always show everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying out though.</v>

1233
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 4>But problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool to try.</v>

1234
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.700
<v Speaker 4>Maybe one time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ideally you'd want it right in the</v>

1235
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:16.870
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like not above or two below.</v>

1236
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it would have to have because it has</v>

1237
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:20.560
<v Speaker 4>cameras all around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1238
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.840
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1239
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.980
<v Speaker 4>Now that's hard to do with the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess a without getting in the way,</v>

1240
00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:29.814
<v Speaker 4>if everything.</v>

1241
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to.</v>

1242
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to find a good spot for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on a burst buffers head and let</v>

1243
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:39.471
<v Speaker 2>him just go to town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1244
00:58:39.471 --> 00:58:42.710
<v Speaker 2>they used to do that with pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pride used to have like they would wear</v>

1245
00:58:42.711 --> 00:58:46.670
<v Speaker 2>glasses with like cameras next to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses and you'd get the referee</v>

1246
00:58:46.671 --> 00:58:47.630
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool separating fighters and</v>

1248
00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:53.660
<v Speaker 2>breaking it up and waving the fight off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1249
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1250
00:58:54.961 --> 00:58:56.480
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1251
00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:58.300
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>

1252
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just a little team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marshall camp is what?</v>

1253
00:59:00.831 --> 00:59:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's going Pov Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just point at me,</v>

1254
00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

1255
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one like that that's pointed at</v>

<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1257
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have seen that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:15.290
<v Speaker 2>they use that sometimes when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we go crazy when we jump up fights</v>

1260
00:59:15.291 --> 00:59:18.020
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that was even.</v>

1261
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that's what they did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for until one day I saw online.</v>

1262
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1263
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a smart thing to do because</v>

1264

<v Speaker 3>sometimes we do get animated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been several fights were me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>while the like the end,</v>

1267
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:36.110

<v Speaker 3>knocked out Cris Cyborg,</v>

1268
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were like,</v>

1269
00:59:37.581 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did I just say?</v>

1271
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just can't sit down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're not even trying to control it and</v>

1274
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 3>you just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see somebody do something</v>

1275
00:59:56.991 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 3>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some wild crazy francis in</v>

1276
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Ghana knocking out Alistair overeem type</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>

1277
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:05.114
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So that was the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see the one below it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>at the camera in the upper right.</v>

1284
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I know that froze up video taken by John</v>

<v Speaker 3>a great guy who lives in Australia,</v>

1287
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>was there at the fights in Australia</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey</v>

1288
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:47.110
<v Speaker 3>and he filmed Holly Holm head kicking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronda Rousey and then turns to me and I</v>

1289
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:50.780
<v Speaker 3>turned to him and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck just happened?</v>

1290
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.870

<v Speaker 3>But when you see it,</v>

1292
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 3>like in that moment when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see something that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He tied the fastest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NFL 40.</v>

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Like white people are not protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This includes targeted mis-gendering or</v>

1486
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 3>deadnaming of transgender transgender</v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>

1487
01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love how they just went with the giant</v>

1488
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 3>corporation and they just went with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>new word that's only been around for</v>

1489
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:32.960
<v Speaker 3>like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has deadnaming been around for</v>

1490
01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 2>the urban dictionary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had It in there from 2014.</v>

1491
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 2>He never even heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're on the ball.</v>

1492
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you to stay ahead.</v>

1493
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Twitter still allows goat season and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the porn you want.</v>

1494
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1495
01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>porns consensual.</v>

1496
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.300
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1497
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1498
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I love the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the chaos of it all.</v>

1499
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that</v>

1500
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.750
<v Speaker 3>trying to sort everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's.</v>

1501
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.940
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre that</v>

1502
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:08.050
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that sense with that like that's so</v>

1503
01:10:08.051 --> 01:10:13.051
<v Speaker 3>vague to dehumanize or degrade what</v>
<v Speaker 3>every joke about someone,</v>

1504
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:18.070
<v Speaker 3>every joke about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single joke about trump that every</v>

1505
01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:23.071
<v Speaker 3>single comedian and slash or commentator</v>
<v Speaker 3>in or person makes is in some way</v>

1506
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:25.680
<v Speaker 3>degrading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk about how fucking stupid.</v>

1507
01:10:25.681 --> 01:10:28.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like Rob Reiner had a joke about</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1508
01:10:28.001 --> 01:10:32.530
<v Speaker 3>called him a piece of shit or call them</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of crap yesterday and said he</v>

1509
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 3>couldn't believe how fucking dumb he is.</v>

1510
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Trump talking about hillary though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it to him.</v>

1511
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

1512
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.320
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's so vague.</v>

1513
01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.513
<v Speaker 3>That's so vague</v>

1514
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and dead naming is not a real word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like how are they using fake words in</v>

1515
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:47.564
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1516
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.860
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to say it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a real real word.</v>

1517
01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if your name used to be</v>

1518
01:10:57.481 --> 01:11:00.960
<v Speaker 3>bruce and you change it to Caitlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that.</v>

1519
01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:05.490
<v Speaker 3>That seems bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems bananas.</v>

1520
01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.580
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're fucking with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say somebody became a woman and it's</v>

1521
01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 3>still an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't call him Mike,</v>

1522
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Mike,</v>

1523
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.290
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're bitter about this whole</v>

1524
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 3>changing your sex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't bring that up.</v>

1525
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still an annoying guy.</v>

1526
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have your deck anymore by</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if someone says that they can't say</v>

1527
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:30.630
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't they say that they should.</v>

1528
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.890
<v Speaker 3>That's to me stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1529
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that that's hurtful,</v>

1530
01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:39.501
<v Speaker 3>I guess to transgender people and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be considered hate speech or hate</v>

1531
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:46.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever but own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But only when it comes to like gender,</v>

1532
01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could tell someone,</v>

1533
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're short and fat and stupid and they</v>

1534
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one cares.</v>

1535
01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:55.543
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1536
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:57.310
<v Speaker 3>You could say you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1537
01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.140
<v Speaker 3>you're ugly as fuck your noses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disgusting.</v>

1538
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.820
<v Speaker 3>What happens there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same?</v>

1539
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.780
<v Speaker 3>What is it the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be if you do it repeatedly,</v>

1540
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1541
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.440
<v Speaker 3>once you just throw one out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

1542
01:12:12.441 --> 01:12:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably one time you could shit on</v>

1543
01:12:14.691 --> 01:12:17.230
<v Speaker 3>someone's looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like what?</v>

1544
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Like deciding what you can and shit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone for like what I'm saying is if</v>

1545
01:12:21.441 --> 01:12:24.380
<v Speaker 3>someone's an asshole and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect one.</v>

1546
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:28.760
<v Speaker 3>That woman who used to be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's transgender woman who was in a</v>

1547
01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:32.810
<v Speaker 3>store screaming at this kid behind the</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter that it's ma'am,</v>

1548
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it's man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a perfect example of that guy</v>

1549
01:12:35.511 --> 01:12:38.360
<v Speaker 3>was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking huge and she used to be a</v>

1550
01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:42.800
<v Speaker 3>guy and clearly still looks like a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's saying it's fucking ma'am.</v>

1551
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked some shit over.</v>

1552
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.560
<v Speaker 3>She got violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:53.050
<v Speaker 3>In that situation you're telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not cool to say,</v>

1554
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:56.930
<v Speaker 3>how about you settle the fuck down</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you look like a guy.</v>

1555
01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.020
<v Speaker 3>You're acting like a violent guy and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be a guy.</v>

1556
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Pardon me if I think you're still a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy</v>

1557
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:06.560
<v Speaker 3>that's deadnaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a good thing to say in that</v>

1558
01:13:06.561 --> 01:13:09.380
<v Speaker 3>particular instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So without nuance,</v>

1559
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without context,</v>

1560
01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:14.660
<v Speaker 3>it's saying you can't say anything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrade someone.</v>

1561
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Well clearly that would degrade that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1562
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.650
<v Speaker 3>but if that guy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that kid,</v>

1563
01:13:18.651 --> 01:13:21.140
<v Speaker 3>he did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On twitter you're saying someone can't</v>

1564
01:13:21.141 --> 01:13:22.090
<v Speaker 3>respond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1565
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're really upset that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got your Dick or moved and these still</v>

1566
01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.590
<v Speaker 3>look your guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck you.</v>

1567
01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Like why can't someone say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's people communicating how</v>

1568
01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 3>they feel about you being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you start out being a dick and</v>

1569
01:13:34.371 --> 01:13:37.100
<v Speaker 3>then they communicate about you being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dick by being a dick as well.</v>

1570
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Are we banning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the product is covering their</v>

1571
01:13:39.591 --> 01:13:42.050
<v Speaker 3>butts and there's probably not like of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jamie said,</v>

1572
01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.140
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous to control people's</v>

1573
01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and behavior because who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to say and when does it end?</v>

1574
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.210
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just keeps going and going and going</v>

1575
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:54.080
<v Speaker 3>and going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets.</v>

1576
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.700
<v Speaker 3>It gets very slippery when you have one</v>
<v Speaker 3>group that thinks it's right and they're</v>

1577
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.740
<v Speaker 3>trying to control another group that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks they're right.</v>

1578
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a.</v>

1579
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:06.680
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so simple when you just talk</v>

1580
01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 3>about deadnaming transgender people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not degrading people based on their or</v>

1581
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:15.310
<v Speaker 3>their ethnicity or their this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you're doing is you're trying</v>

1582
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 3>to dictate how humans communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and people don't like it when</v>

1583
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 3>you tell them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with telling people what to</v>

1584
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>do is they want to do the exact opposite</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the first things you realize</v>

1585
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:25.870
<v Speaker 3>when you have kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1586
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got to figure out a way to sneak</v>

1587
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:30.580
<v Speaker 3>information into them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1588
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:34.510
<v Speaker 3>or you gotta you gotta figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not be too bossy.</v>

1589
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>People don't want someone telling them</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do.</v>

1590
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.220
<v Speaker 3>This is what I missed when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>editing,</v>

1591
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.660
<v Speaker 3>headed into that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed how other people looked at that</v>

1592
01:14:43.661 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 3>guy and what he stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's correct.</v>

1593
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's way more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an insane business to run</v>

1594
01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really knew why Alex</v>

1595
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Jones was band or anybody else has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really knew.</v>

1596
01:14:57.251 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I think he's dealing with a giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation and he's a young guy</v>

1597
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.820
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandals titling company here.</v>

1598
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:05.591
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

1599
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:08.560
<v Speaker 3>What kind of Sandoz is a weird ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Nice Guy.</v>

1600
01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's just choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He runs a couple of different companies.</v>

1601
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.460
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not sitting at twitter office.</v>

1602
01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that Alex Jones</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up today that he sponsors the</v>

1603
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 3>podcast through the cash app,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also.</v>

1604
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 3>He also runs 100 percent true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would have,</v>

1605
01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 3>and I think we talked about it on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

1606
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.830
<v Speaker 3>We even talked about the cash app being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sponsor and about how it's helped.</v>

1607
01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Justin wren is fight for the forgotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>charity.</v>

1608
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 3>So Alex Jones erroneously said that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't mention it,</v>

1609
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:40.030
<v Speaker 3>so we did mention it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is</v>

1610
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:45.090
<v Speaker 3>a</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to like respond to people that</v>

1611
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:51.160
<v Speaker 3>want to know if I've seen what Alex</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones has said about me lately is one of</v>

1612
01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:56.161
<v Speaker 3>the weird things that I have dealt with</v>
<v Speaker 3>because first of all I've always had</v>

1613
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.920
<v Speaker 3>good dealings with Alex in person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>person to person,</v>

1614
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:02.110
<v Speaker 3>but he's obviously in a world of shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1615
01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on with him with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sandy hook stuff and he wasn't entirely</v>

1616
01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 3>honest with me about what he had said</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Sandy Hook.</v>

1617
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he didn't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a.</v>

1618
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to phrase it in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than the way I interpreted it when</v>

1619
01:16:17.111 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I saw the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a media matters video that</v>

1620
01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 3>shows all the time where he said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandy Hook was fake.</v>

1621
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.580
<v Speaker 3>This is a very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1622
01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 3>struggled with bringing him back on the</v>

1623
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very complicated.</v>

1624
01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.620
<v Speaker 3>It's that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though</v>

1625
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>around him,</v>

1626
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a friend.</v>

1627
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:45.580
<v Speaker 3>He's awfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He obviously did something fucked up and</v>

1628
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 3>the parents that had to deal with what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1629
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 3>There's parents that had to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people calling them a crisis actor.</v>

1630
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.540
<v Speaker 3>They had to deal with people harassing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them at the courthouse and harassing</v>

1631
01:16:58.631 --> 01:17:02.440
<v Speaker 3>them if they met them in public because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying that they were lying</v>

1632
01:17:02.441 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>about their kids being killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only are their kids being killed,</v>

1633
01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:09.290
<v Speaker 3>but they have to deal with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>harassing them and saying,</v>

1634
01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:14.291
<v Speaker 3>you're a liar and you're enactor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insanity and I wouldn't.</v>

1635
01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I would think about it differently.</v>

1636
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.790
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think about differently if</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't friends with Alex,</v>

1637
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but I would also think about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>differently if he hadn't made shit up</v>

1638
01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:27.500
<v Speaker 3>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that I was told to stop talking</v>

1639
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 3>about conspiracies are they threatened</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family that's 100 percent horseshit</v>

1640
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 3>and he has my phone number he could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>called me.</v>

1641
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I called him after I heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me that someone told him that.</v>

1642
01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:42.290
<v Speaker 3>I told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to the person who told him that</v>

1643
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking bananas.</v>

1644
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you out of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call me.</v>

1645
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>This is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think I'm not talking about</v>

1646
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fill in the blank.</v>

1647
01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous conspiracy,</v>

1648
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:54.600
<v Speaker 3>the rothschilds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Rockefeller's,</v>

1649
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about that because the</v>

1650
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 3>government threatened my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking wrong.</v>

1651
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you've put it out there.</v>

1652
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 3>So Alex Jones went on afterwards and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologized and corrected it.</v>

1653
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Then recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I haven't had him on the</v>

1654
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he decided to start saying that I worked</v>

1655
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.510
<v Speaker 3>for the CIA and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1656
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Soros talking points,</v>

1657
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.310
<v Speaker 3>which I don't even know what these</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking talking points,</v>

1658
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:24.290
<v Speaker 3>our talking points about him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific not talking to anybody.</v>

1659
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 3>No one's giving me talking points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not George Soros,</v>

1660
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo has been saying he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1661
01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.890
<v Speaker 3>He got good information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even say that.</v>

1662
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:37.150
<v Speaker 3>So stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz did fuck with it for awhile</v>

1663
01:18:37.151 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1664
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 3>but the point being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point being Alex is you're out</v>

1665
01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still like you as a person.</v>

1666
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 3>If I saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd still give you a hug,</v>

1667
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 3>but you're making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

1668
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 3>this is not helping anybody wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend you.</v>

1669
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not helping me as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about the good qualities in you and</v>

1670
01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1671
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 3>these things that you're saying are made</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1672
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:04.040
<v Speaker 3>You're making up the fact that I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CIA.</v>

1673
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:08.300
<v Speaker 3>You're making up for the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood insiders have given me</v>

1674
01:19:08.301 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 3>information and tell me what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

1675
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not true.</v>

1676
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 3>You know me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to be a CIA insider.</v>

1677
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't take on another job and between</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing standup and podcasts and UFC</v>

1678
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running a family,</v>

1679
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>

1680
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather stop doing everything than</v>

1681
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 3>work for any government organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever approached me.</v>

1682
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:36.140
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever approached anybody I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever heard of.</v>

1683
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

1684
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:41.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is they always say is that the</v>

1685
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:44.720
<v Speaker 3>CIA would talk to the people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and tell them what to say in</v>

1686
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:48.290
<v Speaker 3>terms of propaganda and maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1687
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any personal knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1688
01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure someone has decided that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to make a movie about like</v>

1689
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 3>zero dark 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have to get some sort of</v>

1690
01:19:57.141 --> 01:20:01.830
<v Speaker 3>approval and I'm sure that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies that are very inspirational that</v>

1691
01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 3>have to do with the military would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>great for recruitment.</v>

1692
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure there's some involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's also some patriots that</v>

1693
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:13.011
<v Speaker 3>work in show business that want to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>out these movies about the government</v>

1694
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 3>and about the military in a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive way.</v>

1695
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the case in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>instances too,</v>

1696
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 3>but not everything's a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy and this is why it's stupid.</v>

1697
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid is some things are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy.</v>

1698
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.570
<v Speaker 3>And Alex Jones has talked about some</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that were real conspiracies,</v>

1699
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 3>that nine slash 11 documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road to tyranny details the world</v>

1700
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:40.251
<v Speaker 3>trade organization protests where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent in these agent provocateur tours</v>

1701
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 3>that which are essentially soldiers.</v>

1702
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 3>They send in soldiers and military</v>
<v Speaker 3>people dressed up in all black and cover</v>

1703
01:20:47.521 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 3>their face and they smashed windows and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tip over things and they take a peaceful</v>

1704
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>protest and they turn it violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the police can move in and shut</v>

1705
01:20:54.781 --> 01:20:57.390
<v Speaker 3>down the protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then not only did they do that,</v>

1706
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 3>but they made a no protest zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the United States of America,</v>

1707
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no protest zone.</v>

1708
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Was it the United States of America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't Vancouver,</v>

1709
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:05.760
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Seattle,</v>

1710
01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I think Seattle coover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1711
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 3>I think at Seattle World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 3>Organization protests template with the</v>

1712
01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:16.491
<v Speaker 3>boots and they all have that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Alex detailed this in detail and it</v>

1713
01:21:18.061 --> 01:21:22.830
<v Speaker 3>was real when he makes things up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was one recently,</v>

1714
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:27.660
<v Speaker 3>the David Pakman show had on about Alex</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about people eating babies</v>

1715
01:21:27.661 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 3>pituitary glands and scattered vandalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>of downtown Seattle.</v>

1716
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:32.214
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seattle.</v>

1717
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 3>So the enforce a no protest zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was in 2009 in 1999 rather.</v>

1718
01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Was It [inaudible] 99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>December first 1999.</v>

1719
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.050
<v Speaker 3>The October 27.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand nine was the article.</v>

1720
01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex did that.</v>

1721
01:21:48.151 --> 01:21:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was legit and it was very</v>

1722
01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:54.040
<v Speaker 3>informative because I didn't know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is how the government operates</v>

1723
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.420
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you contact him the second time and</v>

1724
01:21:56.421 --> 01:21:57.580
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are often.</v>

1725
01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.180
<v Speaker 3>I send them a text message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is why I won't talk to you.</v>

1726
01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:05.181
<v Speaker 3>You say crazy stupid shit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't hate the guy.</v>

1727
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.090
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1728
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:08.220
<v Speaker 3>he'll scream and yell and call me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>demon.</v>

1729
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:11.160
<v Speaker 3>He's not a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not in a good place when you're</v>

1730
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:14.010
<v Speaker 3>defending against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what all these other conspiracies,</v>

1731
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 3>like it's all fun and games until you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about people's kids getting</v>

1732
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:19.560
<v Speaker 3>murdered and then all of a sudden people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

1733
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically what happen with</v>

1734
01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:22.470
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1735
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:27.390
<v Speaker 3>If he was just ranting about government</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies or you know,</v>

1736
01:22:27.391 --> 01:22:30.690
<v Speaker 3>who shot this guy or who's stealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>money from here.</v>

1737
01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Some of what he talks about is</v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>

1738
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:36.780
<v Speaker 3>But Alex is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's in a good place.</v>

1739
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's in a good place</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally.</v>

1740
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>And I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's in a good place in</v>

1741
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 3>terms of his situation with the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hate you.</v>

1742
01:22:43.861 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to this,</v>

1743
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 3>if I saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd still give you a hug.</v>

1744
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll still even do your fucking show</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I come to Austin.</v>

1745
01:22:49.981 --> 01:22:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

1746
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.970
<v Speaker 3>we can come and hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just stop making shit up.</v>

1747
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1748
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1749
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 3>A more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry of what you said about those kids.</v>

1750
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1751
01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:09.310
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all terrible now.</v>

1752
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the road to redemption for</v>

1753
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:16.660
<v Speaker 3>someone like that because some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing about people is,</v>

1754
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is also what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Alex.</v>

1755
01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:23.970
<v Speaker 3>people need a road to redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if if someone fucks up horribly and</v>

1756
01:23:25.841 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 3>does something terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should that be the end of them?</v>

1757
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 3>This idea that we don't need them</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1758
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 3>no matter who it is.</v>

1759
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does a person have to do to grow</v>

1760
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 3>and learn and for people just accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>them again and lead them on to all</v>

1761
01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 3>platforms again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1762
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does a person have to do?</v>

1763
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.700
<v Speaker 3>It's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's</v>

1764
01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.500
<v Speaker 4>per person though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like somebody like Alex just seems like</v>

1765
01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:55.650
<v Speaker 4>he's getting worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this seems like what he did teach</v>

1766
01:23:55.651 --> 01:23:58.470
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mad at me because I haven't had them</v>

1767
01:23:58.471 --> 01:23:59.920
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1768
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:03.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure to you he asked you or if he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in town?</v>

1769
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:04.523
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1770
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you not listening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I didn't want to have them on</v>

1771
01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:08.690
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out whether I</v>

1772
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.910
<v Speaker 3>would have him on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I watched the media matters</v>

1773
01:24:10.911 --> 01:24:13.670
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very clear to me he wasn't being</v>

1774
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.160
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked him if he had said that it was</v>

1775
01:24:16.161 --> 01:24:20.090
<v Speaker 3>fake and he said he questioned whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not it was real,</v>

1776
01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.790
<v Speaker 3>but then eventually he acknowledged that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was real,</v>

1777
01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>which he has done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was many times where he said</v>

1778
01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:27.200
<v Speaker 3>it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not One,</v>

1779
01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.060
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely fake.</v>

1780
01:24:29.061 --> 01:24:31.340
<v Speaker 3>It was 100 percent fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's video of it.</v>

1781
01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the video before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did our nine slash 11 podcast.</v>

1782
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it now and I still thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>about having them on.</v>

1783
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I still thought about talking to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and talking to them about all</v>

1784
01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:43.100
<v Speaker 3>this shit and what it's like.</v>

1785
01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:47.010
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He plays a character.</v>

1786
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1787
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean with the reptiles guys and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the things that he says,</v>

1788
01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:53.130
<v Speaker 4>none of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half of it's just like,</v>

1789
01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:54.390
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1790
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I think he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely goes,</v>

1791
01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.270
<v Speaker 3>goes crazy with some things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he's doing well,</v>

1792
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.860
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about eating babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pituitary glands were found fondant.</v>

1793
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.680
<v Speaker 3>David Pakman video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Pakman,</v>

1794
01:25:06.681 --> 01:25:10.550
<v Speaker 3>who's a progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a commentator online.</v>

1795
01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.680
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going,</v>

1796
01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:14.060
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's wrong with him.</v>

1797
01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Like he's playing this video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what he's talking about them</v>

1798
01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:18.604
<v Speaker 3>breaking into</v>

1799
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.220
<v Speaker 4>what is happening in the Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1800
01:25:20.221 --> 01:25:23.310
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find the part on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>video where Alex is talking.</v>

1801
01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:25.170
<v Speaker 4>It's early on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like schizophrenia.</v>

1802
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:29.640
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like any episode of live pd or</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops and people are talking like,</v>

1803
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I saw aliens upstairs in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1804
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:34.980
<v Speaker 4>like the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Owen Benjamin,</v>

1805
01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:35.671
<v Speaker 4>look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

1806
01:25:35.671 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 4>play this place real quick.</v>

1807
01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:40.370
<v Speaker 6>It's all in plain view of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just putting it in our face.</v>

1808
01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.640
<v Speaker 6>They want a system where we can't do</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything to stop them.</v>

1809
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:48.540
<v Speaker 6>That's like Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the name of his production company as a</v>

1810
01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:49.763
<v Speaker 6>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Love,</v>

1811
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:52.980
<v Speaker 6>which is enabled slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Basically.</v>

1812
01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:57.720
<v Speaker 6>They make jokes about having sex with</v>
<v Speaker 6>kids all the time and she says it's okay</v>

1813
01:25:57.721 --> 01:25:58.720
<v Speaker 6>to have sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1814
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:01.580
<v Speaker 6>kids don't have section 35 year olds</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're 12,</v>

1815
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:06.420
<v Speaker 6>just incredibly evil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pathetic stuff of these solas demons</v>

1816
01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.320
<v Speaker 6>like Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Josh was saying he had a theory,</v>

1817
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.880
<v Speaker 6>the only one walnut saw says USA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the pituitary gland because they</v>

1818
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:24.311
<v Speaker 6>confirm that Jimmy Chevelle and others</v>
<v Speaker 6>would a torsional kids to death,</v>

1819
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 6>but they couldn't get regular ones to</v>
<v Speaker 6>kill.</v>

1820
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 6>Her favorite thing was to grab a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>run over with the car so they could say,</v>

1821

<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>But they would hurry to the morgue and</v>

1823
01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:35.530
<v Speaker 6>they work with different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>different government controlled morgues</v>

1824
01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.940
<v Speaker 6>and eat the pituitary gland as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 6>as possible,</v>

1825
01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1826
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and get high off of it.</v>

1827
01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:41.024
<v Speaker 6>So yes.</v>

1828
01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this.</v>

1829
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:48.690
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher's done a fucking pedophile.</v>

1830
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.150
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1831
01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:56.151
<v Speaker 2>This is like a weird rambling and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not alex that I knew from 1998.</v>

1832
01:26:56.730 --> 01:26:58.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same guy.</v>

1833
01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:04.080
<v Speaker 2>This is a guy who's not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my apology,</v>

1834
01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being to Alex Jones,</v>

1835
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were hurt that I didn't have you</v>

1836
01:27:08.851 --> 01:27:12.390
<v Speaker 2>back on the show if you were hurt that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally poke fun at you.</v>

1837
01:27:12.391 --> 01:27:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hilarious unfortunately.</v>

1838
01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.380
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1839
01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't wish you wish you badly.</v>

1840
01:27:19.771 --> 01:27:22.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day I enjoyed a lot of your</v>

1841
01:27:22.441 --> 01:27:24.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People lose their way,</v>

1842
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1843
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1844
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a real bad feeling being stuck on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside too when they all band</v>

1845
01:27:36.721 --> 01:27:40.260
<v Speaker 2>together and kick you out and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks you out.</v>

1846
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and facebook and everybody and</v>

1847
01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Youtube and twitter was the last one.</v>

1848
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.780
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know</v>

1849
01:27:48.781 --> 01:27:51.960
<v Speaker 2>why Alex Jones got kicked off twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people like,</v>

1850
01:27:51.961 --> 01:27:52.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them back in.</v>

1851
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1852
01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:56.190
<v Speaker 2>but somebody knows somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1853
01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who's looking at each individual</v>

1854
01:28:00.931 --> 01:28:04.110
<v Speaker 2>person that gets banned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have a feeling that that stuff is</v>

1855
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.030
<v Speaker 2>compartmentalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1856
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.440
<v Speaker 2>I told you 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7 million monthly active users.</v>

1857
01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how many people are.</v>

1858
01:28:13.231 --> 01:28:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm responsible for banning people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>real high profile people though.</v>

1859
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe 12 people.</v>

1860
01:28:20.641 --> 01:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>They have to have a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they,</v>

1861
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they talked to Jack,</v>

1862
01:28:23.671 --> 01:28:24.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they,</v>

1863
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.180
<v Speaker 2>they position who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1864
01:28:27.181 --> 01:28:27.721
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1865
01:28:27.721 --> 01:28:29.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1866
01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe he didn't know when people got</v>

1867
01:28:31.921 --> 01:28:34.080
<v Speaker 2>banned until he liked maybe got</v>
<v Speaker 2>accompany memo.</v>

1868
01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he wasn't involved in the course.</v>

1869
01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1870
01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's the one that called them up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1871
01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.120
<v Speaker 2>get rid of this motherfucker that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible too.</v>

1872
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another one,</v>

1873
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one that people had an issue</v>

1874
01:28:45.541 --> 01:28:48.720
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing you could say,</v>

1875
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:50.490
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1876
01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:51.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Kathy Griffin held up the,</v>

1877
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trump head,</v>

1878
01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:55.230
<v Speaker 2>remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1879
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.850
<v Speaker 2>did she do that on her own twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>account?</v>

1880
01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1881
01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.470
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1882
01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.600
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1883
01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.910
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a photo of it.</v>

1884
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>When she posted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she posted on instagram or twitter.</v>

1885
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100 percent sure.</v>

1886
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that it's A.</v>

1887
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>is it allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's allowed because it's newsworthy</v>

1888
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:19.221
<v Speaker 2>because it's a celebrity and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity is threatening a public figure</v>

1889
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 2>who is also the most powerful person in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1890
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:23.723
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1891
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that is.</v>

1892
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I think she posted it because it was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>art piece that was kind of</v>

1893
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>

1894
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1895
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

1896
01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Why are saying why is it okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is she still allowed to be on the</v>

1897
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:38.490
<v Speaker 2>platform?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Alex Jones case kicked off.</v>

1898
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting question,</v>

1899
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:40.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1900
01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:42.690
<v Speaker 2>what do you need to do to get kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>off?</v>

1901
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kathy's done.</v>

1902
01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently she was one of the people that</v>

1903
01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:50.280
<v Speaker 2>was calling for the name for that young</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy who was,</v>

1904
01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:52.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that native American in front of</v>

1905
01:29:52.861 --> 01:29:54.900
<v Speaker 2>his face beating the drum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's crazy,</v>

1906
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.980
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1907
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she feels bad about it now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>retrospect,</v>

1908
01:29:58.231 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 2>especially if she's watched the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got carried away and she</v>

1909
01:30:00.991 --> 01:30:02.220
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we all thought when you saw the</v>

1910
01:30:02.221 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>picture that smirking can't have a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got in the face,</v>

1911
01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:07.170
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful indigenous man is singing</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1912
01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.900
<v Speaker 2>his rain dance cry or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>

1913
01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it was though.</v>

1914
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 2>We found out afterwards it was much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

1915
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.270
<v Speaker 2>What is their song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were they saying?</v>

1916
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Sounded cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should make a record.</v>

1917
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you like that shit?</v>

1918
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 2>That shit's cool to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you work out,</v>

1919
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.620
<v Speaker 2>if you could get like some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some legit native American chance like</v>

1920
01:30:28.621 --> 01:30:30.720
<v Speaker 2>that puts you into a trance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1921
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:33.960
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know what they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just go running and you listen</v>

1922
01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:36.840
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took a little couple tokes.</v>

1923
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Go for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for a jog in the woods,</v>

1924
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.560
<v Speaker 2>listening to native American chance on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your air ponds.</v>

1925
01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting video though</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean I was a one 80 after just</v>

1926
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 2>hearing the second side of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 12 hours later people still were</v>

1927
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:52.350
<v Speaker 2>calling for that guy's head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 2>And people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>seeing what I'm seeing.</v>

1933
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And she said something about some white</v>
<v Speaker 2>prick or white motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you are seeing what you're seeing.</v>

1937
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.240
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1938
01:31:17.290 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing is a video that shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it occurred.</v>

1939
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:23.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1940
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1941
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that okay?</v>

1942
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Why is it okay for some journalists to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say horrible things about white people?</v>

1943
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Why is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that okay?</v>

1944
01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it encourages violence against a</v>

1945
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 2>innocent white person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one should be responsible.</v>

1946
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:44.100
<v Speaker 2>What if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you do that?</v>

1947
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read Blah,</v>

1948
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:46.890
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah as a tweet.</v>

1949
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.851
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1950
01:31:47.851 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I am going to go out and punch a white</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1951
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found some white old lady and I</v>

1952
01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 2>beat her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone decides that you're not</v>

1953
01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 2>responsible for that or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

1954
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>But you kind of feel</v>

1955
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:03.490
<v Speaker 3>like you played a part in the way people</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at things,</v>

1956
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 3>especially people that are very easily</v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced,</v>

1957
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.680
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just also,</v>

1958
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 3>it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He reads something really racist against</v>

1959
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:11.981
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1960
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:14.090
<v Speaker 3>that's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you think all,</v>

1961
01:32:14.091 --> 01:32:16.720
<v Speaker 3>all people are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A whole group of people that don't have</v>

1962
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:18.130
<v Speaker 3>as much melanin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all shit.</v>

1963
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're ridiculous person.</v>

1964
01:32:21.371 --> 01:32:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you're brown or black or</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow,</v>

1965
01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 3>you're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's silly because we have to decide.</v>

1966
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:31.850
<v Speaker 3>It's got to decide like what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing.</v>

1967
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.160
<v Speaker 3>If we keep letting illogical behavior be</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

1968
01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:42.050
<v Speaker 3>like breaking us off into fucking groups</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and thinking that you know,</v>

1969
01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:46.280
<v Speaker 3>all men are great or all women are great</v>
<v Speaker 3>or all gays are great and never all</v>

1970
01:32:46.281 --> 01:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>straight cisgendered men can go fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1971
01:32:48.501 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1972
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:52.880
<v Speaker 3>that's silly talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who you are,</v>

1973
01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:55.520
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we let people do that.</v>

1974
01:32:55.521 --> 01:32:57.320
<v Speaker 3>If they're a part of a marginalized</v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

1975
01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.150
<v Speaker 3>if someone's a part of a marginalized</v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

1976
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:03.080
<v Speaker 3>then you get to shit on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a weird way.</v>

1977
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.480
<v Speaker 3>You get to like reinforce racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really.</v>

1978
01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking counterproductive too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you do that then it just</v>

1979
01:33:09.081 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 3>makes people just get defensive on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>

1980
01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.270
<v Speaker 3>They don't even want to even think or</v>
<v Speaker 3>empathize with how you are.</v>

1981
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.720
<v Speaker 2>What social media has really made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything annoying has made me think</v>

1982
01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.280
<v Speaker 2>great too though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both do twitter is like we're saying</v>

1983
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:27.940
<v Speaker 2>when someone says something dumb like</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump will say something dumb sometimes</v>

1984
01:33:27.941 --> 01:33:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and I'll just go there for the memes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just read his post and it'll get me</v>

<v Speaker 4>ground and then tied her up for six</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2051
01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:22.810
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soulja boy.</v>

2053
01:36:27.311 --> 01:36:30.670

<v Speaker 2>but that sounds like that sounds like a</v>

2054
01:36:30.671 --> 01:36:34.000
<v Speaker 2>fucking disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2055
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You never hear about the spin doctors</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing any problems.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This all started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She heard it.</v>

2058
01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:42.040
<v Speaker 2>She hit a curb with his car or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2059
01:36:42.041 --> 01:36:44.410
<v Speaker 2>She's curb one of his wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't enough information on there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2061
01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:49.570

<v Speaker 2>It was a nice car and she didn't know</v>

<v Speaker 2>what the fuck she was doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that old man putting the ice on the</v>

<v Speaker 2>ground and then pretending he fell.</v>

2072
01:37:11.891 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no allegedly lead for that.</v>

2073
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:15.850
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing to watch because he didn't</v>

2074
01:37:15.851 --> 01:37:19.030
<v Speaker 2>know there was a security camera there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tried to collect.</v>

2075
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that do that,</v>

2076
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen videos of people doing that at</v>

2077
01:37:22.391 --> 01:37:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll like throw a drink down and then</v>

2078
01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:27.190
<v Speaker 2>slide down on the drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a guy do it once at a movie</v>

2079
01:37:27.191 --> 01:37:30.580
<v Speaker 2>theater I worked at and we had it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>video also and we just showed them the</v>

2080
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:32.830
<v Speaker 2>video and then he left and never heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>

2081
01:37:32.831 --> 01:37:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but he was bitching up a storm like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hurt was me.</v>

2082
01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:37.180
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's hilarious.</v>

2083
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.000
<v Speaker 2>So he's walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks around chuck some ice on the</v>

2084
01:37:40.001 --> 01:37:41.860
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of a nightstand.</v>

2085
01:37:41.861 --> 01:37:44.380
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go over here and la Di da Di</v>

2086
01:37:44.381 --> 01:37:46.250

2087
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks around and make sure no one's</v>

2088
01:37:48.101 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2089
01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Even felt like a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like holding is the most ridiculous</v>

2090
01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That silly,</v>

2091
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:58.440
<v Speaker 3>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silly man.</v>

2092
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 3>The thing about those guys is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that does that kind of shit,</v>

2093
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I think the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they have to do is go,</v>

2094
01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>sure what's your social security number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they look up all the shit that he's</v>

2095
01:38:09.211 --> 01:38:11.820
<v Speaker 3>also done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't that even just a little</v>

2096
01:38:11.821 --> 01:38:12.654
<v Speaker 3>bit of a scam.</v>

2097
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:17.720
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy who's been scam and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in Russia and stuff or other</v>

2098
01:38:17.721 --> 01:38:20.150
<v Speaker 4>countries where everyone's doing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance scams.</v>

2099
01:38:20.151 --> 01:38:23.240
<v Speaker 4>And so to the point where everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have dash cams on their car.</v>

2100
01:38:23.241 --> 01:38:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a lot of that just triggered</v>
<v Speaker 4>a story I heard over the weekend.</v>

2101
01:38:27.171 --> 01:38:28.390
<v Speaker 4>There was a not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2102
01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.020
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a story happening in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Houston where the cops broke into a</v>

2103
01:38:33.021 --> 01:38:35.720
<v Speaker 4>house where they had heard that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>was or they think they had a warrant.</v>

2104
01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.640
<v Speaker 4>A report was that neighbors had called</v>
<v Speaker 4>and black tar heroin sales or something</v>

2105
01:38:40.641 --> 01:38:44.690
<v Speaker 4>like that at this house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they broke in without knocking.</v>

2106
01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:46.820
<v Speaker 4>It was like a no knock warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2107
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:49.730
<v Speaker 4>the guys like 57 in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's someone break into his house,</v>

2108
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:53.840
<v Speaker 4>gets a shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoots one of the cops that killed him.</v>

2109
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:55.940
<v Speaker 4>His wife is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck's going on?</v>

2110
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>She goes to try to grab the other cops</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun that had just fallen.</v>

2111
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.960
<v Speaker 4>She gets shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two people are dead and they didn't find</v>

2112
01:39:02.961 --> 01:39:04.980
<v Speaker 4>any heroine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Geez.</v>

2113
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.980
<v Speaker 4>There's like some weed in there or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2114
01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.480
<v Speaker 4>And some people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have a history of doing much</v>

2115
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:13.620
<v Speaker 4>from what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I thought of it because they</v>

2116
01:39:13.621 --> 01:39:15.560
<v Speaker 4>look back with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have an arrest history or</v>

2117
01:39:15.561 --> 01:39:16.970
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't anything that they had</v>

2118
01:39:16.971 --> 01:39:18.440
<v Speaker 4>found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least what I read about it.</v>

2119
01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the one where there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mayor outside of Washington DC and he,</v>

2120
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:26.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were using his house as an address</v>

2121
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:31.520
<v Speaker 3>and it was something with the mail</v>
<v Speaker 3>delivery guy was running weed.</v>

2122
01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.400
<v Speaker 3>And so the mail delivery guy would come</v>
<v Speaker 3>by and uh,</v>

2123
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:40.040
<v Speaker 3>the package was addressed to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would just keep the package</v>

2124
01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:42.560
<v Speaker 3>because he knew that this was this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

2125
01:39:42.561 --> 01:39:44.840
<v Speaker 3>It was on his route and that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2126
01:39:44.841 --> 01:39:47.360
<v Speaker 3>as the package came into mail would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>his to deliver,</v>

2127
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:49.190
<v Speaker 3>but instead of delivering it he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold onto it.</v>

2128
01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:52.130
<v Speaker 3>So they break into the mayor's house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2129
01:39:52.131 --> 01:39:56.960
<v Speaker 3>You know the whole shoot his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs shoon his dog and he had like one</v>

2130
01:39:56.961 --> 01:40:00.770
<v Speaker 3>of my dog like Marshall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like a super duper sweet dog,</v>

2131
01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.930
<v Speaker 3>either yellow lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is real similar.</v>

2132
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might've been golden retriever.</v>

2133
01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Either way they fucking shot at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his dogs.</v>

2134
01:40:08.751 --> 01:40:11.180
<v Speaker 3>How did they not know that was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mayor's house you think that would be</v>

2135
01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 3>like on a list day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't Google shit or maybe they did.</v>

2136
01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they thought fucking the mayors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A drug dealer.</v>

2137
01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they really thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that kind of shit is dark man.</v>

2138
01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.540
<v Speaker 3>We just go shoot a golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

2139
01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:29.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not a pussy and I know you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going in there because you think that</v>

2140
01:40:29.271 --> 01:40:31.850
<v Speaker 3>this is a real drug running operation</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the cops just got bad</v>

2141
01:40:31.851 --> 01:40:32.684
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2142
01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.820
<v Speaker 3>But you're not a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to shoot a fucking</v>

<v Speaker 3>labrador stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that things going to bite you</v>

<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to play you the fuck out of</v>

2145

<v Speaker 3>then you shoot his fucking dog.</v>

2151

<v Speaker 3>What if you're wrong?</v>

<v Speaker 2>of their kids.</v>

2154

<v Speaker 2>That's what happened to the mayor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this town.</v>

2155
01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.840
<v Speaker 2>The fucking mayor.</v>

2156
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Just thought it was cute to use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayor's address.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Get all the weed delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you didn't.</v>

2158
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:13.330

<v Speaker 2>He thought it was safer to do it that</v>

2159
01:41:13.331 --> 01:41:14.910
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had to get one.</v>

2163
01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in Moscow.</v>

2164
01:41:22.831 --> 01:41:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I would get one guy did my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost solid.</v>

2165
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man of my word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2166
01:41:28.141 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest thing I've ever driven</v>

2167
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:34.210
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

2168
01:41:34.211 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even.</v>

2169
01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:40.150
<v Speaker 2>There's not a single car that I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>driven that's even close to his fast.</v>

2170
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my porsche is so slow.</v>

2171
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I have a gt three Rs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has 518 horsepower.</v>

2172
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Waste 3000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a dragon.</v>

2173
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.290
<v Speaker 2>And that Tesla would leave it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dust.</v>

2174
01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave it in the dust like zero to 62</v>

2175
01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:02.911
<v Speaker 2>seconds quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane and out of a no.</v>

2176
01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2177
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it in chill mode for a little</v>

2178
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:08.620
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could drive chill with ludicrous</v>

2179
01:42:08.621 --> 01:42:09.610
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always available.</v>

2180
01:42:09.611 --> 01:42:12.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to keep switching back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And little mode is just crazy,</v>

2181
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:15.310
<v Speaker 2>like the fastest and it kills your</v>
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>

2182
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kills your battery quicker,</v>

2183
01:42:16.781 --> 01:42:20.290
<v Speaker 2>but the thrust that you get is a roller</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaster ride.</v>

2184
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.640
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2185
01:42:21.641 --> 01:42:23.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't believe how fast it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even.</v>

2186
01:42:23.931 --> 01:42:26.830
<v Speaker 2>It literally doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem right.</v>

2187
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It seems like like it's punching its way</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a wormhole use an alien</v>

2188
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:32.434
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

2189
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile I posted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like something Bob was our</v>

2190
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 2>snuck out of area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get all these messages from people.</v>

2191
01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 2>&lt;Unk&gt; has been debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's controlled opposition.</v>

2192
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a fake story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake news bro.</v>

2193
01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:49.420
<v Speaker 2>They got you with the Bob Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you like all the tech in it?</v>

2194
01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much almost because it's this</v>

2195
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:55.090
<v Speaker 2>giant screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a dim it where the fuck down</v>

2196
01:42:55.091 --> 01:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>because I was looking at it like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>so pretty,</v>

2197
01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.720
<v Speaker 2>so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so pretty.</v>

2198
01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Dream car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very comfortable.</v>

2199
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super comfortable.</v>

2200
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Now do you have a supercharged station</v>
<v Speaker 2>at your house yet or do you thing on the</v>

2201
01:43:06.551 --> 01:43:09.010
<v Speaker 2>wall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At my house that I can plug it into a</v>

2202
01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:10.700
<v Speaker 2>supercharger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes like eight hours.</v>

2203
01:43:10.701 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Eight hours or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many miles,</v>

2204
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:15.010
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to get one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get one of those fast</v>

2205
01:43:15.011 --> 01:43:20.011
<v Speaker 2>charger in the house because allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean allegedly 311 miles.</v>

2206
01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the fuel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem.</v>

2207
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I drive like a mall wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not going that far.</v>

2208
01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Did you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a few option for that model and</v>

2209
01:43:29.131 --> 01:43:32.050
<v Speaker 2>like are you cool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a fuel add on that gives</v>

2210
01:43:32.051 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you an extra like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2211
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought you meant a fuel</v>

2212
01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.220
<v Speaker 2>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2213
01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking to?</v>

2214
01:43:40.651 --> 01:43:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Some models will not tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2215
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just making shit up bro.</v>

2216
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

2217
01:43:45.581 --> 01:43:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was car.</v>

2218
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It is</v>
<v Speaker 2>extra for like one gallon of gas.</v>

2219
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>So like</v>

2220
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.510
<v Speaker 4>if you ever lose your battery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have heard of that.</v>

2221
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

2222
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I thought Tesla had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2223
01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:57.941
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2224
01:43:57.941 --> 01:44:00.940
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like a Prius.</v>

2225
01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Prius is our mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hybrids.</v>

2226
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Prius's use gasoline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a very stingy amount of gasoline.</v>

2227
01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.440
<v Speaker 3>They run partially on electric motors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Do,</v>

2228
01:44:11.441 --> 01:44:13.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Acura NSX.</v>

2229
01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:18.280
<v Speaker 3>The ACURA NSX has two electric motors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you don't ever charge it.</v>

2230
01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.320
<v Speaker 3>I think the electric motors are powered</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the gasoline engine and electricity</v>

2231
01:44:23.321 --> 01:44:24.400
<v Speaker 3>in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember right.</v>

2232
01:44:24.610 --> 01:44:29.140
<v Speaker 3>That's supposed to be the motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Acura Nsx is supposed to be the</v>

2233
01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:33.100
<v Speaker 3>car that people are underlooked under</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for whatever reason,</v>

2234
01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.290
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't get the love that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserves.</v>

2235
01:44:35.291 --> 01:44:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And apparently the 2019 models even more</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

2236
01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.370
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait to the day where like your</v>
<v Speaker 4>garage floor is like a wireless charging</v>

2237
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:45.890
<v Speaker 4>mat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just pull right up into the mat or</v>

2238
01:44:45.891 --> 01:44:47.660
<v Speaker 4>they would never would be because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber.</v>

2239
01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Well there I'm sure they're fine because</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a,</v>

2240
01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.340
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like if you,</v>

2241
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 4>if you take your phone and put it on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>wireless charger,</v>

2242
01:44:53.241 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 4>there's like a little room that if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to touch it,</v>

2243
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:59.030
<v Speaker 4>like maybe that's the whole reason why</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're safe from getting hit by</v>

2244
01:44:59.031 --> 01:45:00.190
<v Speaker 4>lightning bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2245
01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rubber protects you from</v>

2246
01:45:01.971 --> 01:45:04.070
<v Speaker 4>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parco a little thing comes down to the</v>

2247
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that thing falls out while you're</v>

2248
01:45:07.161 --> 01:45:09.970
<v Speaker 4>driving your car over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or did they?</v>

2249
01:45:09.971 --> 01:45:13.070
<v Speaker 4>If the streets like if somehow like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were riding on the highway and if</v>

2250
01:45:13.071 --> 01:45:16.070
<v Speaker 4>you want to fuel up that you can like</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel up using the road.</v>

2251
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Like pay like a fee or something.</v>

2252
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Ideally it would be great if solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>panels had gotten so powerful.</v>

2253
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:27.340
<v Speaker 3>They can charge it just with the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because southern California</v>

2254
01:45:27.341 --> 01:45:29.210
<v Speaker 3>is always fucking sunny except for</v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

2255
01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cars of the future.</v>

2256
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2257
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a giant fan of American muscle cars</v>

2258
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:39.320
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My all time favorite cars in terms of</v>

2259
01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:42.650
<v Speaker 3>like to drive to hear the rumble of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>engine and that I love them.</v>

2260
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the</v>

2261
01:45:47.451 --> 01:45:50.300

<v Speaker 3>sixties muscle cars.</v>

2262
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that fucking cars,</v>

2264
01:45:54.771 --> 01:45:56.510

<v Speaker 3>that Tesla is the future.</v>

2265
01:45:56.511 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Like when you drive it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>

2266
01:45:57.830 --> 01:46:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other cars are stupid.</v>

2268
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.020
<v Speaker 4>That's that new room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Crazy rocket today.</v>

2269
01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Shooting rockets out in his backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that his house?</v>

2270
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything that you don't like on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day or something that kind of bugs</v>

2271
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:12.130
<v Speaker 4>you that you wish was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's no door handles.</v>

2273
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2274
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:15.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2275
01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to figure it out.</v>

2276
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:20.890
<v Speaker 3>It just takes a little while to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what all different buttons do and</v>

2277
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:22.480
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get things to happen,</v>

2278
01:46:22.481 --> 01:46:25.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's really well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a look.</v>

2279
01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a legit genius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2280
01:46:28.241 --> 01:46:31.770
<v Speaker 3>and what he's doing is unprecedented and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2281
01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:34.240
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna sound like I'm kissing his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass because I liked him because he did</v>

2282
01:46:34.241 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 3>the podcast and then I became friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

2283
01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Know he's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys got ideas that are of a</v>

2284
01:46:41.591 --> 01:46:44.740
<v Speaker 3>magnitude that dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you and me are never going to come</v>

2285
01:46:44.741 --> 01:46:48.040
<v Speaker 3>up with any of those ideas ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we lived a thousand lives,</v>

2286
01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 3>we would never figure out space x.</v>

2287
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 2>it's just not in our wheelhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would never make a fucking electric</v>

2288
01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never make one of those things.</v>

2289
01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Never make a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Tesla roadster that's going to come</v>

2290
01:46:57.181 --> 01:46:59.580
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes zero to 60 in one point nine</v>

2291
01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:03.390
<v Speaker 2>seconds and looks like like a spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2292
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 2>like a race car spaceship from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

2293
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>We're not doing that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need people like that.</v>

2294
01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are super important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a.</v>

2295
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>he's like a a culture changer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a legit culture changer.</v>

2296
01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:20.150
<v Speaker 2>He got him to smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus they want to do is the ad blocker</v>

2297
01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.060
<v Speaker 2>bus to want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward to new Toyota supra.</v>

2298
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:28.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks Dope.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built a stainless steel rocket ship in</v>

2301
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Texas that looks like liquid silver and</v>
<v Speaker 2>might launch in February.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What Day is this article?</v>

2303
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:47.420
<v Speaker 2>January 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple weeks ago.</v>

2304
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fell over and I know that they've</v>

2305
01:47:49.710 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 2>been doing stuff more with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just how cool it looks it looks</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I mean it did now.</v>

2307
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.160
<v Speaker 2>It fell on the ground while I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there.</v>

2308
01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:56.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:47:56.791 --> 01:48:01.020
<v Speaker 2>It got blown over the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a drawing for a rocket</v>

2310
01:48:01.021 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>from the 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he did it on purpose,</v>

2311
01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:06.900
<v Speaker 2>but it looks just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a fucking movie.</v>

2312
01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:11.901
<v Speaker 2>Like buck Rogers Rogers rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2313
01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 2>It looks dope though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger's do.</v>

2314
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Driving that car really feels like like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

2315
01:48:18.481 --> 01:48:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And did you get the best model or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2316
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Of course he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2317
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I got the model s p 100 ds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it's called.</v>

2318
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I just paid off my car and might just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell it and get one of those.</v>

2319
01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:34.880
<v Speaker 2>So have a place to park it that has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little charge port.</v>

2320
01:48:34.881 --> 01:48:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have it in a power outlet.</v>

2321
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd probably convert it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2322
01:48:39.121 --> 01:48:39.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2323
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of superchargers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burbank.</v>

2324
01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one across the street,</v>

2325
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:44.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's always taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the.</v>

2326
01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:46.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's weird man passing by gas stations</v>

2327
01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to use it with this.</v>

2328
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I've never pull it in there unless I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want a soda.</v>

2329
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's zero to 60 in one point nine</v>

2330
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:57.090
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm telling you,</v>

2331
01:48:57.091 --> 01:48:58.740
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an unrealistic number.</v>

2332
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Six hundred 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2333
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when does this come out?</v>

2334
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:04.590
<v Speaker 2>A couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be awhile.</v>

2335
01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get at 100 percent by your</v>

2336
01:49:09.241 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 2>old one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is such a dope car,</v>

2337
01:49:11.131 --> 01:49:11.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

2338
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Why has it not have a side mirror?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got no side mirrors as cameras.</v>

2339
01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the rendering of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably shut your mouth.</v>

2340
01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:22.050
<v Speaker 2>God Damn side mirror you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sons of bitches.</v>

2341
01:49:22.090 --> 01:49:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my camera cameras on my car.</v>

2342
01:49:25.351 --> 01:49:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't even use my side mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much better having that look at</v>

2343
01:49:28.531 --> 01:49:30.390
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much is that?</v>

2344
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:31.860
<v Speaker 2>600.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty miles.</v>

2345
01:49:31.861 --> 01:49:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably stupid.</v>

2346
01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how pretty it is.</v>

2347
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 2>It's too pretty to be cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got fucking sick.</v>

2348
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:38.940
<v Speaker 2>That thing looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

2349
01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the ultimate sports car</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that looks like a.</v>

2350
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.330
<v Speaker 2>That easily could be a new nine slash</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

2351
01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Like from that angle particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the roof comes off.</v>

2352
01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Cameras Look at those game receipts</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

2353
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2354
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what racing seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they were racing seats first</v>

2355
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:56.810
<v Speaker 2>and then became gamers.</v>

2356
01:49:57.130 --> 01:49:59.830
<v Speaker 2>But the steering wheel's wonky steering</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheels.</v>

2357
01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Like a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a formula one car.</v>

2358
01:50:02.171 --> 01:50:02.861
<v Speaker 2>See it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2359
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:03.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you grab it by the handles.</v>

2361
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they want to make sure that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do this kind of shit like you.</v>

2362
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 2>This is so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably need to hold onto it in a</v>

2363
01:50:14.681 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2364
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you that the car that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I got beautiful.</v>

2365
01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I've never experienced anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that before.</v>

2366
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think a car can do that?</v>

2367
01:50:25.421 --> 01:50:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want her $45,000?</v>

2368
01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chop back chat.</v>

2369
01:50:31.781 --> 01:50:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's five plus the 5,000.</v>

2370
01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Fifty thousand to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>It's probably gonna sell out in five</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds to pay it.</v>

2372
01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every dickhead in Hollywood will have</v>

2373
01:50:43.451 --> 01:50:44.410
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>

2374
01:50:44.411 --> 01:50:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm environmentally conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still success look like I'm an open</v>

2375
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 2>shirt to do.</v>

2376
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:49.481
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2377
01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:49.841
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2378
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:52.390
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went into a volt the other day as an</v>

2379
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:54.010
<v Speaker 2>uber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is amazed by that.</v>

2380
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a hybrid right now.</v>

2381
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:58.400
<v Speaker 2>It's all electric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2382
01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean it had like five different</v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras and it was pretty sweet.</v>

2383
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Did he ask him how long the range is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>he?</v>

2384
01:51:03.771 --> 01:51:05.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't as good as I think of.</v>

2385
01:51:05.321 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like 2:30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said that's not bad though.</v>

2386
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 2>If you drive it around Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could probably get a whole night and</v>

2387
01:51:11.250 --> 01:51:14.470
<v Speaker 2>you know if you're ubering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Audi just announced theirs yesterday</v>

2388
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:15.970
<v Speaker 2>with a super bowl commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2389
01:51:15.971 --> 01:51:17.200
<v Speaker 2>it looks nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

2390
01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 2>It looks for honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2391
01:51:18.461 --> 01:51:20.890
<v Speaker 2>it looks nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jesse Jackson.</v>

2392
01:51:20.891 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Nastier bad nasties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Jackson and it looks like A.</v>

2393
01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of the r eight they took</v>

2394
01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:32.780
<v Speaker 2>kit that I get the look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stupid girl.</v>

2395
01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.080
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a regular Audi's what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like,</v>

2396
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>but a Audi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google a audi electric sportscar.</v>

2397
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:45.280
<v Speaker 2>There's one that doesn't look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a stock standard suv.</v>

2398
01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 2>That looks pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second Mile on that thing.</v>

2399
01:51:48.941 --> 01:51:51.160
<v Speaker 2>What's the mileage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The range.</v>

2400
01:51:51.161 --> 01:51:52.480
<v Speaker 2>The range is everything on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2401
01:51:52.481 --> 01:51:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's anything below like 300</v>

2402
01:51:55.901 --> 01:51:59.230
<v Speaker 2>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 back up comparing it,</v>

2403
01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.650
<v Speaker 2>it's comparing the amount of time you</v>
<v Speaker 2>charge it and what it takes to charge to</v>

2404
01:52:02.651 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 2>get certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2405
01:52:03.701 --> 01:52:05.320
<v Speaker 2>the model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The final model.</v>

2406
01:52:05.321 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does 144 miles and 160 miles.</v>

2407
01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.510
<v Speaker 2>That ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on that trip.</v>

2408
01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.280
<v Speaker 2>On that kind of charger or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2409
01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't estimate.</v>

2410
01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 2>That ain't good after 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only after 30 minutes.</v>

2411
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you get in 30 minutes?</v>

2412
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good info.</v>

2413
01:52:21.690 --> 01:52:25.720
<v Speaker 2>So you can get 160 miles where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>charge in 30 minutes.</v>

2414
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:27.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faster.</v>

2415
01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got to go somewhere.</v>

2416
01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a rush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just pull it and get gas,</v>

2417
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want the kind of power</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would it take.</v>

2418
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you imagine how many dip shit.</v>

2419
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:39.840
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

2420
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:41.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the Audi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing Brian.</v>

2421
01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

2422
01:52:44.471 --> 01:52:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I like that better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2423
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.720
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one.</v>

2424
01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:50.570
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically an Audi r eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a next generation Audi r eight.</v>

2425
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Go to the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

2426
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a nasty looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dope electric</v>

2427
01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.640

<v Speaker 2>they announced it back at the car shows</v>

2428
01:53:04.251 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just probably what they're calling.</v>

2429
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 2>See Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if it actually is a real thing or is</v>

2430
01:53:10.521 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 2>it still just a concept because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always like,</v>

2431
01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those cars.</v>

2432
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:18.620
<v Speaker 2>They'll disappoint shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred $79.</v>

2433

2438
01:53:28.491 --> 01:53:30.710

<v Speaker 2>But look how they get your Dick hard</v>

<v Speaker 2>So rude though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>environmental but I'm going to show,</v>

2446
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:48.210

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2447
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the new Volkswagen Dune</v>
<v Speaker 2>buggy?</v>

2448
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.140
<v Speaker 2>That looks pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2449
01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cell.</v>

2450
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:57.440
<v Speaker 2>A Dune buggy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just announced.</v>

2451
01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if when it's for sale or if</v>

2452
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 2>it's for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks pretty fun.</v>

2453
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a classic Dune Buggy,</v>

2454
01:54:03.921 --> 01:54:08.000
<v Speaker 2>but they vote Volkswagen date and it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>no roof,</v>

2455
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.190
<v Speaker 2>but it was like a little fun car and on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third see a picture of that and um,</v>

2456
01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:16.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2457
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.770
<v Speaker 2>So it looks kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2459
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could drive that on the road.</v>

2460
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a road car,</v>

2461
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 2>but is it still a Dune buggy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty to 25 again,</v>

2462
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you sons of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks fun.</v>

2463
01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were supposed to announce the new</v>

2464
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thought it was going to happen</v>

2465
01:54:41.031 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 2>at the Detroit auto show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it came and went,</v>

2466
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:48.830
<v Speaker 2>came and went with no bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes no sense that because it's</v>

2467
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.950
<v Speaker 2>actually on their website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were going to announce it soon</v>

2468
01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:53.330
<v Speaker 2>as for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

2469
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they said that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna they probably don't have it down.</v>

2470
01:54:56.481 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when they're working on these</v>

2471
01:54:58.071 --> 01:55:01.460
<v Speaker 2>experimental vehicles they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll develop something but then they</v>

2472
01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:05.060
<v Speaker 2>don't like certain aspects of it or then</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they are aware of a competitors</v>

2473
01:55:05.061 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 2>work that might come out with more</v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower.</v>

2474
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:08.900
<v Speaker 2>So they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>

2475
01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:09.890
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2476
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.360
<v Speaker 2>the gt $500 from Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2477
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it was on its way out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we're going to put it out the new</v>

2478
01:55:17.661 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were saying that it has over</v>

2479
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:23.510
<v Speaker 2>700 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

2480
01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:26.270
<v Speaker 2>They never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always give you the exact specific</v>

2481
01:55:26.271 --> 01:55:29.440
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always say 750 horsepower is coming</v>

2482
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:30.800
<v Speaker 2>in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 there website.</v>

2483
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But did,</v>

2484
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they didn't show it at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going to make a special day for</v>

2485
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:38.270
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be interested in going to be</v>

2486
01:55:38.271 --> 01:55:39.770
<v Speaker 2>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look and see what it looks like.</v>

2487
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:42.660
<v Speaker 2>It looks cool as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2488
01:55:43.130 --> 01:55:44.790
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the Ford website doesn't have</v>

2489
01:55:44.791 --> 01:55:46.230
<v Speaker 2>pictures of it because they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>released it yet.</v>

2490
01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2491
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 2>what was I just saying?</v>

2492
01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 2>What was I just saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said we're talking about what before</v>

2493
01:55:57.601 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 2>the Bronco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Volkswagen Beetle bug.</v>

2494
01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying the Bronco.</v>

2495
01:56:05.150 --> 01:56:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie fucked me about how that's getting</v>

2496
01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 2>pushed back because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who might like,</v>

2497
01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>this car's faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:16.880
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shelby gt 500.</v>

2499
01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:19.850
<v Speaker 2>They said it's only so it's over 700</v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower.</v>

2500
01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:24.060
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they said that is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>dodge came out with the demon and then</v>

2501
01:56:24.061 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 2>they came out with some other version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hellcat.</v>

2502
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 2>It's also an 800 horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you come out with only 700</v>

2503
01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 2>horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because is ridiculous as that</v>

2504
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 2>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people gonna think you,</v>

2505
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the Zr one that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven 50 or it's not that this or that.</v>

2506
01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't said exactly what the</v>

2507
01:56:44.431 --> 01:56:46.920
<v Speaker 2>horsepower rating is because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still trying to juice it up.</v>

2508
01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:49.080
<v Speaker 2>That might be the case of the Bronco</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2509
01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:51.780
<v Speaker 2>They might be trying to fix things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose things,</v>

2510
01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but look how good that looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Red with the black stripes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the difference between that and</v>

2513
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:04.200
<v Speaker 2>like a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's exciting about that car?</v>

2514
01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>The way it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a ridiculous person's car.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you definitely smoke cigars,</v>

2518
01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably order shots,</v>

2519
01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:21.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a ridiculous person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>

2522
01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:30.690
<v Speaker 2>The transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only is it an automatic,</v>

2523
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you spend a drive like fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shift.</v>

2527
01:57:44.671 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the last places on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2528
01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:48.570
<v Speaker 2>We could still get a goddamn stick</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifts.</v>

2529
01:57:48.571 --> 01:57:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Sports car and what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they release the GT 500 with an</v>

<v Speaker 2>automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

2531
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk to me about paddles both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shift it manually with the</v>

2532
01:57:58.741 --> 01:57:59.574
<v Speaker 2>paddle.</v>

2533
01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:04.660
<v Speaker 2>That's not a manual transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

2534
01:58:04.661 --> 01:58:06.040
<v Speaker 2>That's shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with the paddles.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How about give me a fake clutch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I guess they haven't announced it yet so</v>

2545
01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.780

<v Speaker 2>specific data comes out,</v>

2546
01:58:29.590 --> 01:58:32.320

<v Speaker 3>transmission is the transmission from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular automatic Mustang and it just</v>

<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2617
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem getting sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got plenty of sponsors.</v>

2618
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:57.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a good sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked them.</v>

2619
02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>They do good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They donate $5 to UFC fighter Ray Borg</v>

2620
02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:04.880
<v Speaker 3>son's medical bills for every time</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone uses the code Joe Rogan.</v>

2621
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:09.560
<v Speaker 3>So I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had them as a sponsor and I</v>

2622
02:02:09.561 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 3>couldn't talk freely with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be happy if they dropped me,</v>

2623
02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I would be way happier for them to drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>me than I would for me to say something</v>

2624
02:02:18.411 --> 02:02:21.170
<v Speaker 3>different or not say something because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a sponsor.</v>

2625
02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds very self serving,</v>

2626
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:25.870
<v Speaker 3>like you would say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2627
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.370
<v Speaker 3>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all I can tell you.</v>

2628
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:30.920
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's it for today.</v>

2629
02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bye to everybody.</v>

2630
02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I see ya.</v>
