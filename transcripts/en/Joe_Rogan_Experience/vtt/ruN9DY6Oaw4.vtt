<v Speaker 1>like spy bar where there's like nobody.</v>

68
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.184
<v Speaker 1>And you walk in and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be on the up and up and I sit </v>

69
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>at this table with this guy just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to take the tour guide and be</v>

70
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me everything.</v>

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.013
<v Speaker 1>And I'll do that for a couple of days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try and get a real understanding of </v>

72
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.224
<v Speaker 1>where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just leave the hotel or the </v>

73
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

74
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm staying in with my camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my backpack with some water and I just </v>

75
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>start walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

76
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the street.</v>

77
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at that slum where that village or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that souk or that bizarre and I go.</v>

78
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And so far all 10 fingers still work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been to about 100 countries and</v>

79
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.504
<v Speaker 1>all seven continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only times I've almost been </v>

80
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was twice was,</v>

81
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.383
<v Speaker 1>was America by comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the world has been very </v>

82
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.904
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were the places where you're </v>

83
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.493
<v Speaker 1>almost killed in America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In California a couple of times nearly </v>

84
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>stabbed to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

85
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>a guy shot at me and my friend and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed my friend but didn't kill me.</v>

86
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a real close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of the world by comparison,</v>

88
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I was in Pakistan when Butoh was </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinated,</v>

89
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>she was killed in Rawalpindi.</v>

90
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.813
<v Speaker 1>I was in Islam of odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like few miles down the road and I was </v>

91
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.934
<v Speaker 1>there for a week because they are port </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut down and I went outside every day </v>

92
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>and no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just asked if I was lost,</v>

93
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.534
<v Speaker 1>if I needed help getting back the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was like a journalist or </v>

94
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.941
<v Speaker 1>embassy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

95
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a traveler.</v>

96
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And they said basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

97
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>you have to see our country in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

98
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

99
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get to judge.</v>

100
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had the travel experiences all over</v>

101
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:17.371
<v Speaker 1>the world where I'm met by just amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity and kindness and humility and</v>

102
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>informs kind of how I comport myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I try and do.</v>

103
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

104
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I try to live an eventful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

105
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.114
<v Speaker 1>I work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by chance like you give me six </v>

106
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>weeks off right now.</v>

107
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just whip out my high Rez jeff file of</v>

108
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the map of the world and I pick one </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and go,</v>

109
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll just go east from there.</v>

110
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongolia,</v>

111
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Bhutan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tibet,</v>

112
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to La.</v>

113
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get back to this.</v>

114
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.214
<v Speaker 1>But what happened with your friend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in California was this same sort of a </v>

115
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>thing where you just wanted to check out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place?</v>

116
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.514
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

118
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.353
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were robbed and the guy started </v>

119
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>shooting and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

120
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy killed my friend and put shot at</v>

121
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>me and just missed me very closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

122
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>that was a big turning point in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

123
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>that changed everything for 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

124
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.093
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

125
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes everything that you think </v>

126
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's every,</v>

127
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.104
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone goes through trauma </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that in their own way because it </v>

128
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>taps into everything you've ever done in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life beforehand.</v>

129
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a,</v>

130
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to be crass,</v>

131
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:30.901
<v Speaker 1>but that was a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the bigger topic of danger,</v>

132
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>the world is a dangerous place as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

133
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.964
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's to be feared because </v>

134
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>then you don't get anything done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

135
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you live in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in America.</v>

136
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Were the roughest room I've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

137
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a coast to coast,</v>

138
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>philly's flyer game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>we are blood and teeth on the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are because of freedom.</v>

140
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>We very free and people just walk up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smack you.</v>

141
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And I've never been to a country as free</v>
<v Speaker 1>as America.</v>

142
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I've been to countries that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More hectic,</v>

143
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 1>like don't get caught outside at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>like downtown Nairobi or you know,</v>

144
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>parts of Russia are kind of scary just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're living hard.</v>

145
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>But as far as a place where anything can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

146
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>America is like easily the hairiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>place I've ever been.</v>

147
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad was intense.</v>

148
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in Iraq for a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

149
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there on a Uso trip.</v>

150
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>So you're just kind of camping out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Green Zone.</v>

151
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

152
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.133
<v Speaker 2>initiated this crazy thirst for travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wanderlust that you've got </v>

153
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>something you've always had</v>

154
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 1>emanation of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was young,</v>

155
00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:32.694
<v Speaker 1>I was born and raised in Washington dc </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I lived down the road from the </v>

156
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 1>National Geographic Museum with the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale in the front and the Smithsonian.</v>

157
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It if whenever there was a snow day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>

158
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:44.040
<v Speaker 1>she worked for the government downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd like,</v>

159
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd get on the bus with her and we'd go </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown.</v>

160
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I spent the whole day at the Smithsonian</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur bones astronauts.</v>

161
00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:50.250
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.850
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating and my mom would save</v>

163
00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>up her meager pay and she would save up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

164
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art nut.</v>

165
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.830
<v Speaker 1>So we'd go hit the museums in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the museums in France,</v>

166
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>go to see all the islands in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to England,</v>

167
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.054
<v Speaker 1>see the National Museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Shakespeare and chaucer his </v>

168
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 1>handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time I was a little kid by</v>

169
00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:11.610
<v Speaker 1>11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 years old,</v>

170
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:12.444
<v Speaker 1>like fifth grade or thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been to Greece and Italy and </v>

171
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.310
<v Speaker 1>England and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different countries.</v>

172
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.143
<v Speaker 1>And so I kinda wanted more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you grow up with National </v>

173
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Geographic magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the pyramids,</v>

174
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you look at the sinks and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>

175
00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look real.</v>

176
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually I did go to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those places.</v>

177
00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:31.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

178
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I stood in front of the stinks more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

179
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:36.270
<v Speaker 1>And the Great Pyramid in Giza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bigger than you think.</v>

180
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like you kinda just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hypnotizes you stare at it all day.</v>

181
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Have you been recently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been for a few years,</v>

182
00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:44.880
<v Speaker 1>but I've been there like three times I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go.</v>

183
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>But it's just keep hearing sketchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about Egypt right now.</v>

184
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.393
<v Speaker 1>it is sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll always be sketchy because their </v>

186
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>GDP is you showing up and going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

187
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pyramids like you can see all,</v>

188
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.073
<v Speaker 1>you can see your hotel from the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made a highway that goes from </v>

189
00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 1>the cluster of hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Giza highway because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to see the pyramid.</v>

191
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they take you right there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven minutes.</v>

192
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.430
<v Speaker 1>You're standing in front of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are trying to sell you stuff.</v>

193
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I would go without hesitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never</v>

194
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to go.</v>

195
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy of mine has been on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast names John Anthony West and he's</v>

196
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 2>created these incredible DVD series </v>
<v Speaker 2>called magical Egypt.</v>

197
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>He's an egyptologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.380
<v Speaker 2>like one of the most knowledgeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of noise</v>

199
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>you can spend your whole life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>

200
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>One Dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>

201
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a casual fan.</v>

202
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.053
<v Speaker 2>I was planning on going with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately it was just diagnosed </v>

203
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.330
<v Speaker 2>with stage four cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of you might not know about that.</v>

204
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 2>If you do know and you hear you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can google it,</v>

205
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 2>but I put a link up before to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help him and that he's not good.</v>

206
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:50.424
<v Speaker 2>He's an older gentleman and he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been trying to educate people on </v>

207
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Egypt for a long because he's</v>

208
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a scholar when it comes to ancient </v>

209
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

210
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.773
<v Speaker 3>and he's one of those people that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>actively trying to kind of rewrite the </v>

211
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 3>history of Egypt as far as like how far </v>
<v Speaker 3>back it goes.</v>

212
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 3>They've got some pretty rock solid </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence to point to the idea that Egypt</v>

213
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 3>is a civilization that was probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

214
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 3>very advanced many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

215
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.034
<v Speaker 3>many thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some sort of a natural </v>

216
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably asteroidal impacts or something</v>

217
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 3>like that around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

218
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.823
<v Speaker 3>Sort of reset society and civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they rebuilt from there with </v>

219
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever was remained.</v>

220
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.410
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they benefited from having denial</v>

221
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.910
<v Speaker 1>because denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:38.930
<v Speaker 1>the water's rich with nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So agriculture was huge and people lived</v>

223
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 1>good lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

224
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the Nile is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's massive.</v>

225
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:41.954
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of it that are like still </v>

226
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 1>like a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you see it,</v>

227
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:46.334
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>in northern Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south Sudan,</v>

229
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.830
<v Speaker 1>like right when you cross the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go across this river,</v>

230
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.063
<v Speaker 1>category five Whitewater roaring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Nile has a lot of different </v>

232
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>phases to it.</v>

233
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.993
<v Speaker 3>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wanderlust that you have this like </v>

234
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 3>crazy touring thing where you just pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a spot and go,</v>

235
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 3>how long have you been doing that?</v>

236
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did conventional,</v>

237
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a lot of rock and roll and </v>

238
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get you all over Europe,</v>

239
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

240
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like that.</v>

241
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>But it won't get you to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morocco,</v>

242
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Tunisia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongolia necessarily.</v>

243
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And so in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:23.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else in this business you do </v>

245
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.584
<v Speaker 1>every interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said you're pretty well </v>

246
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 1>traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd always have to say,</v>

247
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.544
<v Speaker 1>well caveat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to the African </v>

248
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I went,</v>

249
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 1>well why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

250
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I did some research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you gotTa to do?</v>

251
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.523
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go get a bunch of shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of them makes you sick for </v>

252
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:41.454
<v Speaker 1>like a whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put so many vaccines into you and </v>

253
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:44.214
<v Speaker 1>so you go to the travel doctor and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>show him what countries you're going to </v>

254
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

255
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just line up syringes and they </v>

256
00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>got on either side of me and just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just were just Charlie Horsey me in both</v>

257
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 1>arms and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're,</v>

258
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>now you're ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just said,</v>

259
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to Kenya.</v>

260
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to a Maasai Mara and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzanian border to see giraffes and </v>

261
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>zebras and lions and all of that and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Messiah.</v>

262
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It was all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

263
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I went from there to a Madagascar </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just had Madagascar.</v>

264
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:10.764
<v Speaker 1>You'd better go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because I saw it one day I was on a </v>

265
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:13.194
<v Speaker 1>flight from Melbourne or Sydney to Perth</v>
<v Speaker 1>going across Australia and I was </v>

266
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>whipping up the map on the airplane </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

267
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's Madagascar.</v>

268
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:21.534
<v Speaker 1>I did not know I better go and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was one of the better trips I </v>

269
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at my office one day,</v>

270
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 1>near the end of 1997 I think.</v>

271
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.263
<v Speaker 1>And I know that black Sabbath is getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>back together with the original lineup </v>

272
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>to do two shows at the Birmingham Nec in</v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

273
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>So I called Sharon Osborne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

274
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this great idea,</v>

275
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.923
<v Speaker 1>I fly out and hang out with black </v>
<v Speaker 1>sabbath and broke down with a band and </v>

276
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:44.094
<v Speaker 1>go to band practice and have a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good time and you put me on the guest </v>

277
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>list for this shows and I hang out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

278
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the best time I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had knowing she'd hang up on me.</v>

279
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.173
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me call them and ask them if that's </v>

280
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>okay because I already knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know the rest of the guys.</v>

281
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And she called me later that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

282
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it's fine.</v>

283
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Here's the address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let us know when to expect you.</v>

284
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So I booked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I booked it around my trip to Africa.</v>

285
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 1>So I went a USA London bus up to Wales </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were practicing a taxi.</v>

286
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

287
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Ozzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His assistant came and got me.</v>

288
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So I hung out with Sabbath at band </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

289
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Me and the band full band rehearsals the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

290
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the shows,</v>

291
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the two reunion shows at the soundboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I flew to Kenya.</v>

292
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:30.514
<v Speaker 1>that was a good chunk of travel and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in South Africa after all of </v>

294
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>that and said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

295
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come to Africa once a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just started picking out different</v>

296
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.504
<v Speaker 1>chunks of it and it just started going </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was 20 years ago and I've been </v>

297
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:45.101
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

298
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>like 20 sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

299
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you never don't learn,</v>

300
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it the big book.</v>

301
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>It's where you learn about life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and you can learn that anywhere,</v>

302
00:12:57.101 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but you see big stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people who suffer,</v>

303
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>people who have no food or water </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

304
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.113
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about retirement and life </v>

305
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>insurance and vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of tribes,</v>

306
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no words or even ideas in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

307
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.243
<v Speaker 1>Like I was hanging out with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>maturity people once in Uganda a few </v>

308
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.713
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I had a translator is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinka guy who spoke I guess whatever a </v>

309
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 1>truly people speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

310
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 1>can you ask them if they have any words </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their language for life insurance,</v>

311
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 1>retirement or a vacation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they understood retirement.</v>

312
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:28.870
<v Speaker 1>You get too old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids take care of you,</v>

313
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.883
<v Speaker 1>but a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said you leave somewhere and you </v>

314
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to leave your home?</v>

315
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's where all your friends are in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and why would you ever do that?</v>

316
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.823
<v Speaker 1>Or like life insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the hell are you talking </v>

317
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:41.614
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start meeting people who their </v>

318
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.340
<v Speaker 1>sense of time and space is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bowl,</v>

319
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>there's some rice in it.</v>

320
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So like today I got tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see where you.</v>

321
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

322
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:53.074
<v Speaker 1>in December I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we really have a realistic </v>

323
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>expectation of being alive and breathing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in December and in your life,</v>

324
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you've no doubt thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

325
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>when I retire or whatever that means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you money,</v>

326
00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:04.354
<v Speaker 1>some kind of security up the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of the world where people </v>

327
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:07.594
<v Speaker 1>live their entire life 37 years and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a day of that kind of </v>

328
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the t shirt,</v>

329
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:17.821
<v Speaker 1>a stick and some shade and I try and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>as some voitier I'm trying to understand</v>

330
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:20.314
<v Speaker 1>the world and I can understand it by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading some books and seeing some </v>

331
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:23.314
<v Speaker 1>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing like getting out </v>

332
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:26.494
<v Speaker 1>into what Mark Twain called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory of phrase I stole from David </v>

333
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Lee Roth when he said it to me and David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee was actually a real inspiration to </v>

334
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:34.834
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of traveling because one time </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking and he just come back </v>

335
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>from open sea kayaking in the Pacific.</v>

336
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.373
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why is it Henry is because don't get </v>

337
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.470
<v Speaker 1>eaten today is a great thing to have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your to do list every once in awhile.</v>

338
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

339
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:50.584
<v Speaker 1>that is profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You what he was doing up until recently </v>

340
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.533
<v Speaker 1>he moved to Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anybody there and he was </v>

341
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:55.784
<v Speaker 1>taking Kendall lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So learning how to sword fight yet </v>

342
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Japanese master?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

343
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 1>With this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

344
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me.</v>

345
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 1>He called me one Sunday a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped him with his autobiography,</v>

346
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>so I worked with Dave really closely for</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

347
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:07.724
<v Speaker 1>many months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him when I was in black flag 30 </v>

348
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>some years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked by him at an art gallery.</v>

349
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

350
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black flag,</v>

351
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:17.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no way.</v>

352
00:15:17.381 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the van Halen guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We became best buddies,</v>

353
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>but he called me from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Japan and said,</v>

354
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

355
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>he's learning Japanese.</v>

356
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.703
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart and he is like learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and started speaking Japanese </v>

357
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>and he's just taking lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:30.314
<v Speaker 1>you said the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sword guy was just like every day </v>

359
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 1>just like you're stupid and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just breaking them down.</v>

360
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just got an apartment there.</v>

361
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.723
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockstar just gets like this normal </v>

362
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 1>apartment with his dog and just starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking Kendo lessons.</v>

363
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:45.314
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David's always had a greater </v>

364
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

365
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of discipline in me comes up </v>

366
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:52.454
<v Speaker 1>through martial arts since he was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think as someone else in his </v>

367
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 1>family's into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's been that way,</v>

368
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of discipline and you can see </v>

369
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy is very physical,</v>

370
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.183
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming from a real disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not messing around kind of aggression </v>

371
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:13.601
<v Speaker 1>and control and Dave really loves Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

372
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 1>he called me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm living in a small apartment.</v>

373
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my language lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my martial arts stuff.</v>

374
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing sword stuff for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time though.</v>

375
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always been involved in martial </v>

376
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>arts and even the way he sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>approached hedonism,</v>

377
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like it was sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an applied approach to hedonism,</v>

378
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 1>like his rock star lifestyle thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing.</v>

379
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

380
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.760
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of people get a chance to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

381
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.673
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>

382
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time he,</v>

383
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.920
<v Speaker 1>when we were working on his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

384
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go home to pass the dean and now and </v>

385
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:44.894
<v Speaker 1>then where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>born and raised in some of his high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school buddies,</v>

387
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>seemingly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Dave,</v>

388
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be nice,</v>

389
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being David Lee Roth and he.</v>

390
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

391
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>On graduation day from high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all were on the same starting blocks.</v>

392
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You chose the bank job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sure thing.</v>

393
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:00.764
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die in that cubicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I choose to sail the seas of </v>

394
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

395
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

396
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's daring.</v>

397
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:10.544
<v Speaker 1>And so he won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like he said it pretty good ride </v>

398
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I reckon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

399
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and so in my own way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from minimum wage work,</v>

401
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:18.944
<v Speaker 1>I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>music via punk rock because the band </v>

402
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 1>black flag said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

403
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you're a crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to try out to be our singer.</v>

404
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to lose?</v>

405
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:27.884
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for that and it led to </v>

406
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 1>everything else and ultimately why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in this room with you today.</v>

407
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss touring as a musician?</v>

408
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:38.774
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

409
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.613
<v Speaker 1>because I did it.</v>

410
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I did it really hard until I had nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>left to give to it.</v>

411
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And so now if I went back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just be repetition and it might</v>

412
00:17:48.831 --> 00:17:49.664
<v Speaker 1>be repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I </v>

413
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be putting out anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

414
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:56.184
<v Speaker 1>the day I stopped doing music was I woke</v>
<v Speaker 1>up one day and I just sat up and was </v>

415
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light bulb went on.</v>

416
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:01.981
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

417
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like,</v>

418
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:05.191
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

419
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well give me my scroll.</v>

420
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've graduated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was this?</v>

421
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just called the manager.</v>

422
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.293
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

423
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he saw a 15 percent of that though,</v>

424
00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

425
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

426
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:21.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

427
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

428
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 1>because I got nothing new to add these </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

429
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Then just go out and do the hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

430
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:27.114
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what coltrane would have </v>

431
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not with miles Davis would've done.</v>

432
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to repeat.</v>

433
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:32.304
<v Speaker 1>It's not artistically brave to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd much rather just try new </v>

434
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.094
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But thankfully by that time I was </v>

435
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 1>already doing talking tours all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they do very well,</v>

436
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of acting voiceover.</v>

437
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I had all this other stuff I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the book company,</v>

438
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 1>a record company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music publishing.</v>

439
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.214
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had all this other stuff and so I just </v>

440
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 1>kind of let all of that stuff fill in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it this way.</v>

441
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm busier now than ever and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>miss the music.</v>

442
00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I see bands in the airport all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the laminates in road gear,</v>

443
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

444
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 1>rumble young man rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my fill.</v>

445
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:09.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful that you did it on your </v>

446
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decided to do it.</v>

447
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.113
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like there's a lot of aging </v>

448
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:17.004
<v Speaker 1>rock stars that have that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence where they have to go out and </v>

449
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>do the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew shit.</v>

451
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have to do that weird circle</v>

452
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:26.724
<v Speaker 1>the wagons thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to play this album in </v>

453
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.470
<v Speaker 1>its entirety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

454
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I go to some of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

455
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I throw my money down and go see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>band,</v>

456
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 1>do that album in its entirety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool,</v>

457
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

458
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the stones still put on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome show.</v>

459
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the cool things about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like,</v>

460
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.240
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mick jagger can still fucking do it.</v>

461
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 1>He still apparently works out twice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

462
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing shame,</v>

463
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:51.170
<v Speaker 1>great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

464
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.170
<v Speaker 1>there's some people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

465
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 1>they're rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually,</v>

466
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.633
<v Speaker 1>it's not about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I really start trusting </v>

467
00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 1>those old rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime.</v>

468
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy can buy four countries right </v>

469
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:03.654
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably playing tonight and Las </v>

470
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Vegas or somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elton John.</v>

471
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>They just really liked doing the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,</v>

472
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 1>there'll be rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll die on stage and it's not money.</v>

473
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.951
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

474
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>we might get popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

475
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really want to play brown sugar.</v>

476
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I admire them.</v>

477
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's what I'm saying is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

478
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it is real.</v>

479
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's real with a lot of them,</v>

480
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.933
<v Speaker 1>but what I liked with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what you're saying is that you had </v>

481
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:30.114
<v Speaker 1>already figured out all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>paths in life that you were enjoying </v>

482
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:33.720
<v Speaker 1>putting your creative energy and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just decided,</v>

483
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 1>and I just.</v>

484
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I know it was summer 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84.</v>

485
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I was 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in black flag and we were touring.</v>

486
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.034
<v Speaker 1>We were staying out of California </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Olympics were coming and we </v>

487
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>knew the cops would just be looking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>smash down any supposed do wells.</v>

488
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So we just stayed on tour of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>year pretty much and I noticed all these</v>

489
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:52.744
<v Speaker 1>great bands around the very talented </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and everyone we're all broke </v>

490
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 1>between tours were like living like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>

491
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 1>If we don't like tor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat.</v>

492
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And between tours the guys in that band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all waiters and not putting that</v>

493
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 1>down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the music wasn't keeping you in rent</v>

494
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 1>12 months a year and I'm not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented as any of them.</v>

495
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:11.471
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

496
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Speaker 1>if there those guys are struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what am I going to do?</v>

497
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I better get plans B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

498
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:16.541
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

499
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.374
<v Speaker 1>F and g together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in those days I just started my </v>

500
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 1>little book publishing company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to work harder on writing.</v>

501
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to become much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start doing the talking shows.</v>

502
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:24.964
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get much better at that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start saying yes to things </v>

503
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>when they come along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years later,</v>

504
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood started calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

505
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 1>can you act them because well as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sing click,</v>

506
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 1>acting is crispin glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actor.</v>

508
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>One day he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

509
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:44.341
<v Speaker 1>Henry as a just please consider acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like just if you get an audition,</v>

510
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily say no just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the music guy.</v>

511
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might really like it and you</v>

512
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 1>could probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

513
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:54.064
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within a year I was doing film and </v>

514
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:57.161
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

515
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>can you do a voiceover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

516
00:21:58.571 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a voice.</v>

517
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And so I just started saying yes to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that was the plan.</v>

518
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:04.683
<v Speaker 1>Just have more things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine because I don't like </v>

519
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>sitting around anyway and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically music ended up being very,</v>

520
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>very good and all of that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had plans,</v>

521
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>other plans and I've noticed that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of old geezers around my era,</v>

522
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 1>they didn't come up with something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just,</v>

523
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why and they didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>another plan and they get put into those</v>

524
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 1>weird tours where there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.773
<v Speaker 1>you bring your kid all of that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more that they got to more than </v>

526
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:34.114
<v Speaker 1>they want to and I'd rather wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do stuff not having to do </v>

527
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:38.914
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like you were saying a while </v>

528
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:41.764
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like less obligation just so you clear </v>

529
00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the deck so you can really do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because life is short.</v>

530
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>56.</v>

531
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes by really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle</v>

532
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>or a prison cell and then you wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>

533
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

534
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.800
<v Speaker 1>that was fast and so you might as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it as much as what you wanted to be</v>

535
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>as possible because all you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is older.</v>

536
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people don't fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wake up everyday.</v>

537
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.000
<v Speaker 1>But with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

538
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>the grim reaper side whistling by my ear</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

539
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you better get up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all the up I need.</v>

540
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever sleep in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

541
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.380
<v Speaker 1>how many hours a night between a four </v>
<v Speaker 1>and five or six that's going to age.</v>

542
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't like sleeping.</v>

543
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Are you sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

544
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:27.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

545
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

546
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do stuff.</v>

547
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 1>But does not diminish your energy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

548
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.341
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

549
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I have those Uzi afternoons where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

550
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I take the seven minute power naps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

551
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>in my chair at the office.</v>

552
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.230
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

553
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I just try and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I have found,</v>

554
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>if you want to not have to sleep eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day,</v>

555
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>you maintain a really good diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can shave about an hour of sleep off</v>

556
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.024
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your proteins and your </v>

557
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates lean and stay away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>food that's really fun to eat burgers,</v>

558
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 1>French fries and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

559
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:56.624
<v Speaker 1>I'd live on that if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you keep your diet really </v>

560
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.423
<v Speaker 1>together and you keep your workouts up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have found that you want to like not </v>

561
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:06.224
<v Speaker 1>get tired during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout at five in the morning and the </v>

562
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>rest of the day you're just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzing where you think you'd face plant</v>

563
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 1>onto your desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when I'm really humming,</v>

564
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm up at 4:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in the gym by 4:55</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

577
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just started doing.</v>

578
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

579
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 1>people have drinking games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing a 45,</v>

580
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>so my record player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I would,</v>

581
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.213
<v Speaker 1>when I'd have to flip the 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do a set of pushups and so I </v>

582
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:51.554
<v Speaker 1>played a bunch of 45 last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did a bunch of pushups and by the </v>

583
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:54.824
<v Speaker 1>time I'm done with a 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I'd been caned by a pro in </v>

584
00:24:57.861 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so tired,</v>

585
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I slept dreamless sleep last night.</v>

586
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a dead man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a piece a long time ago that I</v>

587
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:06.824
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed about power lifting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something on the lines of the </v>

588
00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 1>iron never lies.</v>

589
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

590
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

591
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it was great because it was put that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gyms all over.</v>

592
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.503
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you nailed it because it was so </v>

593
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>honest and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so highlighted.</v>

594
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:27.671
<v Speaker 1>What is so beneficial about forcing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to do hard work?</v>

595
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you are going,</v>

596
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

597
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we go and it's a.</v>

598
00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I like to build that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

599
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but here I go muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's more important than any brand</v>

600
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

601
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for me,</v>

602
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the workout is all I go to the gym to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get my head right.</v>

603
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.000
<v Speaker 1>The benefit is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get in good shape.</v>

605
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>But like I just finished a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

606
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I did 27 shows in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just finished a bunch of shows.</v>

607
00:25:56.271 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I did 27 on one day off 27 on two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half hours on stage and night,</v>

608
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 1>no notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking at a high rate of speed.</v>

609
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>The only way I got through that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good diet and three days on,</v>

610
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:08.504
<v Speaker 1>one day off workouts it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the workouts that alleviated the </v>

611
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:15.560
<v Speaker 1>stress that made the sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restorative the muscle tissue,</v>

612
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb it into nutrients,</v>

613
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made the show's good.</v>

614
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workout since I was about 15,</v>

615
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>that's been as much a part of my day as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything just to.</v>

616
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they get kinda mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>clogged.</v>

617
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:31.620
<v Speaker 1>They get depressed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still doing all those,</v>

618
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you still doing power lifting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

619
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

620
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body left the building on that.</v>

621
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Years ago when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Beavis and butthead made fun of one</v>

622
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>of your songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

623
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking great.</v>

624
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It made a seller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sold.</v>

625
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the worst thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

626
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your neck was as big as my waist.</v>

627
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 1>You were huge.</v>

628
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a fatter than my ears </v>
<v Speaker 1>really has to.</v>

629
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 1>There's just those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those muscle groups that just jump up.</v>

630
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do a lot of shrugs all sudden </v>

631
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>death traps are like equal to the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>

632
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Their muscles is this blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those.</v>

633
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 1>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the sternomastoid muscle,</v>

634
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever that big one is on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>

635
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I did seem to hit that muscle</v>

636
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:13.014
<v Speaker 1>group the way I like pull up a dead lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the way you hold a bar during squats </v>

637
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.123
<v Speaker 1>that neck muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always doing something to support a lot </v>

638
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it just got worked and worked and</v>

639
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that's when the Beavis and butthead </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

640
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a big neck.</v>

641
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

642
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but when did you stop doing the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There?</v>

643
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.370
<v Speaker 1>There is or there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 94.</v>

645
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.080
<v Speaker 1>We shot that in the desert and we shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the Mojave desert.</v>

646
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you stop doing the power of </v>

647
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

648
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:41.274
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands just because I felt </v>

649
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 1>a problems in my back and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

650
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 1>for squat day I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 1>belt belting up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wrapping my knees.</v>

652
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like really going for it and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>my frame,</v>

653
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it just can't support my attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my attitude is like I'll lift the</v>

654
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 1>whole damn gym and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reminded,</v>

655
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 1>my body went and then not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more of a swimmer,</v>

656
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 1>runner type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not trying to.</v>

657
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I was lifting a lot for a guy my </v>
<v Speaker 1>size and my,</v>

658
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:10.743
<v Speaker 1>my bone mass and so at one point my back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoulder started hurting and like a </v>

659
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:17.780
<v Speaker 1>different kind of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

660
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you shouldn't be doing this </v>

661
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:19.860
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

662
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the workouts I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can't lift a 10 times,</v>

663
00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just pull the way down so I can.</v>

664
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.930
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 1>treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical,</v>

666
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and a stationary bike and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pullups pushups and uh,</v>

667
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 1>a lot of compound lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench press,</v>

669
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mainly a lot of pull ups,</v>

670
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.650
<v Speaker 1>a trx straps that the guy who invented </v>
<v Speaker 1>them gave them to me as a gift.</v>

671
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.903
<v Speaker 1>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're great because it's just you </v>

672
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not that natural resistance.</v>

673
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I have found that it makes me a bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>limber and I dunno,</v>

674
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to lift everything in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>

675
00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm 56.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

676
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't it,</v>

677
00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.633
<v Speaker 1>all I can do is like blow out that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and never be able to raise my arm </v>

678
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:03.760
<v Speaker 1>over my head again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 1>blew his shoulder out so I don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

680
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you fuck around with Yoga at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

681
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 1>but I admire it because you see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do yoga and there's,</v>

682
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so not only are they flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can tell they're really grounded</v>

683
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're really,</v>

684
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.733
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming on with an energy that I </v>

685
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 1>don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

686
00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 1>it does something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

687
00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the alleviation of tension to increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>range of motion and flexibility.</v>

688
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It also does something to your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

689
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what I noticed in their group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're grueling classes,</v>

690
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>like an hour and a half in a hot yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

691
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.253
<v Speaker 1>It also does something to your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably related to sauna </v>

692
00:29:37.471 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they've shown it.</v>

693
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Sauna treatments and heat shock proteins</v>
<v Speaker 1>do amazing</v>

694
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 2>things to your body to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and,</v>

695
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.533
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just the grueling physical and </v>

696
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 2>mental grind of getting through a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the hot yoga is brutal.</v>

697
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

698
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 2>I've met so many people as you do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

699
00:29:58.961 --> 00:29:59.471
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 2>you think you work out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should come to a yoga class.</v>

701
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 2>You will cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't even make it like they try and</v>

702
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:05.044
<v Speaker 2>challenge me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

703
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I actually got scared of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

704
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:08.764
<v Speaker 2>you want to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't be able to pick up your car </v>

705
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 2>keys at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

706
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you can pick up your car keys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is really brutal.</v>

707
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 2>While you're doing afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel the same way.</v>

708
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 2>You feel like if you lift weights too </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

709
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know that feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well you can't move your body.</v>

710
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't really get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do get just fucking to the point</v>

711
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 2>where you're looking at the clock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize there's 20 minutes to go.</v>

712
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.833
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could get 20 hours a </v>

713
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Head is hot.</v>

714
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>You're your body's pouring water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

715
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Now you can lose five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six pounds in a class easily.</v>

716
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that about those spin classes</v>

717
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:45.220
<v Speaker 2>to people lose too much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to stop and like the less days</v>

718
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:45.791
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

719
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:46.624
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense because you're also on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the momentum of the energy of the room </v>

720
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:50.350
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the instructor is really good,</v>

721
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:52.690
<v Speaker 2>you get hyped up and then start pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little too hard.</v>

722
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in a class like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the biggest people person.</v>

723
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why I started working out when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in high school.</v>

724
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.063
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't throw the ball straight so </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gym was always empty so I just went </v>

725
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never,</v>

726
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been like,</v>

727
00:31:04.991 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>hey class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done that.</v>

728
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good thing about yoga classes,</v>

729
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 2>no one talks so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around those people.</v>

730
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:11.194
<v Speaker 2>There's no interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you kind of feel each other </v>

731
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:14.554
<v Speaker 2>and it's kind of cool because he pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other a little bit without </v>

732
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:16.654
<v Speaker 2>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a big fan of it man and I think </v>

733
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 2>as far as like increasing your longevity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your body,</v>

734
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:24.750
<v Speaker 2>the use of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that it does,</v>

735
00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:25.584
<v Speaker 2>is kind of forge all the connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>between your joints in your body and </v>

736
00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 2>your core and it just makes everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

737
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have as much,</v>

738
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.183
<v Speaker 2>nearly as much back pain as I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more flexible than I have been in </v>

739
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been like a year and a half,</v>

740
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe almost two years I've been really </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

741
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And how many days a week you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do three.</v>

742
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I usually wind up a lot.</v>

743
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually wind up one or two,</v>

744
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 2>but I try for three when I can get three</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do it.</v>

745
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and all the other different</v>

746
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 2>kinds of workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slinky,</v>

747
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.193
<v Speaker 2>really what I like to do is I like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up and decide what I'm going to do </v>

748
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>when I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some days I'm like,</v>

749
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to go kick box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to Jujitsu,</v>

750
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I want to lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to yoga.</v>

751
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.480
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

752
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I just like we were talking about before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast started,</v>

753
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.590
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do with my life at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point I'm almost 50 and 49.</v>

754
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:12.424
<v Speaker 2>I'll be 50 in August is to have as few </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations as possible and as much </v>

755
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:17.674
<v Speaker 2>passion and interest as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of pursue the things that I'm </v>

756
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>really enjoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That keeps you ageless.</v>

757
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.423
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have met so many people by 23 </v>

758
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:26.914
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of retired or then you meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>some 75 year old guy who just run rings </v>

759
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:32.044
<v Speaker 2>around you and it's all in your head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the choices you make and I've seen both </v>

760
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 2>ends of that spectrum or the old guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like younger than you'll ever be and the</v>

761
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>young guy</v>

762
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.903
<v Speaker 1>is just like so pouring into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he turned into his dad or something </v>

763
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:44.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn man,</v>

764
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:45.800

<v Speaker 1>who got to you.</v>

765
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.080
<v Speaker 1>What I take fuel from is like things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your podcast with Ari,</v>

766
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>because I was listening to you talk all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the adventures that you've had and</v>

767
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 1>the travel and the way you go about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got fired up,</v>

768
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to that.</v>

769
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

770
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's telling you to do this.</v>

771
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:06.730
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a fucking cubicle job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

772
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.210

<v Speaker 1>He was deciding to do this.</v>

774
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.753
<v Speaker 1>Realizing the most gratifying thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life consistently as coming up with </v>

775
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 1>where it goes from the cerebral to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

777
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.070
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to write this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

778
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Three years from now I'm still going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be working on this thing,</v>

779
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 1>so long journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here we go,</v>

780
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.763

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get back to this country </v>

781
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:31.544
<v Speaker 1>and come in through that way and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just make these plans and then months </v>

782
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

783
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.953
<v Speaker 1>There you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in Thailand making a </v>

784
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.874
<v Speaker 1>documentary years ago and I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Herald Tribune at breakfast one </v>

785
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:41.954
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Chiang Mai that the following </v>

786
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.760
<v Speaker 1>year is going to be the 25th anniversary</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Bhopal disaster in Bhopal,</v>

787
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 1>India when you need carbide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India Limited,</v>

788
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:49.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the methyl methyl isocyanate tank </v>

789
00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 1>exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killed a bunch of people.</v>

790
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.823
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

791
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be there for the 25th </v>
<v Speaker 1>anniversary.</v>

792
00:33:57.051 --> 00:33:57.884
<v Speaker 1>So I took out an entire year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>researched and I was there for the 25th </v>

793
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 1>anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the march.</v>

794
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I snuck onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

795
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.121
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

796
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:10.121
<v Speaker 1>Union Carbide India Limited site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the exact panel where tank 6:10</v>

797
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 1>blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the switch.</v>

798
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:12.913
<v Speaker 1>I went all the way to where I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of it with the tag on </v>

799
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the thing says mic methyl isocyanate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

800
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the gas.</v>

801
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 1>They hit the water and went and blew up.</v>

802
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.590
<v Speaker 1>They're making bug spray there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went all the way to like,</v>

803
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 1>here is where the guy was flicking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch going.</v>

804
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

805
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 1>The guest scrubbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neutralizers aren't working.</v>

806
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was sneaking around.</v>

807
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.460
<v Speaker 1>There's like armed guards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to shoot you,</v>

808
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:35.294
<v Speaker 1>but they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kick you off and so I just make </v>

809
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 1>these decisions and then ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're booking the tickets,</v>

810
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you're booking the hotel and then one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day you are crawling through the weeds,</v>

<v Speaker 1>motor scooters with your camera,</v>

812
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 1>sneaking in at a buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your shots.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the second one is going to be pretty </v>

<v Speaker 1>that'll be crazy.</v>

832
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to North Korea to where we're </v>

833
00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 1>used to get that visa few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sad he was doing Kim Jong.</v>

834
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Il was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Kim Jong,</v>

835
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Il.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The lit last days of Kim Jong Il before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong wound.</v>

837
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a,</v>

838
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was in Iran,</v>

839
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 1>just like they point you in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to look at.</v>

840
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't look over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a propaganda.</v>

841
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 1>How much time did you spend in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea?</v>

842
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:06.343
<v Speaker 1>About a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Pyongyang and the areas around </v>

843
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.313
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang and then I went there via </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing and then from there up to </v>

844
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Mongolia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then over to Butan was North Korea.</v>

845
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Like just sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

846
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 1>this poor people who are scared of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

847
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tour guides since I went there alone,</v>

848
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>they were very suspicious of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they put two tour spies on me,</v>

849
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 1>the Nice one who talked to me and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean one who does scaled and took notes.</v>

850
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And every day that guy would ask me </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same question.</v>

851
00:36:38.391 --> 00:36:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like when a detective is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>peel the layers of onion skin off.</v>

852
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So you said you're a businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

853
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

854
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.440
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

855
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I edit books,</v>

856
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>which is true mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>

857
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.220
<v Speaker 1>what are the books about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

858
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:53.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often they're not that good.</v>

860
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.523
<v Speaker 1>And so you're all putting one hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a you and the Dutch tourists and the </v>

861
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.173
<v Speaker 1>Australians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's in the one hotel across the </v>

862
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 1>bridge that's with men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rifles.</v>

863
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:07.014
<v Speaker 1>You're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so every day they go on their buses </v>

864
00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and I get in the car and the Australians</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize me,</v>

865
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the Brits recognize me and they all want</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos were walking to the um,</v>

866
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that room is the,</v>

867
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:24.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room where the north and south meet,</v>

868
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they come in through the northern </v>

869
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern doors,</v>

870
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.320
<v Speaker 1>that blue room on the DSJ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

871
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come up with the joint,</v>

872
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the JSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joint security area,</v>

873
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:34.914
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled one of the Australians to the </v>

874
00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:38.014
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

875
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:38.903
<v Speaker 1>can you please call your friends off me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my tour spy is starting to ask </v>

876
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 1>me really weird questions about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want their photo with me.</v>

877
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm caught being in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing books,</v>

878
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.213
<v Speaker 1>rock'n'roll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going downtown for a meeting that I </v>

879
00:37:55.051 --> 00:37:55.884
<v Speaker 1>might not get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he cooled out all his Australian </v>

880
00:37:58.501 --> 00:37:59.334
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this one British guy </v>

881
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.853
<v Speaker 1>who does kept getting in my face with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera because you're all getting taken </v>

882
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>to the same places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll never forget this.</v>

883
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:07.224
<v Speaker 1>My tour guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who for the previous three days was </v>

884
00:38:08.961 --> 00:38:10.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his English was from school,</v>

885
00:38:10.961 --> 00:38:11.794
<v Speaker 1>like how Henry he went from that to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>does this guy know you and all of a </v>

886
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:18.240
<v Speaker 1>sudden his English was as good as mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

887
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not good at lying.</v>

888
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>So I said I met him in the breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

889
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's hot for me.</v>

890
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no explaining it away and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to kind of go,</v>

891
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.374
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had to try and avoid this guy and </v>

892
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I was getting overly nervous.</v>

893
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.093
<v Speaker 1>The last day I was there when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally took me back to the airport in </v>

894
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:36.851
<v Speaker 1>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>am I really getting on this plane?</v>

896
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And when the plane took off man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

897
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that,</v>

898
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 1>but why wouldn't you just say I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>musician.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will let you inform.</v>

<v Speaker 1>claim any of that,</v>

901
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.200

<v Speaker 1>they're not going to let you in.</v>

902
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you in if you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>

903
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

905
00:38:58.691 --> 00:38:59.524
<v Speaker 1>You'll go back to the mainland with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you're wrong because </v>

906
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:02.584

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lead a basketball </v>

919
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So the last is the last time in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

920
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating dinner with this guy and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing wife,</v>

921
00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:42.000
<v Speaker 1>they're both like rocket scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

922
00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:42.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get by with a website that gets </v>

923
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 1>thesis done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his cousin,</v>

924
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 1>her cousin Anousha the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her cousin calls her and says,</v>

925
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.050
<v Speaker 1>your friend Henry's on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

926
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 1>he dropped his fork and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go.</v>

927
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.260
<v Speaker 1>We had to get you to your hotel.</v>

928
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to pack up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just go to the airport,</v>

929
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 1>check in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check your luggage,</v>

930
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.423
<v Speaker 1>find a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your face in it and wait for the </v>

931
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.700
<v Speaker 1>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got to the,</v>

932
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I got to the airport like four hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>early because he said you just,</v>

933
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.863
<v Speaker 1>you got to go low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just sat there in the airport </v>

934
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 1>with my face down and then eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>got on like,</v>

935
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:19.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

936
00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM to Dubai and I was outta there.</v>

937
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.113
<v Speaker 1>What would have happened if you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught questions which leads to more </v>

939
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 1>questions and you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns into like,</v>

940
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 1>well he's been interrogated for the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months and we don't know.</v>

941
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.403
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm not a hot looking girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a president Clinton's not coming to </v>

942
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:39.540
<v Speaker 1>rescue me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

943
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.443
<v Speaker 1>and so those are the two countries I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to where don't tell them what you </v>

944
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:46.570
<v Speaker 1>do with what I was instructed before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

945
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

946
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Because anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:40:49.011 --> 00:40:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you just go and show up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every dude,</v>

948
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 1>do you go to every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these places that you go to,</v>

949
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:57.810
<v Speaker 1>do you pick places where there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>high populations of people?</v>

950
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go to like really nomadic </v>
<v Speaker 1>places?</v>

951
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

952
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.033
<v Speaker 1>I tend to choose places where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just been an election or there's going </v>

953
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 1>to be an election or there just was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>war where there's conflict,</v>

954
00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:11.320
<v Speaker 1>where you see signs of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the wrath of globalization,</v>

955
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 1>the wrath of global climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

956
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 1>places that are politically hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these are of great interest to me</v>

957
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>during the Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

958
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:20.680
<v Speaker 1>don't go to this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

959
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:21.311
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

960
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:22.144
<v Speaker 1>all of them went to every access country</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had and I went to the ones that ms </v>

961
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 1>dot Condoleezza Rice to me not to go to.</v>

962
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I went there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you personally,</v>

963
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

964
00:41:31.831 --> 00:41:32.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

965
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 1>don't go to Bella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosa bellaruse.</v>

966
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

967
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.373
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and I tried to go to all of those </v>

968
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:40.190
<v Speaker 1>places and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

969
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came back in one piece,</v>

970
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:47.390
<v Speaker 1>but in the last few years I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing more eco travel to learn about,</v>

971
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coded bio diversity,</v>

972
00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 1>codependent ecosystems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two years ago,</v>

973
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 1>some are 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

974
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I had time off because I wasn't on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to Easter Island,</v>

975
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>via,</v>

976
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Ecuador for a while on the Napo</v>

977
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 1>River,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a tributary of the Amazon.</v>

978
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And I went on a science boat and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat with scientists,</v>

979
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 1>botanists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird people,</v>

980
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.383
<v Speaker 1>and learned about how the jungle </v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnects and how this parasite </v>

981
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 1>kills that tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which fertilizes that tree.</v>

982
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's really integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

983
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And they're losing their forest because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of timber and oil,</v>

984
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big money and cattle production to a</v>

985
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know about.</v>

986
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.673
<v Speaker 1>But when I was in the interior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about hardwood and oil and </v>

987
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:35.991
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

988
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ro one,</v>

989
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:38.144
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interior tribes are just getting </v>

990
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>discovered and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

991
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:41.984
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their land is getting cleared out and </v>

992
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 1>the government's making a ton of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>off it cannibalizing their own land.</v>

993
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:52.390
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in November of 2015 I was a,</v>

994
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I went to Antarctica and that's the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantive trip I've ever made.</v>

995
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 1>That was the most mind blowing trip I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done where,</v>

996
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:01.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see either you go on deception </v>

997
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:04.514
<v Speaker 1>island and you look down and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits of broken glass from the whale </v>

998
00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:08.024
<v Speaker 1>killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use that island to process and </v>

999
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:13.400
<v Speaker 1>render Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like chips of bone of whale bone</v>

1000
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and all the crap these people left tin </v>
<v Speaker 1>shacks.</v>

1001
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a transmission in the sand </v>

1002
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:20.084
<v Speaker 1>from some vehicle and you see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>unregulated slaughter looks like with </v>

1003
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:23.661
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1004
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make a bunch of money.</v>

1005
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:25.663
<v Speaker 1>Screw the animals will grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they nearly hunted down the seals </v>

1006
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 1>and whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those particular species to extinction.</v>

1007
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1008
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I got on a ship full of scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take lectures every day and you walk</v>

1009
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:37.004
<v Speaker 1>around amongst the Gentoo and the Chin </v>
<v Speaker 1>strap and the Adelie penguins and you </v>

1010
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.850
<v Speaker 1>learn a lot and it's hard to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's almost destructing in front</v>

1011
00:43:46.401 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 1>of you and it's sad and it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like being on the moon.</v>

1012
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:50.954
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to sleep just for </v>

1013
00:43:51.561 --> 00:43:54.230
<v Speaker 1>looking out the window or walking around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some penguin.</v>

1014
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Walking by you is surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hopefully November of this year,</v>

1015
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll have some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to.</v>

1016
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I made friends with the scientists on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship and they said,</v>

1017
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're really into this.</v>

1018
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:07.520
<v Speaker 1>You should come back because we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer trip.</v>

1019
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:08.354
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That starts in the south Georgia and </v>

1020
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:09.620
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

1021
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.131
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1022
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to see if I,</v>

1023
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not working in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have my schedule yet.</v>

1024
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.900
<v Speaker 1>If I'm free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going and you go,</v>

1025
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:18.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go down through Argentina and you </v>

1026
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>leave from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1027
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>So it starts in Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work through Argentina.</v>

1028
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 1>How long will you go down the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

1029
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.000
<v Speaker 1>The one time I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to our point of,</v>

1030
00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's down to [inaudible],</v>

1031
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.183
<v Speaker 1>which is the southern most city in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and that's where you pick up the </v>

1032
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:34.914
<v Speaker 1>ship and you go through the drake </v>
<v Speaker 1>passage and by day four finally you </v>

1033
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 1>start seeing ice and then you look off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1034
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are penguins and there you are.</v>

1035
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 1>But it takes days to get there and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>days to get back.</v>

1036
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's like three days on either end</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's kind of nothing to do,</v>

1037
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:54.570
<v Speaker 1>but take lectures in the lounge about </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and all of that,</v>

1038
00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:57.060
<v Speaker 1>which I did with my notepad out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioned,</v>

1039
00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:57.894
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lecturers afterwards and got a ton </v>

1040
00:44:59.011 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 1>of information.</v>

1041
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I keep in touch with him actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking bizarre and exciting life</v>

1042
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you live now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1043
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 1>knowing I was going to be meeting you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I must say,</v>

1045
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:10.224
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of fans and I wish I had </v>

1047
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:12.414
<v Speaker 1>a dollar for the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people have been writing me </v>

1048
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be on Joe Rogan's podcast and</v>

1049
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:20.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have you done it yet?</v>

1050
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And I missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1051
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.120
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like.</v>

1052
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And I knew who you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like,</v>

1053
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 1>who's this Joe Rogan Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1054
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 1>enough already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1055
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:32.550
<v Speaker 1>people like you and I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that show UFC primetime?</v>

1056
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1057
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I was the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1058
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I did that voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know a lot about sports,</v>

1059
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.760
<v Speaker 1>but I learned a lot about mma just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm these people.</v>

1060
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:44.903
<v Speaker 1>These fighters become relevant to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm saying their names over and </v>

1061
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:48.970
<v Speaker 1>over and I'm watching the footage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.823
<v Speaker 1>I met Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him once for the </v>

1063
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 1>independent film channel or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a participant media.</v>

1064
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1065
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I started being more aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these fighters and all of this stuff.</v>

1066
00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you and I,</v>

1067
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about you the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing I was going to meet you thinking</v>

1068
00:46:07.451 --> 00:46:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like here's this guy with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.750
<v Speaker 1>very interesting life because I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>the standup on,</v>

1070
00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.613
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tv and there he is in the middle of </v>

1071
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.650
<v Speaker 1>the octagon with some guy who just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished knocking the other guy.</v>

1072
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a very eclectic life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got.</v>

1073
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:24.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1074
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:25.494
<v Speaker 1>you are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you didn't grow up anything </v>

1075
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 1>like the rest of your family and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids you went to high school with you,</v>

1076
00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you went to a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1077
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1078
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So when did you decide it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be a realtor on your</v>

1079
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 1>face isn't going to be on the bus bench?</v>

1080
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.213
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had zero work ethic towards anything </v>

1081
00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:46.664
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anything that I did enjoy with I'd </v>

1082
00:46:49.341 --> 00:46:50.174
<v Speaker 3>become obsessed with just it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupy all my thoughts and I couldn't </v>

1083
00:46:53.691 --> 00:46:57.920
<v Speaker 3>wait to do it 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I got out of high school,</v>

1084
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:59.263
<v Speaker 3>I took a year off before I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college and the only reason why I went </v>

1085
00:47:02.181 --> 00:47:04.610
<v Speaker 3>to college was because I didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to think when I was a loser,</v>

1086
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:07.010
<v Speaker 3>I was tired of people telling people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I wasn't doing anything.</v>

1087
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:09.200
<v Speaker 3>So I went to college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to boston,</v>

1088
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.620
<v Speaker 3>umass boston for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why I went was because I</v>

1089
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:13.970
<v Speaker 3>didn't want people thinking I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>loser.</v>

1090
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.750
<v Speaker 3>And I knew that I could not exist in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular job.</v>

1091
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have it whenever it was.</v>

1092
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing,</v>

1093
00:47:20.931 --> 00:47:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you don't have it,</v>

1094
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.470
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1095
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:26.360
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have a straight life.</v>

1096
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

1097
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was radioactive.</v>

1098
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I would take</v>

1099
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 3>construction jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like I was being poisoned,</v>

1100
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1101
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.460
<v Speaker 3>it was literally like I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready.</v>

1102
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1103
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you're young and you're awake and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1104
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is killing me.</v>

1105
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a life of those jobs.</v>

1106
00:47:42.591 --> 00:47:43.424
<v Speaker 1>So I went out of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went one semester at american </v>

1107
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 1>university in Washington dc trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if I liked college.</v>

1108
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I liked learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't like,</v>

1109
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:50.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated school so another four years on </v>

1110
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Speaker 1>a student loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one semester.</v>

1111
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>It took me so many years to earn my way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that debt.</v>

1112
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I just kinda went into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working world going at this is,</v>

1113
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is gonna hurt.</v>

1114
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.223
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be swollen feet and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>top ramen noodles and no sleep and my </v>

1115
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 1>crap apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is my life.</v>

1116
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.403
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like someone was strangling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me because I just knew I didn't know </v>

1117
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 1>where I was going to go or what I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing,</v>

1118
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.590
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that this wasn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThIs was going to kill me.</v>

1119
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.530
<v Speaker 1>My thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of</v>

1120
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.660
<v Speaker 3>well out there like that and for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful reason they never find whatever it</v>

1121
00:48:27.121 --> 00:48:27.954
<v Speaker 3>is that can break them free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never catch a ride on that river </v>

1122
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.570
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1123
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.000
<v Speaker 3>and I got lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found standup comedy and uh,</v>

1124
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.893
<v Speaker 3>I had heard already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I love how a lot of it had come </v>

1125
00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:42.810
<v Speaker 3>from martial arts too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd fought A lot and I competed a lot in</v>

1126
00:48:42.811 --> 00:48:43.644
<v Speaker 3>martial arts tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that from that I realized </v>

1127
00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:46.914
<v Speaker 3>that like these unconventional paths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they brought me something that I wasn't </v>

1128
00:48:50.431 --> 00:48:53.670
<v Speaker 3>getting from regular life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get brought me self esteem.</v>

1129
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.140
<v Speaker 3>It gave me this feeling that it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1130
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.080
<v Speaker 3>it was the only thing that I'd ever done</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole life where I've said,</v>

1131
00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm not a loser,</v>

1132
00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:02.100
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of thought I was an outcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a loser.</v>

1133
00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:03.143
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful at something only because I </v>

1134
00:49:04.561 --> 00:49:05.394
<v Speaker 3>was obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I knew there was no way I was </v>

1135
00:49:08.761 --> 00:49:10.440
<v Speaker 3>ever going to be able to hold a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1136
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:12.990
<v Speaker 3>And then I got lucky when I was 21 and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>found standup.</v>

1137
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:14.303
<v Speaker 3>And so from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd kind of like locked into this thing </v>

1138
00:49:16.741 --> 00:49:17.574
<v Speaker 3>where I'm just going to do what I like </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fuck what everybody says because </v>

1139
00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 3>everybody's given me advice to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and advice,</v>

1140
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:23.284
<v Speaker 3>do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it never seems to be what I want to </v>

1141
00:49:25.531 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1142
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And their advice is coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different world,</v>

1143
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they mean well,</v>

1144
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.443
<v Speaker 1>but they're coming from the whole other </v>
<v Speaker 1>value system at a whole other </v>

1145
00:49:33.961 --> 00:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>expectation of their own lives and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life should be in all of that.</v>

1146
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And all of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not poisoned,</v>

1147
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but it says kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1148
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.533
<v Speaker 1>a naphtha to every breath you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is ultimately useless because </v>

1149
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.450
<v Speaker 1>they're always going to tote that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they've got.</v>

1150
00:49:48.451 --> 00:49:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say,</v>

1151
00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:51.360
<v Speaker 1>here's how I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1152
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:52.463
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at them in that job </v>

1153
00:49:54.031 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1154
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:55.683
<v Speaker 1>you're the crazy wasn't amongst us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't handle wearing that </v>

1155
00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 1>tie everyday and taking it from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1156
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.270
<v Speaker 3>And some people are just like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate world.</v>

1158
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.133
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky and I found a bunch of shit </v>

1159
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:08.300
<v Speaker 3>that I like and if you had said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1160
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.890
<v Speaker 3>if you asked me if I was outside of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1161
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:11.943
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't know that I existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said you think it's possible to </v>

1162
00:50:14.191 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 3>be a cage fighting commentator slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup comedian,</v>

1163
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1164
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.653
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't go together when you travel </v>

1165
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.040
<v Speaker 1>and they say they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1166
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.120
<v Speaker 1>they say occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>

1167
00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1168
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>What do I do if</v>

1169
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going somewhere for the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always write ufc commentator.</v>

1170
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:32.744
<v Speaker 2>OkAy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The easiest one to do because then they </v>

1171
00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:34.131
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1172
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they let me in and it's easy,</v>

1173
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:37.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting your passport stamped,</v>

1174
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.200
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time I write comic stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up comedIan.</v>

1175
00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one thing that I definitely </v>

1177
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:45.884
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that everything else I could kind </v>

1178
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 2>of quit and even that I could kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>

1179
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of quit everything.</v>

1180
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

1181
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a good idea to clear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decks citizen of the world.</v>

1182
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professIonal citizen of the world.</v>

1183
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I think if there's a bravery </v>

1184
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.420
<v Speaker 1>that one takes when one embraces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight world that I simply don't have.</v>

1185
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a level of guts where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1186
00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like this job,</v>

1187
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:12.914
<v Speaker 1>but I love my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the rIght thing and I </v>

1188
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>don't have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really.</v>

1189
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm not tethered to that value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire it and if I was a dad I'd be </v>

1190
00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:20.924
<v Speaker 1>standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there a kind of guts where you just </v>

1191
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 1>get on that bus every day like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn man,</v>

1192
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this job and you grimly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold onto your sack lunch and you just </v>

1193
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:32.780
<v Speaker 1>go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like my mom and my dad,</v>

1194
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:33.883
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were very hardworking people </v>

1195
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure how much they ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>really loved their jobs.</v>

1196
00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't wait to go to the office.</v>

1197
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>They just kind of what I'm an adult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

1198
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:45.524
<v Speaker 1>And they just kinda put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put themselves through that grinder and </v>

1199
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.450
<v Speaker 1>turn the handle themselves and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

1200
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.493
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is kinda grimly set their jaw and </v>

1201
00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an adult,</v>

1202
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.063
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go out into it and you look at </v>

1203
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 1>a guy like iggy pop who could never have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a straight job.</v>

1204
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It would just be the thing would fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>over because he's an artIst too.</v>

1205
00:52:07.171 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Speaker 1>He's the real thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's innovation,</v>

1206
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's an intolerance and it's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1207
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>just a lack of courage to tow that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1208
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have it.</v>

1209
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the stamina to go into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>building every day for 28 years.</v>

1210
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Like my dad went to one building for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life was one c,</v>

1211
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.540
<v Speaker 1>one corporation he worked for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he stopped.</v>

1212
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's alive or dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was that guy in that building </v>

1213
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 1>every damn day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hours and hours.</v>

1214
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.710
<v Speaker 2>There is a dance that when you discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1215
00:52:38.711 --> 00:52:42.880
<v Speaker 2>like you don't want to disparage anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had genuinely has shown courage and</v>

1216
00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:45.100
<v Speaker 2>grinding it out because for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>families does</v>

1217
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 1>take courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have it.</v>

1218
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I consider them people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world and in my life,</v>

1219
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I really live in the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that much.</v>

1220
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I live in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented henry world.</v>

1221
00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1222
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw this video with lady gaga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about our music,</v>

1223
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but she did this long intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the $80 million dollar thing.</v>

1224
00:53:06.201 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 1>And she said she feels like reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate reality.</v>

1225
00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1226
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I just can't handle a lot of it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't shy away from it.</v>

1227
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I go into situations that are hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

1228
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:22.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm that kind of flatline existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of we adults engage in.</v>

1229
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I think that would have destroyed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've found alcohol or something </v>

1230
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:30.060
<v Speaker 1>really destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:33.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a droning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonating existences.</v>

1232
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.313
<v Speaker 4>Bob,</v>

1233
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:36.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people go,</v>

1234
00:53:36.371 --> 00:53:37.204
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck it up and you'll get get in there </v>

1235
00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Share up and it's not that bad.</v>

1236
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

1237
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1238
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.300
<v Speaker 1>some people can get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1239
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.420
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have a different mind.</v>

1240
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.910
<v Speaker 1>But if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a friend that was doing that,</v>

1241
00:53:54.911 --> 00:53:55.744
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that friend really wanted to be a </v>

1242
00:53:56.651 --> 00:53:57.484
<v Speaker 1>novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you just fucking go to try to poke </v>

1243
00:54:02.411 --> 00:54:05.890
<v Speaker 1>in your spare time but get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is you've said that to him</v>

1244
00:54:05.891 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 1>or her before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1245
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.130
<v Speaker 1>And like these people write me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1246
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.050
<v Speaker 1>my band is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I,</v>

1247
00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:11.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm two years into college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I quit college and take my band </v>

1248
00:54:14.501 --> 00:54:15.334
<v Speaker 1>on the road?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is if that person really </v>

1249
00:54:19.241 --> 00:54:21.190
<v Speaker 1>had the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be writing me.</v>

1250
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:23.380
<v Speaker 1>They would just be telling me when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were playing.</v>

1251
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never asked for advice.</v>

1252
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:26.443
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said either I'm going to play </v>

1253
00:54:28.451 --> 00:54:29.284
<v Speaker 1>this music or I'm going to die tryIng.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never occurred to me that there's </v>

1254
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.150
<v Speaker 1>asked advice about what and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had any fear.</v>

1255
00:54:37.151 --> 00:54:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I ran at it and I didn't care if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a wall there or the cops I just ran.</v>

1256
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.410
<v Speaker 1>But surely you must have had heroes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it also before you.</v>

1257
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So you felt like death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1258
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.341
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not definitely.</v>

1259
00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Not like you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of rock stars,</v>

1260
00:54:51.101 --> 00:54:52.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of musicians,</v>

1261
00:54:52.571 --> 00:54:54.610
<v Speaker 1>a lot of artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pursued their goals.</v>

1262
00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:57.130
<v Speaker 1>They went out and chase things and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew that it was a path.</v>

1263
00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.310
<v Speaker 1>The ones I had met before I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>music full time.</v>

1264
00:55:00.311 --> 00:55:01.150
<v Speaker 1>We're all broke.</v>

1265
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I met some punk rock bands like </v>
<v Speaker 1>from england,</v>

1266
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whoever and you're like,</v>

1267
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're broke Too.</v>

1268
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And they're just crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I identified with that,</v>

1269
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1270
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.370
<v Speaker 1>if you eVer been done a show where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet that,</v>

1271
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that actor who has had like 80 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting class and all,</v>

1272
00:55:23.771 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 1>they talk about their acting coach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1273
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.333
<v Speaker 1>after I get off the set today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back to my class and </v>

1274
00:55:28.901 --> 00:55:31.030
<v Speaker 1>like all they do is take classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1275
00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.010
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're all you're going to do is ever</v>

1276
00:55:33.011 --> 00:55:34.450
<v Speaker 1>take classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to.</v>

1277
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:35.703
<v Speaker 1>The rubber's never going to hit the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're always in the on pause </v>

1278
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:40.690
<v Speaker 1>with the acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some days you just gotta go like,</v>

1279
00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like that's me.</v>

1280
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1281
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's really going to hurt.</v>

1282
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>

1283
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Like with music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never like,</v>

1284
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to make it make what?</v>

1285
00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to do a good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I would ever make money </v>

1286
00:55:54.461 --> 00:55:55.294
<v Speaker 1>doing music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I'd ever be able to pay </v>

1287
00:55:56.531 --> 00:55:57.364
<v Speaker 1>my rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just reconciled my life to a life of </v>

1288
00:55:59.051 --> 00:56:04.051
<v Speaker 1>fighting bad tasting food and sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the drummer,</v>

1289
00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:06.910
<v Speaker 1>snored all night in the back of the van </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping the bass,</v>

1290
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.400
<v Speaker 1>the bass player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guitar player didn't drive this into</v>

1291
00:56:09.401 --> 00:56:11.770
<v Speaker 1>a tree because we didn't have a driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

1292
00:56:11.771 --> 00:56:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It's independent music and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawl through these tours that makes you</v>

1293
00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:15.904
<v Speaker 1>pretty tough like a junk yard dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I never thought it would ever </v>

1294
00:56:18.701 --> 00:56:19.534
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured this is your life and </v>

1295
00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:21.580
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1296
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the guy hits you with something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>die in the hospital.</v>

1297
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I just was not a fatalist but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

1298
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And I never saw past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the eighties,</v>

1299
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the band got bigger or whatever.</v>

1300
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1301
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I've always run it things going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1302
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:38.824
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it or die or I never thought </v>

1303
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 1>there was any wiggle room or any cushion</v>
<v Speaker 1>or much alternative.</v>

1304
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that resourceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kind of,</v>

1305
00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy enough to run at it.</v>

1306
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And by running a really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten through it,</v>

1307
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because I'm smart or good </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>

1308
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just because as richard gere once </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1309
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:57.934
<v Speaker 1>I've got nowhere else to go and that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helped me where I'm going to get </v>

1310
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 1>through this tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got nothing else going on.</v>

1311
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll stay in this band because I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere else to go.</v>

1312
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:06.364
<v Speaker 1>But being this incredibly hard to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>band and that's been very helpful to me </v>

1313
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:12.280
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This really hurts.</v>

1314
00:57:12.281 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Well that's better than the painted </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there with the apron behind the</v>

1315
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a different kind of pain.</v>

1316
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've managed to transcend that,</v>

1317
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.633
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>

1318
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:22.643
<v Speaker 3>managed to find this very unique path in</v>
<v Speaker 3>life where you're doing all these </v>

1319
00:57:26.641 --> 00:57:29.490
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not no longer in a band anymore.</v>

1320
00:57:29.491 --> 00:57:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And now you're this worLdwide travelers </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash performance artists.</v>

1321
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Were you doing these spoken word things </v>
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>

1322
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.303
<v Speaker 3>They're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like stand up and I had a </v>

1323
00:57:38.941 --> 00:57:39.960
<v Speaker 3>lot of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I had a bought a couple of your cds way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>

1325
00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:45.150
<v Speaker 3>It was like in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1326
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 3>cause I thought it was music and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that you were.</v>

1327
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:50.730
<v Speaker 3>And then as a spoken word like what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck is this?</v>

1328
00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:51.980
<v Speaker 3>And I listed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1329
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.400
<v Speaker 3>it's this kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>

1330
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.560
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a freer form.</v>

1331
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More anecdotal.</v>

1332
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1333
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 1>did you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

1334
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 1>when did you start doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That many,</v>

1335
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:02.164
<v Speaker 1>many years ago in 1983 a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a local promoter in hollywood </v>

1336
00:58:05.831 --> 00:58:06.664
<v Speaker 1>and he would take like 20 people it give</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone five minutes and it'd be the </v>

1337
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 1>singer and the gun club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy from the minute man,</v>

1338
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 1>the guy from this band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl from that event.</v>

1339
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And I would go to these shows because </v>
<v Speaker 1>even when was bad it was great.</v>

1340
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's cheering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
00:58:17.381 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 1>all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it sucked,</v>

1342
00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1343
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.823
<v Speaker 1>you to applaud even harder black flags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bass player would be on these gigs and </v>

1344
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:25.174
<v Speaker 1>he'd go up and read from his notebook is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an amazing intellect and I would always </v>

1345
00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 1>go hang out with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1346
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and one night the promoter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a big mouth.</v>

1347
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's get you up there next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

1348
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:34.440

1350
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 bucks or whatever it was.</v>

1352
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that money and the next week I</v>

1353
00:58:41.171 --> 00:58:42.004
<v Speaker 1>got up there and I read something that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had written and told a story about what </v>

1354
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:45.124
<v Speaker 1>had happened at band practice the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before when the white supremist try to </v>

1355
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:51.690
<v Speaker 1>run over our guitar player with his car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the audit is like,</v>

1356
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.840

<v Speaker 1>and so I walked off stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big applause,</v>

1360
00:58:58.031 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and everyone came up to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's your next show?</v>

1361
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:00.911
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1362
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they meant the band.</v>

1363
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 1>They went under this the next year where</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1366
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.690
<v Speaker 1>And the promoter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really good at that.</v>

00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:28.844
<v Speaker 1>it spoken word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought there's a way to </v>

1372
00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:31.710
<v Speaker 1>starvation was I don't want to go see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gig,</v>

1373
00:59:31.711 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>this spoken word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snore fest,</v>

1374
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:35.750
<v Speaker 1>so I've always just called it a talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1375
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.913
<v Speaker 1>So I would read things and anecdote </v>
<v Speaker 1>between pages and then one day I just </v>

1376
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:41.534
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped bringing the things to read on </v>

1377
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:43.910
<v Speaker 1>stage and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1378
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:44.743
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>holland and the thing and I just tell </v>

1379
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the late eighties I was doing the</v>

1380
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 1>entire continent of europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scandinavia,</v>

1381
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>

1382
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and then it went on and on with the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour is 19 countries and 165 shows.</v>

1383
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:03.643
<v Speaker 1>That's why I came back from last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it traveled at comedies like </v>

1384
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>me and a microphone and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1385
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:09.703
<v Speaker 1>it's more general admission theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every once in a while I'll do like </v>

1386
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>the melbourne comedy festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sydney comedy festival,</v>

1387
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.293
<v Speaker 1>or like three nights of comedy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing an hour on one of those </v>

1388
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a comedy club on this last tour.</v>

1389
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:22.724
<v Speaker 1>There was a night off or doing a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the last bucket or one of those </v>

1390
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1391
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>with the pa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pa is like bolted into the wall.</v>

1392
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one light.</v>

1393
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my big tour bus out front,</v>

1394
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like right next to the strip bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went in there and went,</v>

1395
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.233
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those little eight by 10 frame </v>

1396
01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:40.214
<v Speaker 1>photos on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go into places like this right </v>

1397
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>below me.</v>

1398
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just not my world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sold the place out.</v>

1399
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>The audience couldn't have been nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the owner thanked me and I said,</v>

1400
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:49.544
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm ever back in this part of </v>

1401
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this venue again.</v>

1402
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be here.</v>

1403
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.353
<v Speaker 1>And it was a really good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what I do kind of lends </v>

1404
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:00.104
<v Speaker 1>itself to comedy in that life plus time </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's funny and comedy </v>

1405
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>don't try and I don't write material </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1406
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but when you try things that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just basically report on that which is</v>

1407
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:18.041
<v Speaker 1>funny and many things occur to me either</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately or eventually to be funny,</v>

1408
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.013
<v Speaker 1>like almost anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then obviously some things are never </v>

1409
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>going to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most things are like,</v>

1410
01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which way your politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>lean that much,</v>

1411
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>but you can look at the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration go like eat,</v>

1412
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.130
<v Speaker 1>we're all going down the drain.</v>

1413
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.821
<v Speaker 1>Or you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1414
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:35.654
<v Speaker 1>this is the lowest hanging fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This students has jumped up on a table </v>

1415
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>onto the silver platter with his ass in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and an apple already.</v>

1416
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>His mouth like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be great.</v>

1417
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Like he's serving himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's jumped into my lap.</v>

1418
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's different ways of looking</v>

1419
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:50.954
<v Speaker 1>at all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess comedians just look at </v>

1420
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met many of them.</v>

1421
01:01:56.031 --> 01:01:56.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of comedy or at least </v>

1422
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>humorous moments that inform what I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage,</v>

1423
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>which allows me to go for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage because they had no humor in it.</v>

1424
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:07.244
<v Speaker 1>It would be stultifying boring for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the audience and a lot of ways </v>

1425
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>when an administration has really fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1426
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>comics do take joy in it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know like,</v>

1427
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>like when the book during the bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

1428
01:02:17.431 --> 01:02:22.431
<v Speaker 1>like there was eight years of gold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is that times five or 10,</v>

1429
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:23.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1430
01:02:23.151 --> 01:02:23.984
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also when you find that gold </v>

1431
01:02:27.821 --> 01:02:28.654
<v Speaker 1>mine of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also equates on the other end to a </v>

1432
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>disastrous time for the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets scary.</v>

1433
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Environmentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting scary.</v>

1434
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:38.963
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a proposal now to get rid of </v>

1435
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:41.034
<v Speaker 1>public lands and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make public lands private and start </v>

1436
01:02:44.071 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>tapping into them and sucking out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and ruin all these places that</v>

1437
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>people go and hunt and fish and hike and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

1438
01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1439
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:52.803
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call the comments in this </v>

1440
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:56.664
<v Speaker 1>country where you can go to the park and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever spent time in </v>

1441
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>parks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a decency that you'll often find</v>

1442
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.813
<v Speaker 1>where the family picks up the garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll even see the little kid </v>

1443
01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:10.050
<v Speaker 1>picking up the cup because it's our park</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not mr kubiak necessarily,</v>

1444
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>but I love that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't screw this up man.</v>

1445
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It's yours and mine and while we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1446
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.613
<v Speaker 1>let's cut the crap and be really cool to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and really appreciate these </v>

1447
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

1448
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So I grew up in Washington dc and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been there.</v>

1449
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped into a park.</v>

1450
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.053
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into a deciduous tree and he's </v>

1451
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>rock creek park with the white house </v>
<v Speaker 1>near it.</v>

1452
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:32.743
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just park park park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I grew up every day I'm outside </v>

1453
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.473
<v Speaker 1>looking at bats and finding toads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like outside of my apartment is a park </v>

1454
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.053
<v Speaker 1>and I was outside all the time and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really came to love that ethic of this </v>

1455
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:46.104
<v Speaker 1>is ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're on the subways and in </v>

1456
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Russia there's no garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1457
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>they really take pride in their soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their beautiful and it's our subway</v>

1458
01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>don't litter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1459
01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:55.183
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a rectitude and a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>decency that we americans skew towards </v>

1460
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>when we're in these places that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all somewhat responsible for.</v>

1461
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And to take that away.</v>

1462
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.170
<v Speaker 1>When everything becomes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

1463
01:04:07.171 --> 01:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I drew the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you step over to kill you,</v>

1464
01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:11.430
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bring out the best in us.</v>

1465
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think those public lands are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really part of what keeps us from,</v>

1466
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going crazy and to see them the,</v>

1467
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1468
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:22.764
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people like trump who look at </v>

1469
01:04:24.241 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 1>central park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1470
01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>what a waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a waste.</v>

1471
01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.873
<v Speaker 1>The it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can put nine hotels for casinos in a </v>

1472
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 1>theme park in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1473
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.323
<v Speaker 1>teddy roosevelt and a lot of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that established the national park </v>

1474
01:04:36.421 --> 01:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>system in this country many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>

1475
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:39.443
<v Speaker 1>they had an incredible vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realized that we have this amazing </v>

1476
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:43.164
<v Speaker 1>landscape and they decided to preserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and put it in the trust of the </v>

1477
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:47.754
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it a public thing where anyone can </v>

1478
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can go and hike,</v>

1479
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>anyone can go and and some beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1480
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Amazing and it doesn't exist anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1481
01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:56.423
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really rare resource that we have here </v>

1482
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:01.020
<v Speaker 1>in America and right now during this </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

1483
01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:02.600
<v Speaker 1>we're in danger of losing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1484
01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.890
<v Speaker 1>it's very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1485
01:05:03.891 --> 01:05:04.724
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1486
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:05.963
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to get up every day with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate list of people and I don't think </v>

1487
01:05:09.241 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump wakes up every day going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I screw up a bunch of people?</v>

1488
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.253
<v Speaker 1>I reallY don't think that's on his menu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think he's a businessman who's </v>

1489
01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>looking to make deals that the tell for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me was when the president said,</v>

1490
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>if vladimir putin agrees to help us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight against isis,</v>

1491
01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll consider lifting those sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nOt,</v>

1492
01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make a deal.</v>

1493
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this,</v>

1494
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll get that here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets that.</v>

1495
01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a deal maker.</v>

1496
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not really a deal in global </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs necessarily all the time.</v>

1497
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.083
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not with that guy on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular issue and I think he's kind </v>

1498
01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:49.621
<v Speaker 1>of tone deaf to some of the more nuanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that it takes to be America in an</v>

1499
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.573
<v Speaker 1>ever more interconnected world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>evermore diminishing resources and to </v>

1500
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:03.631
<v Speaker 1>start privatizing a America chopping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parks and all that.</v>

1501
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.660
<v Speaker 1>It's real sad if that happens is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy,</v>

1502
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to go into a place like I can</v>

1503
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:11.074
<v Speaker 1>walk in here or even though I grew up as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shy kid who didn't play well with </v>

1504
01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:15.694
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would go to the library all the </v>

1505
01:06:16.871 --> 01:06:17.704
<v Speaker 1>time that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that library card and I can take this </v>

1506
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:20.441
<v Speaker 1>book home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1507
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:21.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to take care of it.</v>

1508
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read the book and take it back.</v>

1509
01:06:23.831 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 1>All thoSe alfred hitchcock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1510
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 1>stories for kids or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read all that stuff and the library is</v>

1511
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 1>a big deal for me because I felt like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

1512
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I have my card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can walk into this massive,</v>

1513
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>interesting smelling cool building and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mine.</v>

1514
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.453
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe the freedom I had in </v>

1515
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:43.840
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ancient seats in the place smelled</v>

1516
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>of books and it was mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got my head.</v>

1517
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.873
<v Speaker 1>It was never not amazing to me to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the library and like any damn book </v>

1518
01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can walk into any section and no one's</v>

1519
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:54.761
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey kid,</v>

1520
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1521
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.733
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get in a park and you </v>

1522
01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>know when you're in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that.</v>

1523
01:07:00.821 --> 01:07:01.301
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1524
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>it's our sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our subway.</v>

1525
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Be cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a.</v>

1526
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 1>There's an inherit a lot of people fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>

1527
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:07.684
<v Speaker 1>If they never spent time there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an inherent decency amongst new </v>

1528
01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>yorkers because you are so smashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1529
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make human contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1530
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You're going to bump into someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is,</v>

1531
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 1>so you better bring some humor and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of like,</v>

1532
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay and I see that in new yorkers,</v>

1533
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.983
<v Speaker 1>just really great greatness and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make us cheap and petty and we </v>

1534
01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.473
<v Speaker 1>turned into some twilight zone episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what I fear in this country is </v>

1535
01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:36.004
<v Speaker 1>us kind of cheating ourselves out of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>great we are when you don't scare the </v>

1536
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>crap out of us all the time.</v>

1537
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1538
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean trump has just such a polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure.</v>

1539
01:07:44.831 --> 01:07:45.664
<v Speaker 3>I hope that it unites us in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways so we realize how good we have it </v>

1540
01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:50.794
<v Speaker 3>and we realize what really is important </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that having this guy who so many </v>

1541
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:55.444
<v Speaker 3>people were opposed to and having these </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies at so many people are opposed </v>

1542
01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.193
<v Speaker 3>to even if you're not opposed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that supported </v>

1543
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:03.850
<v Speaker 3>him that now looking at some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies,</v>

1544
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.460
<v Speaker 3>particularly the public land policy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of freaking out.</v>

1545
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:07.953
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that is gonna unite </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks and it's gonna make people </v>

1546
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:14.090
<v Speaker 3>understand what is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that gigantic women's march here.</v>

1547
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 3>That was impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly impressive.</v>

1548
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who saw that coming out of nowhere.</v>

1549
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:19.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one statement that he makes goofing </v>

1550
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:22.770
<v Speaker 3>around with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1551
01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:27.770
<v Speaker 3>a guy that Billy Bush character on a bus</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially led to that movement.</v>

1552
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:28.934
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why else would it be a only a woman's </v>

1553
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:32.504
<v Speaker 3>march when he gets an office?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It Was because he's got this perceived </v>

1554
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 3>attitude about women and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejection of that.</v>

1555
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1556
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he's getting used to being on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the global stage where,</v>

1557
01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:43.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hIccup,</v>

1558
01:08:43.111 --> 01:08:48.111
<v Speaker 1>every cough shifts the world's markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think other presidents have rocked</v>

1559
01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:50.844
<v Speaker 1>that responsibility far more gracefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even presidents I don't necessarily </v>

1560
01:08:54.271 --> 01:08:55.104
<v Speaker 1>agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really understood the awesome </v>

1561
01:08:57.241 --> 01:08:58.074
<v Speaker 1>weight of that job and they really kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of feared it and tried their best even </v>

1562
01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>presence I whose policies I disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1563
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I think they really got the magnitude.</v>

1564
01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:09.700
<v Speaker 3>When you think about your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have this wander last and this</v>

1565
01:09:09.701 --> 01:09:10.534
<v Speaker 3>passion for exploring new environments </v>
<v Speaker 3>and learning about new cultures and you </v>

1566
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:14.564
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were also talking about just </v>

1567
01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.653
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking great poll of death because </v>

1568
01:09:19.901 --> 01:09:20.734
<v Speaker 3>it is there and it's always to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered when you're looking at a guy </v>

1569
01:09:22.601 --> 01:09:26.350
<v Speaker 3>like that who was older than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 70 something years old,</v>

1570
01:09:26.351 --> 01:09:30.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that fucking life is a meat grinder.</v>

1571
01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.950
<v Speaker 3>That job is the greatest aging job </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever seen.</v>

1572
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.110
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen people go in and they see the</v>

1573
01:09:38.111 --> 01:09:41.450
<v Speaker 3>beat barack obama before and after </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures know it.</v>

1574
01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.080
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is going to happen to trump?</v>

1575
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:48.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a fucking old man already </v>
<v Speaker 3>with bad die and why?</v>

1576
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Like what is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have $4,000,000,000</v>

1577
01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.073
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck he has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have your name on all these </v>

1578
01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:55.894
<v Speaker 3>buildings all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the motivation to continue </v>

1579
01:09:58.761 --> 01:09:58.930
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1580
01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:59.763
<v Speaker 1>That that's what I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered with the koch </v>

1581
01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:04.020
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the two angriest man in America and</v>

1582
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>in the obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny of obama,</v>

1583
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd always opine about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1584
01:10:07.891 --> 01:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>you got $34,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have me killed right now and all</v>

1585
01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:16.020
<v Speaker 1>the pizza you want and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so angry again?</v>

1586
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1587
01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the tyranny in your life?</v>

1588
01:10:18.721 --> 01:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>thIrty 4 billion a shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think with some people,</v>

1589
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I did a movie many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first ones I was ever in with</v>

1590
01:10:26.671 --> 01:10:30.840
<v Speaker 1>a very big movie star and someone told </v>
<v Speaker 1>me how much he makes in a year.</v>

1591
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wow,</v>

1592
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>and why does he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>

1593
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.831
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1594
01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>all his friends have 100 million and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to catch up.</v>

1595
01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.203
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the first 50 and it's like </v>

1596
01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>going out in the rain while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>soaking wet,</v>

1597
01:10:45.601 --> 01:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>going out.</v>

1598
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's raining like pal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your warranty wet.</v>

1599
01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do with the other 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion?</v>

1600
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1601
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:53.243
<v Speaker 1>And I think with some people it's maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from some knowing insecurity and </v>

1602
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.320
<v Speaker 1>nothing's ever big enough like you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been around famous people.</v>

1603
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I've met a number of big actors or big </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock stars and the big,</v>

1604
01:11:07.261 --> 01:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the rock star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just my experience,</v>

1605
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:10.853
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the rock star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more humble and cool are the more </v>

1606
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.073
<v Speaker 1>they love music and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're humble in front of it and they </v>

1607
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>ask what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1608
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and I've met some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been lucky,</v>

1609
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of my rock heroes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1610
01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>just really hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I met george carlin once,</v>

1611
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.433
<v Speaker 1>I just on the beacon theater and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to go do one of hIs hbo specials </v>

1612
01:11:30.831 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1613
01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did people get the jokes?</v>

1614
01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1615
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 1>So people understand you when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage,</v>

1616
01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it'll be okay?</v>

1617
01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.173
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking me if your show will be </v>

1618
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your church fricken carla and man,</v>

1619
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>

1620
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>And to see that kind of not insecurity </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that kind of like,</v>

1621
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it go okay?</v>

1622
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Because I got to go there next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yikes.</v>

1623
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Like george carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk on water,</v>

1624
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.013
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that he was still wanting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be okay that he didn't think I've </v>

1625
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.670
<v Speaker 1>got this on george carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1626
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still open.</v>

1627
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:07.020
<v Speaker 1>He still look knowing that it could go </v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

1628
01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:07.854
<v Speaker 1>You might have a stinking night while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cameras are on and he's still fears </v>

1629
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:13.290
<v Speaker 1>having a bad show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means so much to him.</v>

1630
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you're in that mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can greet the day better.</v>

1631
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1632
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:21.234
<v Speaker 1>I don't have as much as he has or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy made a nasty tweet about me and I'm </v>

1633
01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 1>going to get on twitter and answer back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>

1634
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>

1635
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>The point I'm making is nothing satiates</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thirst,</v>

1636
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.753
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the top executive slot and he's </v>

1637
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>still probably grumbling about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just wanting to win.</v>

1638
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that he's got it,</v>

1639
01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he did his acceptance speech,</v>

1640
01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I was in Washington on the night of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election onstage at the lincoln theater.</v>

1641
01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.123
<v Speaker 1>I watched the whole damn thing until </v>
<v Speaker 1>five in the morning when he made his </v>

1642
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>acceptance speech and the look on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face on the,</v>

1643
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.153
<v Speaker 1>on mr trump's face was a wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just saw off a big chunk of meat </v>

1644
01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 1>for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

1645
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1646
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.610
<v Speaker 1>now I got to go to all those meetIngs.</v>

1647
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a big dog I just bought.</v>

1648
01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

1649
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big deal.</v>

1650
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the ways he's,</v>

1651
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.890
<v Speaker 1>he'll escape the stress of it is I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll put it off on other people.</v>

1652
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 1>He'll delegate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike pence will be,</v>

1653
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:19.674
<v Speaker 1>it'll be president pence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy just looking good for the </v>

1654
01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:24.144
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's how he'll get </v>

1655
01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:26.574
<v Speaker 1>through it because it destroyed bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years of the presidency took bush </v>

1656
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>was a very handsome man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he walked into office,</v>

1657
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>he came out of there destroyed and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was far younger.</v>

1658
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:34.494
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old was bush when he was in his </v>

1659
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>fifties when he got into office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Late forties,</v>

1660
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I think a little older than Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>

1661
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And obama to heroin gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just got skinnier somehow just get so</v>

1662
01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:46.040
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

1663
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just because you don't get saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this on stage the other night,</v>

1664
01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the presidents don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three in the morning phone call,</v>

1665
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:53.760
<v Speaker 1>mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President,</v>

1666
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Maine,</v>

1667
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the cat that was in the tray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fire department got the cat down.</v>

1668
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:59.550
<v Speaker 1>The cat's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless you.</v>

1669
01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:02.760
<v Speaker 1>God bless the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get come down to the situation room</v>

1670
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:03.594
<v Speaker 1>and look at the high resolution video </v>
<v Speaker 1>footage of the girls and tests and </v>

1671
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>sailing through the air for the drone </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike that went.</v>

1672
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:09.283
<v Speaker 1>It's zig when it should have zagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get bad news and then they gut </v>

1673
01:14:11.921 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>wrenching decisions where they log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

1674
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:14.463
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going in and all those people are </v>

1675
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's every president makes those</v>

1676
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>decisions and it's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to.</v>

1677
01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't pay me enough that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want a day of it.</v>

1678
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think you either have to be either</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nut or truly think I've got this.</v>

1679
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm neither a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not that kind of megalomaniac</v>

1680
01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:36.274
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't ever think I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what trump is going to </v>

1681
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:40.834
<v Speaker 1>do with a job that has not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the last days of johnson and he </v>

1682
01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't even serve two terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like via the Vietnam war,</v>

1683
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 1>destroyed johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face was falling off his sculpt,</v>

1684
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:55.300
<v Speaker 1>those sad shots of him and mcnamara in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation room with his,</v>

1685
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand is on his cheek and his face is</v>

1686
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 1>falling down his chest because every one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those deaths I think really aggrieved</v>

1687
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:03.993
<v Speaker 1>the presIdent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting president of the </v>

1688
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 1>more you read about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interesting he becomes.</v>

1689
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.530
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's a job that fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroys.</v>

1690
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 1>The only one that didn't seem to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy was clinton.</v>

1691
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:15.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't dunno why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to kind of walk out of there </v>

1692
01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:17.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1693
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1694
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but he looks like shit now.</v>

1695
01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's paid for it now.</v>

1696
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.373
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some sort of the last few </v>

1697
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:25.743
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's damn stressful being running this </v>

1698
01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:29.790
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1699
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 1>and because we're so free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1700
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you've traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No country in the world enjoys our level</v>

1701
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>of freedom and not our kind of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>like even Germany,</v>

1702
01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 1>england,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

1703
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the western world is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not nearly as free as this,</v>

1704
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>and we're so free to try and tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

1705
01:15:46.301 --> 01:15:47.134
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell an american what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sadly the president is part of the </v>

1706
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:51.664
<v Speaker 1>federal government and so the states are</v>
<v Speaker 1>already pissed off at you and any </v>

1707
01:15:54.791 --> 01:15:55.541
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1708
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you get bucketed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went on vacation.</v>

1709
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:57.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's christmAs.</v>

1710
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.310
<v Speaker 1>How dare you go on vacation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1711
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I went to my momma's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1712
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing your mom now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1713
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:04.103
<v Speaker 1>think a president can do where half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country doesn't get mad and we'll see </v>

1714
01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 1>how our new president takes It.</v>

1715
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.533
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be successful because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want every boat in America to be lifted </v>

1716
01:16:13.691 --> 01:16:15.460
<v Speaker 1>by the tide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want good for people.</v>

1717
01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1718
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:18.240
<v Speaker 1>That guy was the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:19.074
<v Speaker 1>I don't want some state to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet because they don't read good or </v>

1720
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not how I want to run it.</v>

1721
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:25.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that he's talking about </v>

1722
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:27.334
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding the infrastructure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting people to work in that regard </v>

1723
01:16:29.591 --> 01:16:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and rebuilding a menu of american </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing.</v>

1724
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:33.034
<v Speaker 1>I hope that really does happen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do get good jobs and the economy </v>

1725
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.500
<v Speaker 1>does rise up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I worry about is all this corporate</v>

1726
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:39.334
<v Speaker 1>raider mentality backed by these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that think that he's somehow or another </v>

1727
01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>looking out for the little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just,</v>

1728
01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1729
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what his motivations are and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder what houses all gonna play out,</v>

1730
01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but I guess everybody does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1731
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.220
<v Speaker 1>to me when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1732
01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:55.810
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new president,</v>

1733
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is unprecedented.</v>

1734
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:57.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1735
01:16:57.641 --> 01:17:00.970
<v Speaker 1>america's have broken 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just keep repeating.</v>

1736
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Trickle down economics would more parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less parts per million in that.</v>

1737
01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>In the early days of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be well landed.</v>

1738
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Gentry in America was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bought land,</v>

1739
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you bought the materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you built your plantation.</v>

1740
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>You bought livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human and animal.</v>

1741
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:20.150
<v Speaker 1>When they bred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kept the offspring,</v>

1742
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring,</v>

1743
01:17:21.741 --> 01:17:22.574
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of It was yours and you got free </v>

1744
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things were great until 18,</v>

1745
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:28.340
<v Speaker 1>65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13th amendment,</v>

1746
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.473
<v Speaker 1>the abolishment of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that mentality of like you had a </v>

1747
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:34.580
<v Speaker 1>good day to day because I didn't beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1748
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>That's your good day and here's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule and what do I pay you?</v>

1749
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:38.993
<v Speaker 1>Your here's your rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back to the field and have another </v>

1750
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 1>day where I don't beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good day for you.</v>

1751
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>That was an un bothered road to a brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia.</v>

1752
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.290
<v Speaker 1>And what you have over the years as </v>
<v Speaker 1>these speed bumps,</v>

1753
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.303
<v Speaker 1>civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you get </v>

1754
01:17:54.981 --> 01:17:57.590
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized apartheid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get jim crow,</v>

1755
01:17:57.591 --> 01:17:58.424
<v Speaker 1>you get an expansion of the clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get segregatIonist laws that sat on </v>

1756
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the books until like brown v board of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

1757
01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:05.450
<v Speaker 1>1954,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1758
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Virginia versus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1759
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:10.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what v Virginia,</v>

1760
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the message donation laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1967,</v>

1761
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 1>oboe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obergefell v hodges,</v>

1762
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 1>marriage equality 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are speed bumps.</v>

1763
01:18:20.541 --> 01:18:21.374
<v Speaker 1>If you're oppressive and you just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get paid this guy what you feel like </v>

1764
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:25.394
<v Speaker 1>giving him minimum wage and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is your enemy because you don't </v>

1765
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>want these people have been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

1766
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 1>And when I think when Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump said,</v>

1767
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:36.140
<v Speaker 1>make America great again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say,</v>

1768
01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:36.974
<v Speaker 1>I think he was talking about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>61 in the years before when I paid you </v>

1769
01:18:41.961 --> 01:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>what I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my factory.</v>

1770
01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 1>How dare the government tell me what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to pay you minimum wage.</v>

1771
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what he means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1772
01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:51.984
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean</v>

1773
01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.893
<v Speaker 1>wait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want you to have a bad </v>

1774
01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

1775
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I have a great factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you a great job.</v>

1776
01:18:56.261 --> 01:18:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I'm going to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rejoice.</v>

1777
01:18:57.911 --> 01:19:00.940
<v Speaker 1>You've got a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not enough to feed my family.</v>

1778
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1779
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 1>beans on the weekend shear up and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1780
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he wakes up every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>going like,</v>

1781
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to murder americans and have them</v>

1782
01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.670
<v Speaker 1>have a crap life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he thinks like,</v>

1783
01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:13.504
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll own stuff and you'll be the </v>

1784
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:18.250
<v Speaker 1>benefIciary as it falls from my mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trickles down to you.</v>

1785
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You'll be happy that I have so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money because I'm a,</v>

1786
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.920
<v Speaker 1>a beneficence master.</v>

1787
01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a guy that's really seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably more of the world than one 10th</v>

1788
01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.040
<v Speaker 3>of one percent of the population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1789
01:19:32.041 --> 01:19:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been to so many different places.</v>

1790
01:19:33.991 --> 01:19:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1791
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:39.010
<v Speaker 3>do you thInk that because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a unique perspective on what is</v>

1792
01:19:39.011 --> 01:19:43.420
<v Speaker 3>possible today because like in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just live in America,</v>

1793
01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:44.254
<v Speaker 3>this is the only thing you've known you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of the world is sort of this sort </v>

1794
01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:47.014
<v Speaker 3>of state that we exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't gone in North Korea </v>

1795
01:19:49.211 --> 01:19:51.480
<v Speaker 3>having on a Mongolia having gone to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different places,</v>

1796
01:19:51.481 --> 01:19:52.314
<v Speaker 3>we see oppressive regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see very bizarre cultures where </v>

1797
01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:56.404
<v Speaker 3>people are rigid in their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move around and rigid in their ability </v>

1798
01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:00.814
<v Speaker 3>to behave and express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see that that could have turned </v>

1799
01:20:04.001 --> 01:20:05.470
<v Speaker 3>out like that here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1800
01:20:05.471 --> 01:20:06.420
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1801
01:20:06.421 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 3>we have this sort</v>

1802
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.993
<v Speaker 1>of experiment in self government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of hobbled along and patched </v>

1803
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.170
<v Speaker 1>up with duct tape and gorilla glue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's here.</v>

1804
01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.373
<v Speaker 1>It's here we are a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's not been a second </v>

1805
01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:21.984
<v Speaker 1>civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more catastrophic than the first shows </v>

1806
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:24.984
<v Speaker 1>you how amazing the constitution is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we disagree a lot between </v>

1807
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the states and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do ultImately get along.</v>

1808
01:20:31.711 --> 01:20:34.200
<v Speaker 1>we're all still united.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did we argue a lot,</v>

1809
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but we're still here and I did two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>of programming for the history channel.</v>

1810
01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to one professor and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me that sent to me.</v>

1811
01:20:42.431 --> 01:20:43.264
<v Speaker 1>He goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a miracle because think of all </v>

1812
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:50.181
<v Speaker 1>the people in this country you disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and yet here we are and what I have</v>

1813
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:51.144
<v Speaker 1>found by travel is what humans can still</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive when somebody go like there's </v>

1814
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:56.810
<v Speaker 1>poverty in America.</v>

1815
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:57.663
<v Speaker 1>Sure there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not poverty lIke you see in </v>

1816
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:00.264
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not poverty like you see in the streets </v>

1817
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 1>of cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>

1818
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.840
<v Speaker 1>There's poverty that no american will </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever experience on in this country.</v>

1819
01:21:08.971 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It'll never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no way.</v>

1820
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.810
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1821
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:13.643
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stick of poverty stick that this </v>

1822
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 1>country will never really whooped with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for other people in the world.</v>

1823
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Millions of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is their entire life.</v>

1824
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:24.503
<v Speaker 1>I was on a boat years ago on my way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>timbuktu with this guy I traveled with </v>

1825
01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:30.810
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a twitter egg man named mahmud.</v>

1826
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.093
<v Speaker 1>I've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the desert music festival </v>

1827
01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:35.880
<v Speaker 1>twice to see all these african is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert music.</v>

1828
01:21:35.881 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 1>There was a festival that had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had in Mali,</v>

1829
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sahara desert.</v>

1830
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And now it's too dangerous of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>festivals no more.</v>

1831
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.250
<v Speaker 1>But I went to go because I buy all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>records from molly and bands.</v>

1832
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.730
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to go see them do it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert.</v>

1833
01:21:47.731 --> 01:21:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So I went in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine or nine and 10,</v>

1834
01:21:50.761 --> 01:21:52.610
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Uh,</v>

1835
01:21:52.611 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I went overland through doggone country </v>
<v Speaker 1>one year and then the next year I hooked</v>

1836
01:21:55.951 --> 01:21:58.010
<v Speaker 1>back up with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mood,</v>

1837
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:01.680
<v Speaker 1>and we took the Niger river on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy chain smokes every day.</v>

1838
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.551
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

1839
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:04.590
<v Speaker 1>mood man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're a freaking chimney.</v>

1840
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to do?</v>

1841
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And he laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1842
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30.</v>

1843
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to Be dead two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people in his tribe get about 28</v>

1844
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 1>to 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1845
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Hunter laughed and kept smoking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1846
01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've learned by travel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what humans can still,</v>

1847
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:24.210
<v Speaker 1>how they can still live in spite of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1848
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:29.750
<v Speaker 1>what their circumstances are and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means to me when I get back here is</v>

1849
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot to lose.</v>

1850
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.653
<v Speaker 1>I mean iT can get so much worse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still get by because he was just </v>

1851
01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 1>so resourceful and were so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But w,</v>

1852
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:41.214
<v Speaker 1>w we shouldn't ever have to go near that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're smarter than that and you </v>

1853
01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:46.680
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and this other guy might disagree and</v>

1854
01:22:46.681 --> 01:22:48.780
<v Speaker 1>he might call me a bunch of nasty names </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the internet,</v>

1855
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately does he really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill me?</v>

1856
01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was in a burning car,</v>

1857
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:55.374
<v Speaker 1>would he try and pull me out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably If I had a sandwich and he was </v>

1858
01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.280
<v Speaker 1>hungry when I give him half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1859
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.553
<v Speaker 1>And I think to forget that aspect of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since at least the bush </v>

1860
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>administration with the polarization in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country has been so extreme,</v>

1861
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.293
<v Speaker 1>I think we have started to forget that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be there for each other and I'm </v>

1862
01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:16.870
<v Speaker 1>not saying we all need to have a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>group hug,</v>

1863
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but when we are having such vociferous </v>
<v Speaker 1>dIsagreements about healthcare,</v>

1864
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:23.140
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about people being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

1865
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are we arguing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1866
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just making a system where </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the little old lady doesn't have to</v>

1867
01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>be in fear of dying alone with heaters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't work or whatever.</v>

1868
01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:34.391
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1869
01:23:34.391 --> 01:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>we have such a beautiful patch of land </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1870
01:23:37.361 --> 01:23:38.194
<v Speaker 1>I've been all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some parts where people live </v>

1871
01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:40.763
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you people doing here like </v>

1872
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This part of africa wants you dead.</v>

1873
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Why are you here as where we live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where America by we are.</v>

1874
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:51.820
<v Speaker 1>This is one long vacation we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America as far as climate.</v>

1875
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.233
<v Speaker 1>It gets cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can always boogie down the road </v>

1876
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.920
<v Speaker 1>to miami in a greyhound bus in seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1877
01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Be on your shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1878
01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:01.090
<v Speaker 1>we've got a good here in every possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1879
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1880
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>we certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really do.</v>

1881
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:04.263
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important what you </v>

1882
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.943
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people on the Internet and that </v>

1883
01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of bizarre communication that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced today.</v>

1884
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember pre-internet,</v>

1885
01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a grown man before the internet</v>

1886
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 1>came around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that this,</v>

1887
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.393
<v Speaker 1>this existence that we have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are sort of communicating </v>

1888
01:24:23.921 --> 01:24:26.140
<v Speaker 1>without looking at each other without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being there,</v>

1889
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>let's be really cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>

1890
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:29.223
<v Speaker 1>Without social cues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without it feeling emotions because of </v>

1891
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:34.960
<v Speaker 1>cruel statements without like looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in the eye.</v>

1892
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't really feel lIke we're designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to communicate like this and it's.</v>

1893
01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.413
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly goes against how I was </v>

1894
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 1>raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

1895
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:44.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange time in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1896
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.603
<v Speaker 1>and it leads to a lot of pettiness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just really mean stuff where the issuer </v>

1897
01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.910
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means,</v>

1898
01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:52.803
<v Speaker 1>email or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they look back at that a </v>

1899
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.001
<v Speaker 1>week later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1900
01:24:55.001 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Speaker 1>well man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was I that afternoon?</v>

1901
01:24:57.041 --> 01:24:57.874
<v Speaker 1>Because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's stuff you can read because it </v>

1902
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 1>peels the paint off your car.</v>

1903
01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I go on these chat room websites </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just read.</v>

1904
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:05.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever post things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read and when we had our last </v>

1905
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:08.314
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is things said about him and his </v>

1906
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.320
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1907
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.570
<v Speaker 1>did you just write?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was depressing.</v>

1908
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.713
<v Speaker 1>Like I read like three hours one night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a 2000 and something like a </v>

1909
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:18.790
<v Speaker 1>baboon's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man.</v>

1910
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just happened.</v>

1911
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Like someone actually thinks that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1912
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is when they get </v>

1913
01:25:26.651 --> 01:25:27.484
<v Speaker 1>found out and someone exposes whoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote that and then they focus on them </v>

1914
01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:33.520
<v Speaker 1>publicly and you see the scrutiny of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>

1915
01:25:33.521 --> 01:25:34.354
<v Speaker 1>if not millions of people come down </v>
<v Speaker 1>those folks and how they fuck those </v>

1916
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:39.760
<v Speaker 1>people turn into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turned into that same monster.</v>

1917
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:40.803
<v Speaker 1>They have the green light to go after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and and all of a sudden know it's </v>

1918
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>like a twilight zone episode.</v>

1919
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Like now you got the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1920
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you hitting that guy?</v>

1921
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Because he was hitting a guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

1922
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And so I come and I'm sure you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with this,</v>

1923
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I come from the world of if you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1924
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.750
<v Speaker 1>that guy comes around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go like,</v>

1925
01:25:58.751 --> 01:25:59.800
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wham.</v>

1926
01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>And he just broke your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I never say anything about anyone</v>

1927
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 1>not expecting to turn the corner and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>face to face with that person.</v>

1928
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And so If I ever talked about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician or you know,</v>

1929
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:13.304
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of disagreements with judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>scalia and people like that and I'd </v>

1930
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:17.324
<v Speaker 1>write about it in the la weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have loved to have debated the </v>

1931
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:20.654
<v Speaker 1>14th amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The antonin scalia has said it didn't </v>

1932
01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>have any of the traction that I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

1933
01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 1>And at any politician like bucket on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including trump,</v>

1934
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>which I have the 14th amendment again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the four equal protection under the law.</v>

1935
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:32.983
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>68 is basically if you're born and </v>

1936
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:35.174
<v Speaker 1>raised here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get all the same protections as the </v>

1937
01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>wealthy land guy is basically slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

1938
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:40.303
<v Speaker 1>It was one that came after the 13th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was to shore up the 13th </v>

1939
01:26:42.381 --> 01:26:43.214
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SlaverY is my favorite amendment of the </v>

1940
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:46.850
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's five clauses,</v>

1941
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1942
01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:50.084
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and five are basically governmental </v>

1943
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:52.184
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the first paragraph and it's </v>

1944
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:55.310
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1945
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.173
<v Speaker 1>the all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all people born and naturalized in the </v>

1946
01:26:57.441 --> 01:26:58.274
<v Speaker 1>United States are a resident of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and of the state wherein </v>

1947
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they reside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>

1948
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.943
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a beautiful thing and I think </v>

1949
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that was put in place to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>racists,</v>

1950
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood that the 13th amendment </v>

1951
01:27:11.481 --> 01:27:14.220
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gives like,</v>

1952
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

1953
01:27:15.261 --> 01:27:16.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an anchor baby.</v>

1954
01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That's just the 14th amendment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scalia didn't,</v>

1955
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:21.210
<v Speaker 1>he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1956
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.170
<v Speaker 1>a descent on obergefell v hodges.</v>

1957
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:26.300
<v Speaker 1>He came down very hard on the 14th </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment,</v>

1958
01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:27.950
<v Speaker 1>which is my personal favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1959
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but my rationale is if I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

1960
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.213
<v Speaker 1>I expect to see that guy within five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and have to answer for what I </v>

1961
01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:40.850
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1962
01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I am very careful with what I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

1963
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:44.223
<v Speaker 1>I take responsibility for what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said something mean about dick </v>

1964
01:27:47.391 --> 01:27:48.051
<v Speaker 1>cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1965
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right over here.</v>

1966
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I talk please?</v>

1967
01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to him.</v>

1968
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 1>If you stare at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned to stone.</v>

1969
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:56.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1970
01:27:56.361 --> 01:28:01.361
<v Speaker 1>I just don't say anything that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to because I just met ann coulter.</v>

1971
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you wrote that thing about her,</v>

1972
01:28:03.631 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 1>you know that thing I wrote about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was a video.</v>

1973
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You writing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1975
01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:11.000
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thank you very much.</v>

1976
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to meet ann coulter and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 1>spend an evening with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just figure out,</v>

1978
01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1979
01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 1>He gets so much self loathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

1980
01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.720
<v Speaker 1>She's so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know one,</v>

1981
01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 1>a female comedian who I'm sure you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well aware of.</v>

1982
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she knows her well,</v>

1983
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:27.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've met on like bill maher or </v>

1984
01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:29.144
<v Speaker 1>something and I said what she likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said the self-loathing is like just </v>

1985
01:28:32.301 --> 01:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not a bad person.</v>

1986
01:28:34.131 --> 01:28:34.964
<v Speaker 1>you feel kind of sorry for when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the green room with her because she </v>

1987
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:38.680
<v Speaker 1>does hates her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1988
01:28:38.681 --> 01:28:41.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ms dot cuLture is not here to defend</v>

1989
01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:41.984
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1990
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's not a bad person.</v>

1991
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reads every tweet about herself and she </v>

1993
01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>stays up at night with all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1994
01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.520
<v Speaker 3>bill maher's friends with her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've always found very odd,</v>

1995
01:28:53.521 --> 01:28:57.870
<v Speaker 3>like he talks about early as his friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he has her on and they joke around,</v>

1996
01:28:57.871 --> 01:28:59.610
<v Speaker 3>they're jovIal together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1997
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1998
01:29:00.901 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 3>they're well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is she?</v>

1999
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Is she that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is she this thing?</v>

2000
01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>She's a little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So a little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bit of an advocate.</v>

2002
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:10.350
<v Speaker 1>She knows that she says stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the top.</v>

2003
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It helps her sell books and gets her </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime.</v>

2004
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Recent one with the trump book she wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2005
01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 1>just the cover alone was like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre,</v>

2006
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:18.623
<v Speaker 1>but it's there to piss you off or get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you inspired and eventually you can go </v>

2007
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:23.274
<v Speaker 1>to some market and buy those books for </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5 because honestly they don't sell and </v>

2008
01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:30.373
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can buy them for five </v>

2009
01:29:32.611 --> 01:29:33.840
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a few of her books.</v>

2010
01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I bought them at places like costco with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big sticker on them.</v>

2011
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I've read like a couple of her books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gO through fast.</v>

2012
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.531
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>

2013
01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bushes,</v>

2014
01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.100
<v Speaker 1>autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that at costco.</v>

2015
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.590
<v Speaker 1>She wrote a bush hog autobiography of </v>
<v Speaker 1>George W.</v>

2016
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:48.423
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

2017
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a krill,</v>

2018
01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:51.620
<v Speaker 1>a coloriNg book for adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no footnotes.</v>

2019
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:52.463
<v Speaker 1>There's no index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of ended up liking him </v>

2020
01:29:53.911 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>after the book is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he just did.</v>

2022
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like the worst guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm going to find </v>

2045
01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:52.524
<v Speaker 1>consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm honestly interested in finding </v>

2046
01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 1>out where this guy gets off because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't offend me.</v>

2047
01:30:57.181 --> 01:30:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of feel bad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you feel bad for them?</v>

2048
01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Just because It's a lot of ag rhoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kinda drag around.</v>

2049
01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to kind of invent all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2050
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:08.540
<v Speaker 1>She sat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say it pal.</v>

2051
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:11.490
<v Speaker 1>You're just manufacturing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be a real drag to.</v>

2052
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see the two of you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked together.</v>

2053
01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that be kind of fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually enjoy milo.</v>

2054
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy his company.</v>

2055
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a bad guy,</v>

2056
01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:20.670
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the stuff he says is </v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded,</v>

2057
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.653
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's trying to get somebody to jump </v>

2058
01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:24.670
<v Speaker 1>out of their seat for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2059
01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and he has a book coming out called </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

2060
01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:28.674
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His whole thing is the dangerous faggot </v>

2061
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2062
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:33.840
<v Speaker 1>we can't have that on the cover of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2063
01:31:33.841 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 1>so it's just dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2064
01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:36.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2065
01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I went to amazon and sho nuff it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out next march I believe.</v>

2066
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probabLy be a best seller.</v>

2067
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:44.430
<v Speaker 1>He's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2068
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2069
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I know he's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was just interested to see.</v>

2070
01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:49.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2071
01:31:49.341 --> 01:31:50.174
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2072
01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.053
<v Speaker 1>a big part of dick cheney's </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography is fascinating because it </v>

2073
01:31:55.251 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 1>in latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ancient latin,</v>

2074
01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:57.841
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2075
01:31:57.841 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>the guys had 80 lights.</v>

2076
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's like served under like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents or something.</v>

2077
01:32:01.571 --> 01:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a boring guy.</v>

2078
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It's been a very interesting life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2079
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:05.770
<v Speaker 1>nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ford,</v>

2080
01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 1>reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been in the oval office a lot.</v>

2081
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 1>It's been in that building a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows where all the bodies are buried</v>

2082
01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to live with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2083
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2084
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:19.450
<v Speaker 1>reading what they have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2085
01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious in that way and that I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know what's on someone's mind I might</v>

2086
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>not agree with all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2087
01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:28.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way to broaden your </v>

2088
01:32:28.991 --> 01:32:31.520
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an idea of how they're actually.</v>

2089
01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Yet everyone is essentially coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

2090
01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.700
<v Speaker 1>their version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's acting class,</v>

2091
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:37.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be in that moment or </v>

2092
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:40.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I'd see these trump rallies,</v>

2093
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 1>these people really do hate hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinton.</v>

2094
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:46.420
<v Speaker 1>They hate barack obama and they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>do want to build that wall.</v>

2095
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.553
<v Speaker 1>It's all his real is me sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you right now and I might not </v>

2096
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't not say they're sincere.</v>

2097
01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.693
<v Speaker 1>They're burning analog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is as real as anything you've ever </v>

2098
01:32:57.251 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 1>felt as real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want to get into the</v>

2099
01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:03.670
<v Speaker 1>inner mechanics of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that person because I kind of already</v>

2100
01:33:03.671 --> 01:33:04.504
<v Speaker 1>know where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of scene of phobia and half </v>

2101
01:33:06.341 --> 01:33:10.480
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say that they're not legit</v>

2102
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:15.700
<v Speaker 1>and you just saw that they spoke quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>loudly and Mr.</v>

2103
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.533
<v Speaker 1>Trump one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not the popular vote but the </v>

2104
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:19.354
<v Speaker 1>electoral college certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to know more about who I </v>

2105
01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.570
<v Speaker 1>share a country with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cAn't spend all day with it,</v>

2106
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but I do designate some bit of the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and figure this out.</v>

2107
01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.293
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get up the road if you don't </v>

2108
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:32.680
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>

2109
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want my enemies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2110
01:33:35.381 --> 01:33:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want enemies in my own country.</v>

2111
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.780
<v Speaker 1>People that disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately I want to get up the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them in order to do that.</v>

2113
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.053
<v Speaker 1>I can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get beat up by some guy </v>

2114
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:49.804
<v Speaker 1>getting out of his pickup truck to drill</v>
<v Speaker 1>some freedom Into my forehead with his </v>

2115
01:33:52.511 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 1>fists because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2116
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not built for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who is.</v>

2117
01:33:57.430 --> 01:34:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking for a higher way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the road.</v>

2118
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not all that hopeful,</v>

2119
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2120
01:34:04.521 --> 01:34:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I still try and dissect it that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>forensically go through that,</v>

2121
01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that american id because I travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>through America.</v>

2122
01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:12.814
<v Speaker 1>It's what I've been doing for 36 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meet more americans than any </v>

2123
01:34:15.101 --> 01:34:16.900
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear the stories,</v>

2124
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.580
<v Speaker 1>like you hear the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>henry,</v>

2125
01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:21.650
<v Speaker 1>my friend died in Iraq and he loved you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hear that story.</v>

2126
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:22.483
<v Speaker 1>It might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend killed himself last month and </v>

2127
01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm really screwed up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about it.</v>

2128
01:34:26.201 --> 01:34:30.250
<v Speaker 1>So I hear I get a lot of input and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you like all these people,</v>

2129
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 1>like on the fat gay guy in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one likes me and my parents kicked me</v>

2130
01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:36.670
<v Speaker 1>out of the house when I was 18 because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cain and like,</v>

2131
01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:37.721
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

2132
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:40.160
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be that at anyone.</v>

2133
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.013
<v Speaker 1>When you hear stories like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you want to do is like give them a </v>

2134
01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:45.700
<v Speaker 1>divo record and keep breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid don't,</v>

2135
01:34:45.701 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 1>don't self harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the more stories I hear,</v>

2136
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it makes me want to be more decent to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow americans understand us better.</v>

2137
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons I travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>globally.</v>

2138
01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons I do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows in America</v>

2139
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:03.610
<v Speaker 2>and I do a lot of listening and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we don't do anymore.</v>

2140
01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 2>We listed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you logged on at patriot one 85</v>

2141
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>and you give some liberal snowflake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they call these people,</v>

2142
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some grief on the internet,</v>

2143
01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:13.004
<v Speaker 2>you're only listening to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You disliked disagreeing with people in </v>

2144
01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 2>piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very frat boy.</v>

2145
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you definitely can get it into an </v>

2146
01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:22.100
<v Speaker 2>echo chamber and lose perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get out.</v>

2147
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2148
01:35:22.851 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying is beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>

2149
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:25.934
<v Speaker 2>it is a good idea to have an open mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to find out why these people </v>

2150
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:33.830
<v Speaker 2>think in diametrically opposed ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you think or what.</v>

2151
01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Find out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the motivation,</v>

2152
01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:36.824
<v Speaker 2>what was their background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would cause them to reach this </v>

2153
01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 2>conclusion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultImately,</v>

2154
01:35:40.341 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 2>how can we get going because life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>short and I want renewable energy and my</v>

2155
01:35:45.321 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2156
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to be feared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want solar panels to be,</v>

2157
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of this.</v>

2158
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Who says so panels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

2159
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that whole idea of like,</v>

2160
01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:55.934
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you a science guy with your </v>

2161
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:57.081
<v Speaker 2>pussy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2162
01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:57.914
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2163
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what scientists are,</v>

2164
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>

2165
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you tweet something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>global climate change,</v>

2166
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:06.043
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>these trump ets jump on board and they </v>

2167
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:14.090
<v Speaker 2>start attacking what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then tweeting,</v>

2168
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they've researched it or</v>

2169
01:36:17.091 --> 01:36:17.924
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like immediate attitude </v>

2170
01:36:19.521 --> 01:36:22.240
<v Speaker 2>that the people on the right seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have where they had.</v>

2171
01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:26.780
<v Speaker 2>They immediately want to dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that diminishes industry.</v>

2172
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:31.781
<v Speaker 2>Anything about climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that protects the environment,</v>

2173
01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.180
<v Speaker 2>whether it's about this dakota pipeline </v>
<v Speaker 2>access thing,</v>

2174
01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2175
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.000
<v Speaker 2>the trump has just getting involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

2176
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he green lIt it.</v>

2177
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's intense.</v>

2178
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what that was going on during </v>

2179
01:36:42.621 --> 01:36:43.454
<v Speaker 2>the obama administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that people need to </v>

2180
01:36:44.601 --> 01:36:45.434
<v Speaker 2>recognize that there's not a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking president that's really looking </v>

2181
01:36:47.421 --> 01:36:48.254
<v Speaker 2>out for you and never has been won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not one that you could really </v>

2182
01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:51.224
<v Speaker 2>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single one of them is doing some </v>

2183
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:54.800
<v Speaker 2>creepy shit and that whole thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

2184
01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.050
<v Speaker 2>They were cutting easements through </v>
<v Speaker 2>private land.</v>

2185
01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 2>They were arresting people on their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking land.</v>

2186
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.300
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that they had the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drill through their land.</v>

2187
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:06.290
<v Speaker 2>That was during the obama administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>started during his administration,</v>

2188
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:09.350
<v Speaker 2>supported by administration and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped at towards the end,</v>

2189
01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:10.543
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like I kind of know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped it knowing that trump was </v>

2190
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:14.390
<v Speaker 2>going to start it right the fuck back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2191
01:37:14.391 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he got in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the last few months of obama,</v>

2192
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:21.490
<v Speaker 2>that's why he kicked the russians out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're like,</v>

2193
01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:22.483
<v Speaker 2>let trump bring them back and let let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me be the bad guy and get that </v>

2194
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 2>headline and he'll green light that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pipeline.</v>

2195
01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I think obama had some fun on the waY </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2196
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:35.020
<v Speaker 2>knowing that trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:35.873
<v Speaker 2>first week is going to turn it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and everyone gets to point the </v>

2198
01:37:38.421 --> 01:37:39.254
<v Speaker 2>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's politics and that's why I don't </v>

2199
01:37:41.031 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 2>love any politician and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to meet one.</v>

2200
01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2201
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from Washington dc,</v>

2202
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.460
<v Speaker 2>you'd see them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2203
01:37:48.461 --> 01:37:50.570
<v Speaker 2>they got to eat somewhere and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2204
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't walk five blocks to go meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2205
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to meet jimmy carter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

2206
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>probably the only guy that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to see him speak just because,</v>

2207
01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never watched a president speak.</v>

2208
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2209
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind meeting jimmy carter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just kind of know they're all kind</v>

2210
01:38:09.121 --> 01:38:11.910
<v Speaker 1>of cut from kind of the same bolt of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloth,</v>

2211
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 1>just the different amounts of puke on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cloth.</v>

2212
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.553
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if it's raining outside and </v>

2213
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>they're outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wet.</v>

2214
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everyone's score.</v>

2215
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Vidal said by the time you get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive office,</v>

2216
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 1>you've been bought and sold at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen times willfully.</v>

2217
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:31.860
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By being a good person,</v>

2218
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.600
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much of it you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix,</v>

2219
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:38.601
<v Speaker 1>the only way to fix it is to go local </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like when trump became president,</v>

2220
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I just did eight shows at largo in la </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people were kind of failing</v>

2221
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:44.933
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2222
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.043
<v Speaker 1>when they start pushing against lgbt </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights or women's reproductive health </v>

2223
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 1>rights or freedoms will neutralize </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

2224
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:54.570
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2225
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 1>planned parenthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clu,</v>

2226
01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.940
<v Speaker 1>a southern poverty law center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lgbt activist group.</v>

2227
01:38:59.941 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 1>We can get involved and start kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutralizing this and slowing it down.</v>

2228
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And this is not a time to be dismayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2229
01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:06.453
<v Speaker 1>thIs is punk rock time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what joe strummer trains you </v>

2230
01:39:07.951 --> 01:39:09.240
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is now time to go.</v>

2231
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:14.420
<v Speaker 1>You're a good person means that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>more now than ever because as a voter,</v>

2232
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw your penny throat in the seat.</v>

2233
01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.600
<v Speaker 1>That's all a vote is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like nothing.</v>

2234
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even hear it fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>

2235
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:22.343
<v Speaker 1>You can be thunderous in your own life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being cool to the eight people </v>

2236
01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>around you and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2237
01:39:26.611 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it rubs off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is viral,</v>

2238
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:30.830
<v Speaker 1>it resonates it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2239
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 1>and so I work locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2240
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 1>As far as my eyes can see.</v>

2241
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an orphanage in,</v>

2242
01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:40.650
<v Speaker 1>in los angeles I contributed money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

2243
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 1>They've kind of morphed into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else now,</v>

2244
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but I work locally and if everyone did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone worked like,</v>

2245
01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a yard in front of them.</v>

2246
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It started looking really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to change the world.</v>

2247
01:39:50.611 --> 01:39:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You can just change your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your street and changIng the world.</v>

2248
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:57.450
<v Speaker 1>What a daunting task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it happens when enough people change</v>

2249
01:39:57.451 --> 01:40:01.080
<v Speaker 1>theIr street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as a los angeles resident,</v>

2250
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to work inside the county </v>
<v Speaker 1>of la doing good stuff.</v>

2251
01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I can figure out to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to you because you,</v>

2252
01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to push congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2253
01:40:10.801 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>THey seem to be loving to sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit still.</v>

2254
01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can work locally and so going </v>

2255
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:19.360
<v Speaker 1>forward in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2256
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 1>When it gets better is when the electric</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets better.</v>

2257
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.553
<v Speaker 1>As with jefferson taught you a vigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated electorate who votes and votes </v>

2258
01:40:25.831 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 1>and votes to keep an american government</v>
<v Speaker 1>and democracy,</v>

2259
01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:33.240
<v Speaker 1>a transparent lens as transparent as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

2260
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you can do in this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't.</v>

2261
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to move to Canada like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the canadians are going to have you,</v>

2262
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your decency now means more.</v>

2263
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more into a fruitful currency.</v>

2264
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It just means more now to help that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2265
01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It's it's healthier help basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feeling great things get done in times</v>

2266
01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:56.200
<v Speaker 1>of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2267
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.093
<v Speaker 1>We have something to push back against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People organized like that woman's </v>

2268
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:02.620
<v Speaker 1>march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know exactly where you go,</v>

2269
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:04.810
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decency is under threat.</v>

2270
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.093
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go and all of a sudden your life </v>

2271
01:41:08.411 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 1>has some definition or like I like add </v>
<v Speaker 1>the serial relationships.</v>

2272
01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking to get into an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

2273
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like when I go on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not me versus the audience.</v>

2274
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It's me versus the stress and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude of the tour.</v>

2275
01:41:22.301 --> 01:41:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I've bitten off for myself and I get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of failing my audience.</v>

2276
01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I love that and I battled that fear all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2277
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:29.974
<v Speaker 1>Go to the gym becauSe you better put </v>
<v Speaker 1>eIght miles on that treadmill because </v>

2278
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:33.034
<v Speaker 1>you got a show tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a sort of damocles over your </v>

2279
01:41:34.961 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat the pizza.</v>

2280
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Eat that because you've got a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

2281
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.003
<v Speaker 1>Don't this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you decided to do like eight miles </v>

2282
01:41:40.841 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 1>on a treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel like that benefits?</v>

2283
01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 1>You want to do a show mental toughness </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm tired,</v>

2284
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:47.134
<v Speaker 1>I'm jet lagged and I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage and 40 minutes I'm so damn </v>

2285
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:50.464
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all that training comes in and </v>

2286
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.661
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2287
01:41:52.661 --> 01:41:54.280
<v Speaker 1>this can probably be the best show I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done.</v>

2288
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 1>They start laughing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2289
01:41:55.961 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm really tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThIs is going to be awesome,</v>

2290
01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and you go out there and crush it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you do your shows,</v>

2291
01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:03.420
<v Speaker 1>do you write it out in a long form?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2292
01:42:03.421 --> 01:42:04.254
<v Speaker 1>but you know I've already written yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already written out in my journal </v>

2293
01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 1>because those journals become books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tAke tons of write longhand type.</v>

2294
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Both on my leisure days I'd like to hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

2295
01:42:12.031 --> 01:42:12.864
<v Speaker 1>so I just like writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mainly I don't have the time so I </v>

2296
01:42:14.681 --> 01:42:15.700
<v Speaker 1>got to type it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Left.</v>

2297
01:42:15.701 --> 01:42:16.810
<v Speaker 1>He left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left headed.</v>

2298
01:42:16.811 --> 01:42:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2299
01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.813
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned that you can't take too </v>

2300
01:42:21.701 --> 01:42:22.534
<v Speaker 1>many notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YoU can't write enough like you have to </v>

2301
01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:24.873
<v Speaker 1>take add details of the last hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it the next day because you're </v>

2302
01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I'm on stage I have no notes</v>

2303
01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's all in the front of my brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>pan.</v>

2304
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm going to quote the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution or quota precedent or years</v>

2305
01:42:37.631 --> 01:42:40.480
<v Speaker 1>that the supreme court did Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to put it.</v>

2306
01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I memorize all of it and I just carry it</v>
<v Speaker 1>around with me.</v>

2307
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And before I go on stage to center </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

2308
01:42:46.811 --> 01:42:47.231
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2309
01:42:47.231 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quote lincoln from,</v>

2310
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:50.104
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his speech for the speech to the </v>

2311
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:54.250
<v Speaker 1>perpetuation of our governmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

2312
01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's calleD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

2313
01:42:55.661 --> 01:42:58.390
<v Speaker 1>the speeCh to the young men's lyceum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been quoted.</v>

2314
01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Florida's first ever speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really young.</v>

2315
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>38.</v>

2316
01:43:02.741 --> 01:43:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in early january.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2317
01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:06.144
<v Speaker 1>I just quote parts of it to myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda get ready to go out there and so </v>

2318
01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>does that help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eliminates the rest of the day.</v>

2319
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So It's like all I have in my life as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2320
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole life is tonight and it's,</v>

2321
01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it says I don't want anything else in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

2322
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it was bjorn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bjorn bork,</v>

2323
01:43:25.691 --> 01:43:28.630
<v Speaker 1>some elite tennis player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2324
01:43:29.010 --> 01:43:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I've read this in sports illustrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>

2325
01:43:30.911 --> 01:43:31.744
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just basically concentrate to </v>

2326
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:35.350
<v Speaker 1>eliminate everything that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

2327
01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll work.</v>

2328
01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Then I was hyperactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

2329
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It took me years to be able to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace that.</v>

2330
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:47.290
<v Speaker 1>But when I go on stage after a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 and 25 days,</v>

2331
01:43:47.291 --> 01:43:49.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing getting you through it is</v>

2332
01:43:49.061 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>your love of being onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My of the audIence.</v>

2333
01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:52.853
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just crazy obsessive and just the </v>

2334
01:43:57.051 --> 01:43:57.884
<v Speaker 1>fact that I'm not thinking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired I am and how tired I'm going to </v>

2335
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just all there is.</v>

2336
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:08.050
<v Speaker 1>They go and go and I walk out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent the last hour eliminating the</v>

2337
01:44:09.141 --> 01:44:12.020
<v Speaker 1>other parts of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you have an outline of what you're</v>

2338
01:44:12.021 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about in my mind?</v>

2339
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only in your mind.</v>

2340
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:44:15.801 --> 01:44:16.634
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll at the beginning of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour just to kind of get back in that </v>

2342
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:23.840
<v Speaker 1>groove all I'll write a page of notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about this into that,</v>

2343
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.770
<v Speaker 1>into that and I look at it and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk it through in my mind and like,</v>

2344
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:28.604
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically memorized all the </v>

2345
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:32.200
<v Speaker 1>furniture in the living room so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>run through it with your eyes closed and</v>

2346
01:44:32.201 --> 01:44:36.840
<v Speaker 1>not bump into anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I go on stage one thing,</v>

2347
01:44:36.841 --> 01:44:41.841
<v Speaker 1>so tends to go into the next and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I have a stopwatch.</v>

2348
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I bring it on stage and put it down for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience's benefit,</v>

2349
01:44:44.571 --> 01:44:46.250
<v Speaker 1>not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I don't,</v>

2350
01:44:46.251 --> 01:44:47.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not careful,</v>

2351
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.080
<v Speaker 1>the shows we'll go well over two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look down like,</v>

2352
01:44:51.081 --> 01:44:52.490
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these poor people,</v>

2353
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:53.324
<v Speaker 1>I got to certain landing this thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any story takes you like 20 minutes to </v>

2354
01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intend to get out.</v>

2355
01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.273
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2356
01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 1>we're taxiing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the runway and I'll let him go</v>

2357
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:02.084
<v Speaker 1>in 15 minutes and I apologize I've kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>you here for like two hours and 20 </v>

2358
01:45:04.911 --> 01:45:05.840
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sorry.</v>

2359
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I swear I'll be done with you and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 more minutes,</v>

2360
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine they'd want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like no dude more.</v>

2361
01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:12.363
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2362
01:45:12.570 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to keep them there for</v>

2363
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:16.040
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

2364
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but I can't write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to abuse.</v>

2365
01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's want to leave them wanting more and</v>

2366
01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.290
<v Speaker 1>just don't leave them going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2367
01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that was really long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never coming back to this again.</v>

2368
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.113
<v Speaker 1>That was like having four molders being </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled because I always tell them I'm </v>

2369
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 1>desperate for your attention and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>approval.</v>

2370
01:45:32.181 --> 01:45:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I really need you to keep showing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because without you on the tree,</v>

2371
01:45:35.301 --> 01:45:36.920
<v Speaker 1>that falls in the forest on witnessed.</v>

2372
01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.511
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2373
01:45:37.511 --> 01:45:38.900

<v Speaker 1>show tour,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll have one or two big centerpiece </v>

2381
01:45:50.661 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 1>stories like on the last tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2382
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:54.103
<v Speaker 1>many nights of the week I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I had lunch with david bowie </v>

2383
01:45:57.230 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 1>because he had passed away last year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really,</v>

2384
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.823
<v Speaker 1>really cool to me and it's a fun story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told some lemmy stories because </v>

2385
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.810
<v Speaker 1>let me from motorhead had died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2386
01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 1>in the weeks before the tour started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2387
01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:08.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2388
01:46:08.691 --> 01:46:09.524
<v Speaker 1>lemmys gone and my fans are very big on </v>
<v Speaker 1>lemmy and motorhead and I have a lot of </v>

2389
01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:15.584
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with lemmy a lot and he's </v>

2390
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 1>just a wonderful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really amazing guy.</v>

2391
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:20.413
<v Speaker 1>So I would tell some stories and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>would kind of fall in and fall out and </v>

2392
01:46:23.991 --> 01:46:24.824
<v Speaker 1>then things would happen in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would come into the mix and I </v>

2393
01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if something is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>

2394
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I can connect it to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like almost any country that falls down,</v>

2395
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I've probably been there and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2396
01:46:38.031 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened in Syria today.</v>

2397
01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:41.893
<v Speaker 1>Now when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in pull my afternoon and the l </v>

2398
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:47.200
<v Speaker 1>hideous story out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2399
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>and so I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2400
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I was on route ru paul's a longtime </v>
<v Speaker 1>palomar iso,</v>

2401
01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2402
01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an amazing human being.</v>

2403
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

2404
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:02.970
<v Speaker 1>And his had to run more than once </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a big black guy in a wig.</v>

2405
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.833
<v Speaker 1>I mean someone wants to beat him up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just one of the more extraordinary </v>

2406
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:07.350
<v Speaker 1>people I've ever met.</v>

2407
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And I met him at band practice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

2408
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 1>He prActice down the hall from us and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>became pals.</v>

2409
01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I talked about the time I was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>rupaul's drag race is a judge,</v>

2410
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:18.264
<v Speaker 1>which was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I talKed about that story because I </v>

2411
01:47:21.391 --> 01:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>was just on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ru paul,</v>

2412
01:47:22.741 --> 01:47:23.574
<v Speaker 1>dr three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dr he puts a microphone on you in a </v>

2413
01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:25.824
<v Speaker 1>gopro camera and he drives you around la</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing errands and he interviews you and </v>

2414
01:47:28.981 --> 01:47:29.814
<v Speaker 1>he chops it up into content and so was </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to tell my being a judge on </v>

2415
01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 1>rupaul's drag race story because I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>segue into the day we ran errands,</v>

2416
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the normal places I go because I live </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

2417
01:47:41.401 --> 01:47:42.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much a solitary type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd made this story about how I walked </v>

2418
01:47:45.511 --> 01:47:49.170
<v Speaker 1>into all these places and the only time </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever come in with someone else's.</v>

2419
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:50.003
<v Speaker 1>The one time I walked in with a six and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half foot tall black guy and everyone </v>

2420
01:47:54.181 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 1>who knows me and all these stores skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2421
01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>henry's finally found someone,</v>

2422
01:47:58.410 --> 01:47:59.243
<v Speaker 1>and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a story about perception because </v>

2423
01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you'd see the looks on their face like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2424
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:06.150
<v Speaker 1>hey henry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2425
01:48:06.151 --> 01:48:06.984
<v Speaker 1>I always thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hilarious and rupaul and I would </v>

2426
01:48:10.201 --> 01:48:13.350
<v Speaker 1>leave these places would just laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterically because they think we're an</v>

2427
01:48:13.351 --> 01:48:14.184
<v Speaker 1>item.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we eventually had lunch in west la </v>

2428
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:20.700
<v Speaker 1>and we were recognized by everyone on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sidewalks immediately.</v>

2429
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 1>People are taking photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2430
01:48:23.071 --> 01:48:25.610
<v Speaker 1>ru paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've become a power couple was.</v>

2431
01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And this to me is an anecdote I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell onstage.</v>

2432
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not making up humor.</v>

2433
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:34.614
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2434
01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happened that was funny.</v>

2435
01:48:36.421 --> 01:48:37.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how I get the humor.</v>

2436
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I basically stumbled into it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoops,</v>

2437
01:48:39.691 --> 01:48:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I got humor on my shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was funny because I got email,</v>

2438
01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going out with ru paul.</v>

2439
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And I would write back these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

2440
01:48:47.881 --> 01:48:50.220
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous email letters back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2441
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:51.054
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a new couple we don't want external </v>

2442
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:58.050
<v Speaker 1>factors to determine what this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

2443
01:48:58.051 --> 01:49:02.070
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're just going with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow and there's some kid in the midwest</v>

2444
01:49:02.071 --> 01:49:05.220
<v Speaker 1>who's head just exploded because I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>him back.</v>

2445
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:06.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2446
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 1>we're just checkIng it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him post that wherever he wants.</v>

2447
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what informs the shows.</v>

2448
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.450
<v Speaker 1>As the tour rolls out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story will be in the,</v>

2449
01:49:19.451 --> 01:49:20.284
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do like 20 nights with that and </v>

2450
01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:22.374
<v Speaker 1>then it falls away and it comes back </v>
<v Speaker 1>like three weeks later because I tour </v>

2451
01:49:26.161 --> 01:49:27.450
<v Speaker 1>for months at a time.</v>

2452
01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Like he does fiscal quarters go by and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have an opening act.</v>

2453
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You just go right on by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm by myself.</v>

2454
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:33.984
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes like in Australia they have a </v>

2455
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:38.070
<v Speaker 1>rule where if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people in your band,</v>

2456
01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 1>your american band than you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>australians have to play to.</v>

2457
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:42.123
<v Speaker 1>And I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a couple of times I've had a </v>

2458
01:49:44.011 --> 01:49:44.844
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good guy he opens for on some of </v>

2459
01:49:48.131 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 1>my bigger australian shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do it this last time,</v>

2460
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:52.024
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is bruce and he'll go do like </v>

2461
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes so we can say we did that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>

2462
01:49:56.351 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 1>So when I was going to Australia and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring american comedians to open for me,</v>

2463
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that well,</v>

2464
01:50:01.001 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 1>they just have this one to one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The canadians have it too,</v>

2465
01:50:03.581 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want a local band playing too,</v>

2466
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.530
<v Speaker 1>so you'll use lever canadian opener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2467
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 1>when I go to Canada too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring american comedians,</v>

2468
01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:11.633
<v Speaker 1>dope and I've done tours were that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make me have an opener who is </v>

2469
01:50:15.611 --> 01:50:20.611
<v Speaker 1>australian and I've done towards what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did was there last year in 2016,</v>

2470
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 1>like for a month of shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no opener.</v>

2471
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to be my buddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2472
01:50:24.971 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2473
01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:27.150
<v Speaker 1>no one does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I go,</v>

2474
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.280
<v Speaker 1>how am I doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not last time it was explained to me</v>

2475
01:50:30.281 --> 01:50:31.114
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't care that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't they have that canadian </v>

2476
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:34.144
<v Speaker 1>content rule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it comes to television right in </v>

2477
01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.860
<v Speaker 1>radio as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think canadians,</v>

2478
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>canadian content you have to have on the</v>

2479
01:50:42.941 --> 01:50:46.960
<v Speaker 1>radio and in television in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually I'm just on my own.</v>

2480
01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last one,</v>

2481
01:50:48.391 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 56 shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no openers.</v>

2482
01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you get lonely on the road?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2483
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:55.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that chip.</v>

2484
01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I used to get really anyone else again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got lonelier.</v>

2485
01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I got lonely when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:03.850
<v Speaker 1>he had a girlfriend or something and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda like a,</v>

2487
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 1>a lizard.</v>

2488
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.073
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2489
01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.430
<v Speaker 1>this lizard has had no one in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrarium for 80 years.</v>

2490
01:51:09.431 --> 01:51:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's still keeps eating bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm Henry Rollins and I still keep </v>

<v Speaker 1>She's dead now.</v>

2605
01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:04.463
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told that story about being on acid </v>

2606
01:56:06.931 --> 01:56:07.764
<v Speaker 1>and latina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably where I got it froM </v>

2607
01:56:08.690 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2608
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Other stories of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six acid trips.</v>

2609
01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.053
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you just decide to go </v>

2610
01:56:16.201 --> 01:56:17.950
<v Speaker 1>completely clean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2611
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I never really got started in my career </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a drug addict.</v>

2612
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noT even an avenue saying addict.</v>

2613
01:56:23.821 --> 01:56:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying someone uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

2614
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never.</v>

2615
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:27.623
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wired to such a in such a way that </v>

2616
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:35.330
<v Speaker 1>any stimulant is kind of a depressant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like beer and the times I drank,</v>

2617
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.081
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2618
01:56:37.081 --> 01:56:39.300
<v Speaker 1>for beers I'd throw up on my shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't good at it,</v>

2619
01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:40.493
<v Speaker 1>I didn't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did it because I wanted to hang </v>

2620
01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:43.280
<v Speaker 1>out with the gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>

2621
01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:46.230
<v Speaker 1>my dumb ass friends at school and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like it.</v>

2622
01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:47.063
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like the dizziness and it </v>

2623
01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:51.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't make me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just made me stupid.</v>

2624
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.823
<v Speaker 1>That time I smoked marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sat there waiting for it to be </v>

2625
01:56:54.901 --> 01:56:55.734
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat trying to figure out how to pick </v>

2626
01:56:57.691 --> 01:56:59.430
<v Speaker 1>up a glass of water is sitting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2627
01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:02.160
<v Speaker 1>how do I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all my,</v>

2628
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 1>my bandmates are experienced stones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2629
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you do that henry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2630
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.583
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you couldn't understand picking up a </v>

2631
01:57:09.271 --> 01:57:11.460
<v Speaker 1>glass of water when you went too deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

2632
01:57:11.461 --> 01:57:13.410
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does this last for?</v>

2633
01:57:13.411 --> 01:57:14.161
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20,</v>

2634
01:57:14.161 --> 01:57:15.090
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2635
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:15.924
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just sat and stared at my watch </v>

2636
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:19.080
<v Speaker 1>and waited it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acid was interesting.</v>

2637
01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Were you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2638
01:57:21.031 --> 01:57:21.864
<v Speaker 1>I could lose my mind so I just better </v>
<v Speaker 1>like concentrate so it doesn't run out </v>

2639
01:57:24.511 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 1>of my skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms are fun.</v>

2640
01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:30.480
<v Speaker 1>You laugh your ass off for three hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that wasn't so bad,</v>

2641
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't see anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

2642
01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same thing every time.</v>

2643
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.710
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of my entire history </v>
<v Speaker 1>with drug use.</v>

2644
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like caffeine,</v>

2645
01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:43.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

2646
01:57:43.621 --> 01:57:48.330
<v Speaker 1>but this I would drink like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a small cup of coffee.</v>

2647
01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:50.550
<v Speaker 1>This will last me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

2648
01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:53.670
<v Speaker 1>all day and one cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink a cup of day,</v>

2649
01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I make a cup of coffee and I just sip </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2650
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:56.813
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm thinking is that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicating with caffeine like an </v>

2651
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:00.204
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant and I use it as an iv </v>
<v Speaker 1>drip because I never drink cups of </v>

2652
01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:07.860
<v Speaker 1>coffee to start off hot and by the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day it's just this cold.</v>

2653
01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:08.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I sip it and I think it's just a </v>

2654
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:14.430
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ivy of caffeine and it must be because I</v>

2655
01:58:14.431 --> 01:58:17.490
<v Speaker 1>always have a cup of coffee with me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always half full,</v>

2656
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:18.900
<v Speaker 1>like on the weekends.</v>

2657
01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.513
<v Speaker 1>On the weekends if I'm off the road I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to coffee places to sit and write for </v>

2658
01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:24.264
<v Speaker 1>hours and work on book manuscripts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy the small coffee like this one </v>

2659
01:58:28.410 --> 01:58:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and three and a half hours later I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave and I'll just drop it in the trash</v>

2660
01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.230
<v Speaker 1>because it's still about three quarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>

2661
01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:37.240
<v Speaker 1>So I don't drink a lot of coffee in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wintertime.</v>

2662
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink a cup of tea in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a cup,</v>

2663
01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 1>a part of a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink all of the tea.</v>

2664
01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:44.430
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes what?</v>

2665
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:47.140
<v Speaker 1>What fuels you to be so prolific?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>

2666

2688
01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2689
01:59:58.151 --> 02:00:00.400

02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the people I was in bands</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2718
02:01:07.301 --> 02:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I have to crush them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone grew up with.</v>

2719
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I have to powderize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that's such a weird motivation is it</v>

2720
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's immature.</v>

2721
02:01:16.001 --> 02:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's 11 year old sandbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2722
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2723
02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.353
<v Speaker 1>That which makes it even stranger </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not something that you're </v>

2724
02:01:23.261 --> 02:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>just operating under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2725
02:01:24.731 --> 02:01:25.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

2726
02:01:25.241 --> 02:01:26.074
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's controlling you and you don't </v>

2727
02:01:27.281 --> 02:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>understand why I quite enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2728
02:01:31.210 --> 02:01:31.961
<v Speaker 1>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2729
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>parts on bike basically going in there </v>

2733
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm thinking like,</v>

2734
02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sony,</v>

<v Speaker 1>can't and I that informs everything I </v>

2741
02:02:02.721 --> 02:02:03.554
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like instead of just dialing my radio </v>

2744
02:02:09.411 --> 02:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Know that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This one and I make like three drafts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2746
02:02:12.801 --> 02:02:13.634
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I live </v>

2747
02:02:14.811 --> 02:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I work all the time like,</v>

2748
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out on this weekend,</v>

2749
02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>now it's 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM on a friday.</v>

2750
02:02:20.361 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm working like I'm not a constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2751
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fun to hang out with.</v>

2752
02:02:26.290 --> 02:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you vacation ever where you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>chill?</v>

2753
02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't intellectually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentially.</v>

2754
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation.</v>

2755
02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.093
<v Speaker 1>I make a joke on stage and saId I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come back 10 pounds lighter with an </v>

2756
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>internal parasite.</v>

2757
02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:39.483
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to come back with like a scar </v>

2758
02:02:41.301 --> 02:02:42.134
<v Speaker 1>where the spear kind of grazed me an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight grade stories and a dangerous </v>

2759
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:46.484
<v Speaker 1>insect in my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit on the beach and </v>

2760
02:02:48.981 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>soak in the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get sunburned by,</v>

2761
02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the desert and,</v>

2762
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:55.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how the sun won't try and </v>

2763
02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>kill me by noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sahara.</v>

2764
02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:00.463
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how I go about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of your motivation is actually </v>

2765
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the perception by other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>

2766
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:08.353
<v Speaker 1>like understanding that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is so undeniable the volume that </v>

2767
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you're putting out and the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intensity.</v>

2768
02:03:13.821 --> 02:03:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll show you motherfuckers.</v>

2769
02:03:16.611 --> 02:03:17.444
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2770
02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

2771
02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Even with people who like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2772
02:03:20.181 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 1>yay henry's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2773

2774
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pitch.</v>

2775
02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>So here's a place you won't go and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have any aggression towards these</v>

2776
02:03:28.911 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2777
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I just want to burn brightly and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not about money.</v>

2778
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than you because I,</v>

2779
02:03:36.501 --> 02:03:37.334
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to explode as much as </v>

2780
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think to my audience,</v>

2781
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>it's to their benefit.</v>

02:03:45.891 --> 02:03:48.170
<v Speaker 1>that dude's going to go out there to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place I don't want to go.</v>

2783
02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:49.004
<v Speaker 1>It is going to come back with 10 great </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos and a story about how he nearly </v>

2784
02:03:51.411 --> 02:03:52.940
<v Speaker 1>lost his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

2785
02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And like put me in coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the game I want to play.</v>

2786

<v Speaker 1>That's what I go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not trying to.</v>

02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the high school I was like,</v>

2797
02:04:21.981 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I was part of the test group and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get little orange tablets and then</v>

2798
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:30.980
<v Speaker 1>we get little yellow tablets and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangular orange tablets for awhile and</v>

2799
02:04:30.981 --> 02:04:31.814

2800
02:04:32.991 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>research center and I was a hyperactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid and they said,</v>

2801
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying this stuff out.</v>

2802
02:04:38.521 --> 02:04:43.521
<v Speaker 1>my mom had me on ritalin from preschool </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to twelfth grade.</v>

2803
02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the summertime,</v>

2804
02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>summer vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take it,</v>

2805
02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and within a day of this of kick and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>self out of your system,</v>

2806
02:04:52.021 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your appetite comes back and in ninth or</v>

2807
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:57.084
<v Speaker 1>10th grade I started weightlifting and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started like throwing the pills out </v>

2808
02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:01.073
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an app at that speed and so it </v>

2809
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>suppresses your appetite and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through puberty.</v>

2810
02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>My hormones are raging and I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the tablet and all of a sudden I'm</v>

<v Speaker 1>my frustration is now being informed by </v>

2817
02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:27.810

<v Speaker 1>went into the world just kind of wildly </v>

2822
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:48.240
<v Speaker 1>swinging away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a young age because it's what they were </v>

<v Speaker 1>doing in America with a lot of young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who talk too much or you know,</v>

02:06:06.361 --> 02:06:07.260
<v Speaker 1>he's doing this.</v>

2830
02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:08.093
<v Speaker 1>And I actually read a couple of teachers</v>
<v Speaker 1>reports about me years later and I said </v>

2831
02:06:11.101 --> 02:06:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I had no memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2832
02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I did all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom went,</v>

2833
02:06:13.981 --> 02:06:14.814
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they kicked you out and they </v>

2834
02:06:15.781 --> 02:06:18.240
<v Speaker 1>kicked you out of school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2835
02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:19.163
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of a few schools until </v>

2836
02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:22.043
<v Speaker 1>they put me in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a prep school where the advertising </v>

2837
02:06:25.441 --> 02:06:25.921
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2838
02:06:25.921 --> 02:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>your kid has problems with studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will cool them out.</v>

2839
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first few days of school,</v>

2840
02:06:31.891 --> 02:06:32.724
<v Speaker 1>some kids spoke at a class and I watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one teacher picked this kid up and </v>

2841
02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:36.810
<v Speaker 1>just kind of toss them into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackboard.</v>

2842
02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I went right in his class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shut up.</v>

2843
02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get,</v>

2844
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thrashing by a teacher,</v>

2845
02:06:43.651 --> 02:06:44.484
<v Speaker 1>so I was always really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having that difficulty sitting down </v>

2846
02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>and I was fine with topics I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know,</v>

2847
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:53.243
<v Speaker 1>I didn't groove on math or any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at lunchtime I'd go to the library </v>

2848
02:06:56.821 --> 02:06:57.654
<v Speaker 1>and start memorizing the latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>nomenclature of every north american </v>

2849
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn them all.</v>

2850
02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And by like 10th grade I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have,</v>

2851
02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:07.960
<v Speaker 1>most of it's still in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always,</v>

2852
02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:08.010
<v Speaker 1>always</v>

2853
02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:10.290
<v Speaker 3>very confused at these medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinctions.</v>

2854
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's adhd or hyperactive or add </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2855
02:07:16.210 --> 02:07:17.043
<v Speaker 3>Is is that real or do people just do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just have a different </v>

2856
02:07:20.701 --> 02:07:21.534
<v Speaker 3>composition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different passion inside of them and </v>

2857
02:07:23.791 --> 02:07:24.624
<v Speaker 3>they resist doing things they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do and they don't want to be a part </v>

2858
02:07:28.381 --> 02:07:31.350
<v Speaker 3>of any structured school curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of it.</v>

2859
02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:31.921
<v Speaker 3>But it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2860
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:35.190
<v Speaker 3>And is that a disease or is that or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have more fucking.</v>

2861
02:07:35.191 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>They're looking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If</v>

2862
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.840
<v Speaker 1>you have any pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not on anything.</v>

2863
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.501
<v Speaker 1>And yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Well his passion for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all this.</v>

2865
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the same shit that you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were six?</v>

2866
02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Just was undisciplined and unfocused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2867
02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a disease,</v>

2868
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:47.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2869
02:07:47.561 --> 02:07:48.394
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't call it a disease I </v>

2870
02:07:49.331 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>think is this wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2871
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>but why the fuck is it named?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it adh?</v>

2872
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can sell you a pill.</v>

2873
02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:56.073
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that crazy when you look back </v>

2874
02:07:57.551 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>at your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you were on that shit for.</v>

2875
02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many.</v>

2876
02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years,</v>

2877
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:04.474
<v Speaker 1>nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really screws with you because you </v>

2878
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:07.290
<v Speaker 1>can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take the t,</v>

2879
02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.710
<v Speaker 1>the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

2880
02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>You're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a propeller that spins so fast.</v>

2881
02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they're like spokes of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel wheel.</v>

2882
02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:17.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually going really fast.</v>

2883
02:08:18.070 --> 02:08:23.070
<v Speaker 1>That's how it felt like on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like this pale skinny like eh,</v>

2884
02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:24.933
<v Speaker 1>but inside I'm like the last few minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a dave in 2001 was coming into the </v>

2885
02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 1>space time continuum and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying by.</v>

2886
02:08:33.011 --> 02:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>that was lIke 10th grade for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2887
02:08:34.311 --> 02:08:35.144
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of held onto my desk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly flew through classes like not </v>

2888
02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:46.230
<v Speaker 1>being able to retain much because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeding my brains out and then the pill</v>

2889
02:08:46.391 --> 02:08:47.224
<v Speaker 1>would wear off around dinner and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you're like eating two meals </v>

2890
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:54.250
<v Speaker 1>and the next morning you take the pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't eat again for hours.</v>

2891
02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:55.293
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nuts and scares the shit out of </v>

2892
02:08:58.901 --> 02:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>me too because my parents didn't put me </v>
<v Speaker 1>on anything like that,</v>

2893
02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:05.350
<v Speaker 1>but I know I would've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I would've been diagnosed.</v>

2894
02:09:05.351 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I know I would have been put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something if I had the wrong parents.</v>

2895
02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put me on my.</v>

2896
02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:13.180
<v Speaker 1>My mom put me on this stuff probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my doctor said,</v>

2897
02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey iris,</v>

2898
02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:15.453
<v Speaker 1>this helps a lot of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in these classes and I'll </v>

2899
02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:21.970
<v Speaker 1>never forget one day I'm going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom's books.</v>

2900
02:09:21.971 --> 02:09:24.370
<v Speaker 1>There's just thIs big honking hardcover </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

2901
02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And I opened it up and I saw these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a contact sheet of me.</v>

2902
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2903
02:09:30.130 --> 02:09:30.963
<v Speaker 1>That set place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw the camera angle and I </v>

2904
02:09:33.821 --> 02:09:37.510
<v Speaker 1>realized there were these mirrors on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

2905
02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:41.050
<v Speaker 1>their observation rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget one day I'm looking at</v>

2906
02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:41.884
<v Speaker 1>that mirror and a door opened from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side and my mom walked out and they </v>

2907
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:46.264
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were being observed and the camera </v>

2908
02:09:48.011 --> 02:09:48.844
<v Speaker 1>angle was from that observation room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's me playing with blocks and </v>

2909
02:09:54.671 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2910
02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember that sweater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2911
02:09:57.521 --> 02:09:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like four.</v>

2912
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of that research </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

2913
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:01.833
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe because my mom was a </v>

2914
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:04.540
<v Speaker 1>government employee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2915
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.733
<v Speaker 1>but I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a place called it for two </v>

2916
02:10:07.631 --> 02:10:09.160
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the national research center.</v>

2917
02:10:09.161 --> 02:10:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I got thrown out of their wow for </v>
<v Speaker 1>wounding a kid,</v>

2918
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:14.920
<v Speaker 1>which due to them through a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>powdered.</v>

2919
02:10:14.921 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Submitted his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2920
02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:18.993
<v Speaker 1>Now when you started lifting weights </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were in twelfth grade and you </v>

2921
02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.370
<v Speaker 1>want more like a ninth or 10th?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninth and 10th.</v>

2922
02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early to when you stopped taking the </v>

2923
02:10:26.291 --> 02:10:27.124
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you feel like the exercise did for </v>

2924
02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you what the pills were kind of supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do for you?</v>

2925
02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:34.480
<v Speaker 1>The weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2926
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this coach,</v>

2927
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:37.703
<v Speaker 1>when he's mentioned in that article that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about the ira and I </v>

2928
02:10:40.581 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 1>talked to mr pepperman and he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in his car pool.</v>

2929
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He was a Vietnam vet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2930
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>he once said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2931
02:10:48.811 --> 02:10:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I have to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2932
02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:51.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a skinny little faggot.</v>

2933
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 1>She thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2934
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you how to lift </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>

2935
02:10:56.650 --> 02:10:57.321
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2936
02:10:57.321 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>it's more attention than my dad gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said I'll take it,</v>

2937
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and so he taught me compound lifts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the school gym,</v>

2938
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>so I bought a sears and roebuck sand </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled weight set,</v>

2939
02:11:05.631 --> 02:11:06.464
<v Speaker 1>which I couldn't drag too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom stays a vw fastback and </v>

2940
02:11:09.501 --> 02:11:12.450
<v Speaker 1>eventually I did a buy three months of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weight set.</v>

2941
02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm fairly throwing it across the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2942
02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:15.853
<v Speaker 1>you're growing so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your muscles are recovering </v>

2943
02:11:17.931 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do the same workout every day.</v>

2944
02:11:19.911 --> 02:11:20.744
<v Speaker 1>You don't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said you're not allowed to look </v>

2945
02:11:22.881 --> 02:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>at yourself until christmas break after </v>
<v Speaker 1>christmas exams.</v>

2946
02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And this was like in september.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't.</v>

2947
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:30.163
<v Speaker 1>I did everything he told me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he dropped me off before the </v>

2948
02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:33.860
<v Speaker 1>christmas break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2949
02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:35.840
<v Speaker 1>now today you can look at yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror.</v>

2950
02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:37.093
<v Speaker 1>And I ran home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran home and I tore my stupid school </v>

2951
02:11:40.341 --> 02:11:44.120
<v Speaker 1>uniform off and I stood in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my body had definition.</v>

2952
02:11:44.150 --> 02:11:44.983
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2953
02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:45.913
<v Speaker 1>those are packs of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I looked like I was a guy </v>

2954
02:11:47.481 --> 02:11:51.350
<v Speaker 1>who lifted some weights and I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was self valIdating.</v>

2955
02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

2956
02:11:52.970 --> 02:11:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at myself going,</v>

2957
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I did that no one can lift those weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2958
02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And the feeling of achievement it gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2959
02:12:00.590 --> 02:12:05.590
<v Speaker 1>that I accomplished that was a shot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arm that I still feel to this day,</v>

2960
02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:08.840
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it was so like,</v>

2961
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

2962
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.323
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every other time I'm trying to </v>

2963
02:12:13.371 --> 02:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>meet girls at the school dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no guts to talk to the girls.</v>

2964
02:12:16.511 --> 02:12:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So they were alien creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2965
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do well in school so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make fun of me.</v>

2966
02:12:21.021 --> 02:12:21.854
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't throw the ball straight so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would throw it at my head to watch </v>

2967
02:12:24.081 --> 02:12:25.730
<v Speaker 1>me run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

2968
02:12:25.731 --> 02:12:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't have any traction anywhere.</v>

2969
02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And then when I had the weights I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2970
02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:33.650
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm filling out my tee shirt,</v>

2971
02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noticeable improvement.</v>

2972
02:12:35.031 --> 02:12:35.864
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus effort equals results and I </v>

2973
02:12:39.171 --> 02:12:41.340
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make my grades better.</v>

2974
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:42.021
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2975
02:12:42.021 --> 02:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>is all of swahili to me is a school of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

2976
02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>It was probably too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2977
02:12:46.911 --> 02:12:48.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not good at sitting still,</v>

2978
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.540
<v Speaker 1>but when I had the summer jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I kicked ass.</v>

2979
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I never had an allowance.</v>

2980
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom said,</v>

2981
02:12:56.631 --> 02:12:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you never said here's 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2982
02:12:58.161 --> 02:12:58.851
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry go.</v>

2983
02:12:58.851 --> 02:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>He's got three jobs over the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up in the morning,</v>

2984
02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.710
<v Speaker 1>go to the pet shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work all day.</v>

2985
02:13:03.711 --> 02:13:05.540
<v Speaker 1>They're run home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

2986
02:13:05.541 --> 02:13:07.970
<v Speaker 1>change my clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the night shift at the movie theater,</v>

2987
02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.610
<v Speaker 1>take the bus out to the surf shop In the</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburbs and,</v>

2988
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.490
<v Speaker 1>and repair skateboards and whatever on </v>
<v Speaker 1>sundays.</v>

2989
02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So I always had pocket money because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

2990
02:13:16.041 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I liked having working a cash register </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my key chain in school.</v>

2991
02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:21.014
<v Speaker 1>I had the keys to stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses trusted me because I'd never </v>

2992
02:13:23.751 --> 02:13:24.584
<v Speaker 1>steal and I so I would work like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a week and go to school in high </v>

2993
02:13:31.351 --> 02:13:36.351
<v Speaker 1>school and part of that was informed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weightlifting and I like getting out</v>

2994
02:13:36.871 --> 02:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>of the house and being responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in school it didn't mean much to me,</v>

2995
02:13:40.501 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but showing up on time at the pet shop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cleaning out 20 cat pans.</v>

2996
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like I had to be there at 8:00,</v>

2997
02:13:48.031 --> 02:13:49.230
<v Speaker 1>not eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh one man.</v>

2998
02:13:49.530 --> 02:13:54.030
<v Speaker 1>because we got thIngs to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt a real fealty and to this day,</v>

2999
02:13:54.031 --> 02:13:54.864
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm ever on a film shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who's the guy who's there early </v>

3000
02:13:56.821 --> 02:13:57.511
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

3001
02:13:57.511 --> 02:13:58.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm there.</v>

3002
02:13:58.291 --> 02:14:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I memorized the whole damn script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy to have a job.</v>

3003
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm like amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone cares.</v>

3004
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:04.343
<v Speaker 1>And so all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps me on the straight and narrow </v>

3005
02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>as I call myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human frozen yogurt machine is output.</v>

3006
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the applause.</v>

3007
02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to build ships.</v>

3008
02:14:15.691 --> 02:14:16.524
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best part about finishing the </v>

3009
02:14:18.831 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 1>ship is it sales off to see and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>build another.</v>

3010
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:25.050
<v Speaker 1>so I love finishing a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll get this thing off my desktop.</v>

3011
02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I can start a new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where can I go now?</v>

3012
02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live to achieve and to output,</v>

3013
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever look at.</v>

3014
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:37.223
<v Speaker 1>I hAve a thing on my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the list and I keep a list </v>

3015
02:14:40.471 --> 02:14:43.260
<v Speaker 1>of like every show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every book I've written,</v>

3016
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:45.390
<v Speaker 1>every movie I've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every album I've ever made.</v>

3017
02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intense.</v>

3018
02:14:47.971 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like you keep a list of every show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever done.</v>

3019
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:51.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell yeah,</v>

3020

<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3021
02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody who does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:14:55.531 --> 02:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I write down a set length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3023
02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>take a lot of notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3024
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:01.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write them all down.</v>

3025
02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.513
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this one thing called the list </v>

3026
02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:04.770
<v Speaker 1>and It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3027
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:06.030
<v Speaker 1>every film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every tv show,</v>

3028

<v Speaker 1>on and on.</v>

3030
02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:12.053
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I look at it just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to input like the new book comes </v>

3031
02:15:14.281 --> 02:15:15.114
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to the thing and input and </v>

3032
02:15:15.901 --> 02:15:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I look at this list and my bone start </v>
<v Speaker 1>aching.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like leaving a good trail of evidence </v>

<v Speaker 1>list.</v>

3058
02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:13.620

<v Speaker 1>just so people could look at it.</v>

3059
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like that will change the way </v>

3064
02:16:26.341 --> 02:16:27.174
<v Speaker 1>a person looks at the world to know that</v>

3072
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:43.204
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that I like when I </v>

3073
02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:49.240
<v Speaker 3>talked to people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated and really passionate it,</v>

3074

02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3077
02:16:54.931 --> 02:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>that's all you get to do In life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to do stuff and then you die.</v>

3078
02:16:58.730 --> 02:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over and it's over fast enough.</v>

3079
02:17:01.161 --> 02:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

3080
02:17:02.751 --> 02:17:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't tell people what this is a very</v>

3081
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:07.710
<v Speaker 3>compelling and attractive attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have those.</v>

3082
02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

3083
02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps me going and it never gets.</v>

3084
02:17:12.030 --> 02:17:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I never get to that point where I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to enough places where I've written</v>

3085
02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:20.400
<v Speaker 1>enough books or have done enough radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows or I bought enough records.</v>

3086
02:17:20.401 --> 02:17:21.234
<v Speaker 1>There's never enough records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never enough time to do </v>

3087
02:17:23.791 --> 02:17:27.090
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like living with that kind of,</v>

3088
02:17:27.091 --> 02:17:27.924
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of desperation where you're </v>

3089
02:17:30.811 --> 02:17:31.621
<v Speaker 1>always kInd of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3090
02:17:31.621 --> 02:17:32.700
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

3091
02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked that because it keeps the,</v>

3092
02:17:35.490 --> 02:17:36.323
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps the blood thin and it keeps </v>

3093
02:17:38.281 --> 02:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>complacency at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3094
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I have my bad days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3095
02:17:42.571 --> 02:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>anyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a,</v>

3096
02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an example.</v>

3097
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

3098
02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:48.210
<v Speaker 3>your bad days would probably ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're burning so hot.</v>

3099
02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bad days.</v>

3100
02:17:49.291 --> 02:17:52.500
<v Speaker 3>It probably like an average ambitious </v>
<v Speaker 3>person's quality time.</v>

3101
02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3102
02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3103
02:17:54.390 --> 02:17:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the reasons why I picked</v>

3104
02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the people I work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like today you met heidi who manages not</v>

3105
02:18:02.771 --> 02:18:06.850
<v Speaker 1>only me but all my companies and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

3106
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:07.773
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she and I had been working together for </v>

3107
02:18:08.621 --> 02:18:09.454
<v Speaker 1>damn near 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's amazing and she's air traffic </v>

3108
02:18:12.641 --> 02:18:14.800
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I'm not,</v>

3109
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:15.634
<v Speaker 1>I've never careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say yes to every damn thing and she's </v>

3110
02:18:17.671 --> 02:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say yes to that because you're</v>

3111
02:18:19.031 --> 02:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>going to be over here on this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

3112
02:18:20.890 --> 02:18:22.600
<v Speaker 1>stop answering the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

3113
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:23.583
<v Speaker 1>So she like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the one who coordinated all this </v>

3114
02:18:25.691 --> 02:18:27.490
<v Speaker 1>with you because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3115
02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll go and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not good at setting it up.</v>

3116
02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:32.223
<v Speaker 1>And so she locks in the coordinates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I work with people who are used </v>

3117
02:18:36.521 --> 02:18:41.521
<v Speaker 1>to kind of my velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the road manager in a way.</v>

3118
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm very easy on road manager ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

3119
02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:46.083
<v Speaker 1>I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the front of the bus and he's </v>

3120
02:18:47.351 --> 02:18:50.050
<v Speaker 1>already written out the map for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk to a gym.</v>

3121
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:51.033
<v Speaker 1>So I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go right to the gym and I always want </v>

3122
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to jim,</v>

3123
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I want this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a gig.</v>

3124
02:18:55.991 --> 02:18:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And then I want some sushi and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep and so,</v>

3125
02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:00.543
<v Speaker 1>but it's intense and there's hardly any </v>
<v Speaker 1>days off so he knows how to keep all of </v>

3126
02:19:05.561 --> 02:19:06.394
<v Speaker 1>that going and the phone is ringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I work in different media all </v>

3127
02:19:09.551 --> 02:19:10.384
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so heidi is always juggling a chain </v>

3128
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:17.190
<v Speaker 1>saws and so I'm around people who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me just to really run at it and go</v>

3129
02:19:20.141 --> 02:19:23.740
<v Speaker 1>as fast and as hard as I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it living at the speed of life.</v>

3130
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:28.610
<v Speaker 1>He just kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let your Imagination in your resolve</v>

3131
02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:33.940
<v Speaker 1>dictate everything and to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and still keep the lights on.</v>

3132
02:19:35.090 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a lucky bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

3133
02:19:37.701 --> 02:19:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I try and be really cool about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this humility is very contagIous</v>

3134
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice.</v>

3135
02:19:42.711 --> 02:19:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice to hear that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this attitude in our line of work.</v>

3136
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everything about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3137
02:19:48.831 --> 02:19:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you and I do enough for the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

3138
02:19:51.681 --> 02:19:52.514
<v Speaker 1>we get in free to stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doors open stuff that other people pay </v>

3139
02:19:56.181 --> 02:19:57.014
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just give you a tour of a man </v>

3140
02:19:57.771 --> 02:19:58.604
<v Speaker 1>because they disliked the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>came by and so the only way not to be a </v>

3141
02:20:03.411 --> 02:20:04.244
<v Speaker 1>jerk wIth all of that is to don't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too seriously and to be as grateful </v>

3142
02:20:09.681 --> 02:20:10.514
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

3143
02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several minutes ago I said I've met,</v>

3144

3146
02:20:17.781 --> 02:20:18.614

<v Speaker 1>know they are just lucky bastards and </v>

<v Speaker 1>all like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3148

3149
02:20:23.781 --> 02:20:26.670

<v Speaker 1>like the most humble know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're just so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a gig and it's going pretty </v>

3151
02:20:29.781 --> 02:20:33.350
<v Speaker 1>well and they just know that they beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grind.</v>

3152
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:35.510
<v Speaker 1>They obviously had something to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3153
02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.210
<v Speaker 1>they had something that the world says </v>
<v Speaker 1>wow about,</v>

3154
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:39.523
<v Speaker 1>but they also at the same time know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to take the same </v>

3155
02:20:42.610 --> 02:20:43.443
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of really good people who </v>

3156
02:20:45.231 --> 02:20:48.290
<v Speaker 1>don't deserve it or going to take what </v>
<v Speaker 1>boot koski wrote about.</v>

3157
02:20:48.291 --> 02:20:48.681
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>looking to escape any beatings,</v>

3160
02:20:57.290 --> 02:21:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but to have an Idea and get to do it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it into something that kind of pays</v>

02:21:03.261 --> 02:21:06.560
<v Speaker 1>me like I can go into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has these crazy things happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably living in a pocket.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A little bit of department now I got a </v>

3171
02:21:30.051 --> 02:21:30.630
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you need some room.</v>

3174
02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3175
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:36.623
<v Speaker 1>I spend money on records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane tickets and the occasional lens </v>

3176
02:21:40.251 --> 02:21:41.810
<v Speaker 1>for a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3177
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but by and large costs a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3178
02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I drive a mazda six watts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you do that on purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in la,</v>

3180
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:52.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you fly economy,</v>

3181
02:21:52.251 --> 02:21:53.084
<v Speaker 1>you one of those motherfuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have over a million miles on united </v>

3182
02:21:56.781 --> 02:21:58.760
<v Speaker 1>and I probably tried to upgrade you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3183
02:21:58.761 --> 02:21:58.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3184
02:21:58.991 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3185
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:00.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3186
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:01.040
<v Speaker 1>The ilc?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3187
02:22:01.090 --> 02:22:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I save them up for when I go on tour.</v>

3188
02:22:03.861 --> 02:22:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Like last year I was in Australia twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's where I use the miles.</v>

3189
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:11.720
<v Speaker 1>But Australia economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>

3190
02:22:11.721 --> 02:22:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I upgraded into business because I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already saved up the miles,</v>

3191
02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but usually I fly economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3192
02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.313
<v Speaker 1>Why do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I will not justify spending </v>

3193
02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:21.733
<v Speaker 1>$2,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for more leg room for seven hours </v>

3194
02:22:23.421 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>because you can buy like a truckload of </v>
<v Speaker 1>records of that money.</v>

3195
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you already have that $2,000</v>

3196
02:22:28.261 --> 02:22:30.690
<v Speaker 1>in the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need that $2,000.</v>

3197
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I was really broke ass in a band for </v>
<v Speaker 1>many years and the,</v>

3198
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:40.550
<v Speaker 1>all the money I made it came with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sweat and a lot of pain and I,</v>

3199
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:41.443
<v Speaker 1>I must respect it and to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying to put yourself in </v>

3200
02:22:45.541 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 1>business classes being disrespectful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

3201
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:52.020
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is I can't justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I simply cannot go.</v>

3202
02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:54.240
<v Speaker 1>That was worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

3203
02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many records do you think you have?</v>

3204
02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like triples.</v>

3205
02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Mandate is keep showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>five lps in five singles.</v>

3207
02:23:05.671 --> 02:23:09.000
<v Speaker 1>And when you sit down and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>records or is this a solitary pursuit?</v>

3208
02:23:09.310 --> 02:23:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Just headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3281
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:10.510
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to both nights because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love both bands.</v>

3282
02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's a gig in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

3283
02:26:12.551 --> 02:26:14.380
<v Speaker 1>if they play in two nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go both nights.</v>

3284
02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:19.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're still deeply involved in music</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as far as you being a fan.</v>

3285
02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:20.393
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just don't have the desire to </v>

3286
02:26:22.301 --> 02:26:23.280
<v Speaker 1>perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3287
02:26:23.310 --> 02:26:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3288
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:24.783
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came into music being a fan and I </v>

3289
02:26:26.921 --> 02:26:27.471
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3290
02:26:27.471 --> 02:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I will always be a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3291
02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3292
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.293
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a drag when you meet a musician </v>

3293
02:26:32.471 --> 02:26:34.190
<v Speaker 1>who's not a fan of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3294
02:26:34.191 --> 02:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

3295
02:26:35.151 --> 02:26:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3296
02:26:36.461 --> 02:26:38.260
<v Speaker 1>these bands all suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could really don't.</v>

3297
02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way about comedians that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't a fan of standup.</v>

3298
02:26:40.810 --> 02:26:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I love standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still loves,</v>

3299
02:26:42.421 --> 02:26:43.670
<v Speaker 1>stand up and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3300
02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose somewhere along the line sometimes.</v>

3301
02:26:47.971 --> 02:26:48.804
<v Speaker 1>Some of them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad when I go to gigs all </v>

3302
02:26:50.621 --> 02:26:53.380
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

3303
02:26:53.381 --> 02:26:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's also sad a lot of times these </v>
<v Speaker 1>bands,</v>

3304
02:26:55.871 --> 02:26:57.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>BecAuse I play them on my radio show.</v>

02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:29.053
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus christ was more what I'm getting </v>

3346
02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:31.334
<v Speaker 1>involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized I can't hack it because </v>

3347
02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:36.890
<v Speaker 1>here's the awful thing about being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult in a relationship,</v>

3348
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:39.410
<v Speaker 1>seeking to be an adult in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

3349
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I have found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3350
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.520
<v Speaker 1>when I was young and I was a boy and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dating girls,</v>

3351
02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it's boys and girls and she's an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an idiot,</v>

3352
02:28:46.390 --> 02:28:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you do dumb things and if cheats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3353
02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:52.850
<v Speaker 1>then you hit a certain part of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she's a woman and you're a man and</v>

3354
02:28:52.851 --> 02:28:53.684
<v Speaker 1>you have adult expectations and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be running around being an idiot </v>

3355
02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.593
<v Speaker 1>with someone who kind of wants you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the table because they are sincerely </v>

3356
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:07.640
<v Speaker 1>giving time of their adult life to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you were doing together.</v>

3357
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:08.743
<v Speaker 1>And when you come in still thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in ninth grade and she's coming </v>

3358
02:29:11.631 --> 02:29:12.464
<v Speaker 1>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is part of what my life is being </v>

3359
02:29:16.851 --> 02:29:21.851
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never been able to answer that in</v>

3360
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>a mature enough way to where I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been able to maintain it.</v>

3361
02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Because like say next weekend if I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

3362
02:29:30.981 --> 02:29:32.780
<v Speaker 1>she might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's friday.</v>

3363
02:29:32.781 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3364
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:36.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching me write for four hours,</v>

3365
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and so that's not the way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

3366
02:29:40.270 --> 02:29:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't be a good persons other </v>
<v Speaker 1>half because I'm always,</v>

3367
02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the work has always attracted me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than coming home to someone.</v>

3368
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:51.283
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't stand the idea of someone </v>

3369
02:29:53.770 --> 02:29:54.603
<v Speaker 1>of living with a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do it on the bus because it's das </v>

3370
02:29:57.381 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 1>boat and work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3371
02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:00.560
<v Speaker 1>going down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3372
02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:01.873
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never would want to like wake up and </v>

3373
02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:08.000
<v Speaker 1>she's there and I have no aversion.</v>

3374
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Get expressed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look to your right.</v>

3375
02:30:13.950 --> 02:30:15.080
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3376
02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it's every day here we are together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not wired that way.</v>

3377
02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I would be a drag like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't spoken to me in 20 hours.</v>

3378
02:30:24.530 --> 02:30:25.363
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't notice and I'm just a work </v>

3379
02:30:28.101 --> 02:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>oriented and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3380
02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in wasting anyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3381
02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not into it.</v>

3382
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:37.003
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman was hitting on me a while ago </v>

3383
02:30:41.631 --> 02:30:42.464
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ma'am,</v>

3384
02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I call her ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

3385
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:48.620
<v Speaker 1>She was very persistent and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ma'am,</v>

3386
02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a hunting dog.</v>

3387
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not the kind you pat,</v>

3388
02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:56.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not,</v>

3389
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:59.390

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

3390
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:02.030
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should stop this.</v>

3391
02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:05.760
<v Speaker 1>She's imagining holding your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to your spoken word shows,</v>

3392
02:31:05.761 --> 02:31:09.590
<v Speaker 1>going and going to dinner with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about your day and um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't write me.</v>

3411
02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:04.670
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm contentedly just working away and so</v>

<v Speaker 1>What gives you happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation and it's kind of a </v>

3419
02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 1>replicant vulcan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3420
02:32:27.661 --> 02:32:28.494
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans don't have play a large part in </v>

3421
02:32:31.351 --> 02:32:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need to go hang out with my</v>

3422
02:32:33.181 --> 02:32:35.910
<v Speaker 1>friends on the weekend and hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't call him man.</v>

3423
02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:36.990
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3424
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:37.800
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't call.</v>

3425
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:38.633
<v Speaker 1>But you do appreciate those humans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to see you perform and you feel a </v>

3426
02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:43.050
<v Speaker 1>deep obligation to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3427
02:32:43.051 --> 02:32:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I serve them and I love.</v>

3428
02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I like servitude.</v>

3429
02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I like wanting to give them something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3430
02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I make the best hash I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I sling it with everything I've</v>

3431
02:32:53.131 --> 02:32:53.964
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to hang around </v>

3432
02:32:55.290 --> 02:32:58.290
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has to do it.</v>

3433
02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.930
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could just say thank you,</v>

3434
02:33:00.931 --> 02:33:02.910
<v Speaker 1>goodnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk out of the building and do a moving</v>

3435
02:33:02.911 --> 02:33:06.180
<v Speaker 1>vehicle and be 10 blocks down the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they get up out of their seats.</v>

3436
02:33:06.181 --> 02:33:07.770
<v Speaker 1>That would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3437
02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else there is to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>except hit it and then quit it.</v>

3438
02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:14.093
<v Speaker 1>And so it makes some interactions a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little uncomfortable and that I liked </v>

3439
02:33:18.991 --> 02:33:19.824
<v Speaker 1>these people write a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea how much I just want </v>

3440
02:33:24.071 --> 02:33:26.940
<v Speaker 1>to just rock their world with like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book or a show.</v>

3441
02:33:27.450 --> 02:33:30.030
<v Speaker 1>But beyond that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3442
02:33:30.031 --> 02:33:31.170
<v Speaker 1>come and hang out with us on it.</v>

3443
02:33:31.650 --> 02:33:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do get appreciation from hanging</v>

3444
02:33:34.591 --> 02:33:36.470
<v Speaker 1>out with people that you meet when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on your journeys.</v>

3445
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3446
02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:39.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet someone on the road,</v>

3447
02:33:39.570 --> 02:33:41.610
<v Speaker 1>like some guy in his village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3448
02:33:41.611 --> 02:33:42.460
<v Speaker 1>so man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's your,</v>

3449
02:33:42.510 --> 02:33:43.620
<v Speaker 1>what's your day like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3450
02:33:43.621 --> 02:33:44.670
<v Speaker 1>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3451
02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Where you get your water from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me that.</v>

3452
02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:47.673
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you differentiate them because </v>

3453
02:33:48.481 --> 02:33:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they're so unusual and their life is so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3454
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it's information extraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

3455
02:33:53.101 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know that person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

3456
02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:56.603
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel that connection to </v>

3457
02:33:58.771 --> 02:34:01.080
<v Speaker 1>someone that you meet in real life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

3458
02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I meet them and I'm polite is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit.</v>

3459
02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to like hang out and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend all the time.</v>

3460
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it.</v>

3461
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:16.743
<v Speaker 1>The same expression she's there and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not trying to be a jerk just doesn't </v>

3462
02:34:24.101 --> 02:34:26.060
<v Speaker 1>compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so instead of like,</v>

3463
02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:27.910
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to go down to the park,</v>

3464
02:34:27.911 --> 02:34:28.541
<v Speaker 1>come with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3465
02:34:28.541 --> 02:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>well how about I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just make you a really good book and,</v>

3466
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:34.503
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3467
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll price it as cheaply as I can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just let that be okay.</v>

3468
02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:40.173
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about I'll just email you and say I </v>

3469
02:34:41.951 --> 02:34:42.784
<v Speaker 1>hope you're having a good day and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just let it go and you don't seem to </v>

3470
02:34:46.811 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>have any problem with anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

3471
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:51.700
<v Speaker 1>like there's not like some things you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to resolve or work through.</v>

3472
02:34:51.701 --> 02:34:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what you found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing you found this way.</v>

3473
02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:58.570
<v Speaker 1>This is my groove and I come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington dc and I love that.</v>

3474
02:34:58.571 --> 02:34:59.404
<v Speaker 1>I love that city and I go there every </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in awhile to visit and some nights </v>

3475
02:35:02.651 --> 02:35:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I visit with my good pal ian of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some nights I just want a mom my own</v>

3476
02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:08.073
<v Speaker 1>and I walked all my old jobs and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked by apartment buildings I lived </v>

3477
02:35:11.621 --> 02:35:12.454
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I walked by people's houses who </v>

3478
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:16.210
<v Speaker 1>people who grew up with these amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>

3479
02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:17.043
<v Speaker 1>They all became big musicians and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in there sometimes I can even </v>

3480
02:35:20.801 --> 02:35:24.190
<v Speaker 1>see him in the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go in.</v>

3481
02:35:24.250 --> 02:35:25.083
<v Speaker 1>I just like walking by their place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing they're in there and like </v>

3482
02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:31.630
<v Speaker 1>literally I walked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen someone I grew up with like on</v>

3483
02:35:31.631 --> 02:35:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the street and I go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3484
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:35.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well henry,</v>

3485
02:35:35.201 --> 02:35:36.910
<v Speaker 1>why don't you run up and tap on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and say,</v>

3486
02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:38.410
<v Speaker 1>hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3487
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I just liked the fact that I just saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>him walking.</v>

3488
02:35:40.751 --> 02:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's all I need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3489
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:46.690
<v Speaker 1>it's weird and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been like that since I can remember</v>

3490
02:35:46.990 --> 02:35:50.350
<v Speaker 1>and it gets more like that the older I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

3491
02:35:50.590 --> 02:35:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make sense because as you get</v>

3492
02:35:52.361 --> 02:35:54.610
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more rigid in your ways and your,</v>

3493
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your groove is cut deeper and deeper and</v>

3494
02:35:58.600 --> 02:35:59.433
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this stuff I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a bloody long time to finish </v>

3495
02:36:01.871 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3496
02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:02.793
<v Speaker 1>You want to write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you better get ready for the long </v>

3497
02:36:04.991 --> 02:36:08.290
<v Speaker 1>haul because you'll be working on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucker two years later and you know,</v>

3498
02:36:08.291 --> 02:36:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it just never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like editing revisions in the tours.</v>

3499
02:36:12.851 --> 02:36:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like two weeks.</v>

3500
02:36:14.201 --> 02:36:15.034
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like 13 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll see you next year that you do </v>

3501
02:36:19.151 --> 02:36:20.760
<v Speaker 1>that and then you take time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3502
02:36:20.761 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 1>You didn't let go the long stretch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take time away from the tour.</v>

3503
02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only reason is if I had my way,</v>

3504
02:36:26.201 --> 02:36:27.034
<v Speaker 1>I'd be on the road every year and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>have hours of new material and no one </v>

3505
02:36:29.781 --> 02:36:30.614
<v Speaker 1>would ever get tired of me coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their city once a year and I used to </v>

3506
02:36:32.831 --> 02:36:33.664
<v Speaker 1>tour like that for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes out every year and people are </v>

3507
02:36:36.071 --> 02:36:36.551
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>henry,</v>

3508
02:36:36.551 --> 02:36:38.290
<v Speaker 1>we love you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to start coming here.</v>

3509
02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Less often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a little offensive,</v>

3510
02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but he just keeps going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3511
02:36:41.651 --> 02:36:42.484
<v Speaker 1>it's me again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I started doing it every </v>

3512
02:36:44.291 --> 02:36:45.124
<v Speaker 1>other year and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my promoter types who are happy to take </v>

3513
02:36:48.251 --> 02:36:49.360
<v Speaker 1>their 15 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

3514
02:36:49.361 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 1>henry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love you man,</v>

3515
02:36:50.321 --> 02:36:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

3516
02:36:51.970 --> 02:36:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So often people just getting a little up</v>

3517
02:36:54.701 --> 02:36:56.920
<v Speaker 1>to here with it even every other year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3518
02:36:57.310 --> 02:36:58.143
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but spoken word and so I would think </v>

3519
02:37:00.521 --> 02:37:02.590
<v Speaker 1>that that would be enough time for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3520
02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:03.873
<v Speaker 1>I wish it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I did what everyone told me to </v>

3521
02:37:06.341 --> 02:37:07.174
<v Speaker 1>this time around because I know these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are all smarter than me and they </v>

3522
02:37:09.791 --> 02:37:12.160
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you wait a little while longer?</v>

3523
02:37:12.370 --> 02:37:16.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the last big tour is 2012 and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went out again in 2016.</v>

3524
02:37:16.881 --> 02:37:20.420
<v Speaker 1>That was four years basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from one presidential election to</v>

3525
02:37:20.421 --> 02:37:21.254
<v Speaker 1>another and the ticket sales spiked </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere was like london was like </v>

3526
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:31.100
<v Speaker 1>$1,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tickets than I've ever done there.</v>

3527
02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:33.830
<v Speaker 1>I sold out two nights at the sydney </v>
<v Speaker 1>opera house in sydney.</v>

3528
02:37:34.100 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3529
02:37:35.481 --> 02:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>what's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that you waited,</v>

3530
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:39.790
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave people a time to,</v>

3531
02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:40.673
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to forget how long you talk for them </v>

3532
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:45.423
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's sad to think that I have to </v>

3533
02:37:48.231 --> 02:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>wait until 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

3534
02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but I can do little weekend here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weekend there,</v>

3535
02:37:53.271 --> 02:37:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but I can't go do the lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did next year.</v>

3536
02:37:56.090 --> 02:37:57.320
<v Speaker 1>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you want to.</v>

3537
02:37:57.410 --> 02:38:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3538
02:38:00.730 --> 02:38:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being on stage.</v>

3539
02:38:02.001 --> 02:38:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I love being in front of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like giving.</v>

3540
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:06.743
<v Speaker 1>I guess getting is the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when people applaud at the end of </v>

3541
02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:11.191
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get nervous.</v>

3542
02:38:11.191 --> 02:38:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I just want to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand there like one,</v>

3543
02:38:13.711 --> 02:38:15.300
<v Speaker 1>1002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1003,</v>

3544
