00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I have to sit back and all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to think for myself that</v>

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I love my library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have all the books within it.</v>

5
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I love the cars that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the relationships that I have,</v>

6
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>but there's a give her instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

7
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but just the things and it's like these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all great things,</v>

8
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but if I don't have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am still me.</v>

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I still have everything that I need in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to think about them being</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>

11
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly hate the idea of it being</v>

12
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>destroyed because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't in my hands.</v>

13
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd like them to still exist for others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without them.</v>

14
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm no different than who I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's kind of a thinking of</v>

15
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>like the Stoics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you've been more defined by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments and your thinking and</v>

17
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>your philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things that people,</v>

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>obviously they couldn't know about me.</v>

19
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.543
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

20
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's not the kind of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

21
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>is just my who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And I don't need someone to know whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not I'm smart or whether or not I</v>

23
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>know this or whether or not I can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

24
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'll do it when I need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I,</v>

25
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I have to try and look to see that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have my own inner peace is based on my</v>

26
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>own self knowledge and knowledge also</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I am lacking,</v>

27
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>that I can be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

28
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and if I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can choose to.</v>

29
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And those days that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a choice not to be better.</v>

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that I couldn't because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and failing like we talked about</v>

31
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>before is a worthwhile endeavor because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will move you towards either a</v>

32
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>eventually getting there or b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not something that's going to</v>

33
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>be yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what it is and you know</v>

34
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different perspective</v>

35
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>altogether and</v>

36
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

37
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>that is where I feel like that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be okay in this world and deal in,</v>

38
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of things that you can</v>

39
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>draw your focus and really eat at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bother you and you're giving weight</v>

40
00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>to these things and allowing them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an effect on you and that's</v>

41
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a normal thing and it's easy to</v>

42
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can be okay with all right,</v>

43
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>if all I'm left with is just me and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

44
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>if I no longer have anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

45
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>no more luxuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more this,</v>

46
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>no more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you be okay with that?</v>

47
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of life would you make of</v>

48
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like to think the same one I have</v>

49
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can pick me up here,</v>

50
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 1>take all my shit away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw me some other part of the world,</v>

51
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 1>the third world country and it will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>jarring.</v>

52
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>It will be difficult and there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some lament of course,</v>

53
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>but I will continue to be who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will see what is necessary to,</v>

54
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with others and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to propagate this that I'm</v>

55
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>trying to create in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

56
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did of the new,</v>

57
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been a place where it felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird?</v>

58
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>We found out that someone died there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been in a place where you felt</v>

59
00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the presence of it in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That felt weird</v>

60
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.730
<v Speaker 3>because you know some violence was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pop off and I knew it,</v>

61
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

62
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get the fuck outta here.</v>

63
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you can tell,</v>

64
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you can feel that somebody's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

65
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 3>I was at a concert once in a brawl broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and I quit.</v>

66
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:16.560
<v Speaker 3>I was a security guard and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a neil young concert and it broke</v>

67
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:19.350
<v Speaker 3>out and I put a Hoodie on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I zipped it up and covered my security</v>

68
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 3>outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd walk right the fuck out of there.</v>

69
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out of your fucking mind,</v>

70
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 3>jumping into this fray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting clocked in the head by somebody.</v>

71
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Like people were fighting and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

72
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 3>They canceled the show and kicked</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody out.</v>

73
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 3>People are lighting fires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a,</v>

74
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not this odd vibe awards when when</v>

75
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Dr Dre got jumped at it and a young buck</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabbed a guy.</v>

76
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

78
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.730

<v Speaker 3>and a one of the execs from upn was</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

103
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I know the energy in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel it.</v>

104
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I've been around it too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy feeling to when people</v>

105
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 3>are about to do something with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 3>You see them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see them walk,</v>

107
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you see the look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

108
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sad,</v>

109
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you grow up in the hood,</v>

110
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you have that instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have that,</v>

111
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 3>that look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at a guy walked past,</v>

112
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 3>you would one time and you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look around the room and okay,</v>

113
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 3>it's about to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about to go.</v>

114
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.080
<v Speaker 3>People that have never experienced that</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably wouldn't know what to do.</v>

115
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't,</v>

116

200
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 5>a card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he went in and got it for me and it</v>

<v Speaker 5>was this lemon bar that said award</v>
<v Speaker 5>winning on it.</v>

202
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 5>And me being the weed novice,</v>

203
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.270
<v Speaker 5>oh this is going to be award winning</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the taste.</v>

204
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:29.104
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

205
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.470
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like a Paula deen recipe.</v>

206
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.500
<v Speaker 5>And so</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ate like half of it and I was by</v>

207
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 5>myself and I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was laying down and I was in my bed</v>

208
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:44.800
<v Speaker 5>and I sat up and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I talking to myself?</v>

209
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm not talking to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have to check.</v>

212
00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I went on my phone to get on twitter to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see them,</v>

213
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 5>make sure the world was still happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I was like,</v>

214
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I was in some weird twilight</v>
<v Speaker 5>zone.</v>

215
00:08:59.161 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

217
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 5>forced myself to go to sleep because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

218
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 5>I can't be awake like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I forced myself to go to sleep.</v>

219
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 5>I woke up the next morning,</v>

<v Speaker 5>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>

221
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.070
