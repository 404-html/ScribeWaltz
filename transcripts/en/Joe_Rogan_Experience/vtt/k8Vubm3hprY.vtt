122
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>it would fuck up your flow if I was deejaying.</v>

123
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you were like doing an after party and people have tried to take selfies</v>

124
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.464
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

159
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>and then Tony Trim,</v>

160
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.851
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

161
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

162
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>the Dj that travels with him was like,</v>

163
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

165
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

166
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's what really got me to do it.</v>

167
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Throw one up.</v>

168
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at that white guy dance.</v>

169
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.704
<v Speaker 1>Move</v>

170
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.031
<v Speaker 1>that move.</v>

171
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.864
<v Speaker 1>You're doing there.</v>

172
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this.</v>

173
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.453
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

176
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what really geeked me out.</v>

177
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.273
<v Speaker 1>Was that</v>

178
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.351
<v Speaker 1>the name?</v>

179
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Dj Dad math came because he was becoming a father at the time and I was like,</v>

180
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you're like wait lane Browley or me a dad.</v>

181
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And then it kind of morphed into Dj Dan.</v>

182
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

183
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.241
<v Speaker 1>All that's true.</v>

184
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:33.241
<v Speaker 1>But taking it onto morning news was like a one time ago that was like so funny.</v>

185
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like all the time,</v>

186
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

187
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>So when you went on as a onetime goof,</v>

188
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.760
<v Speaker 1>did you have a plan or did you just not really,</v>

189
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.603
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

190
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>the fun thing was to go was because I,</v>

191
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I hate the most when you do,</v>

192
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.711
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

193
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>what can audiences expect this weekend?</v>

194
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 1>They always say that,</v>

195
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

196
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>

197
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

198
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

202
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>what's bothering you right now,</v>

205
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:58.630

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

207
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.711
<v Speaker 1>that's the setup.</v>

208
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Tell what's going on in your life and they think just your there and then they</v>

209
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:02.351
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

210
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.184
<v Speaker 1>just do whatever you want.</v>

211
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

212
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>just have fun with it.</v>

213
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So when they do that,</v>

214
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.694
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

215
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.571
<v Speaker 1>it's not really,</v>

216
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't really give a fuck about comedy.</v>

217
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.143
<v Speaker 1>And then they were like,</v>

218
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.193
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

219
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

220
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's about the after party,</v>

221
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna be DJ here just to goof on them because it was fun to have around and</v>

223
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

224
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.313
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

225
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you are at the funny bone,</v>

226
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

228
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:22.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

229
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:23.014
<v Speaker 1>for a minute</v>

230
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

231
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care about it.</v>

232
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.553
<v Speaker 1>Funny Bone.</v>

233
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the funny bone sitting right there off camera like</v>

234
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>carrots.</v>

235
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the best part is when he sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him</v>

236
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>stupid questions like,</v>

237
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.461

00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you had someone do the bird is fat thing.</v>

240
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>That was the best one.</v>

241
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

242
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>if you ever add,</v>

243
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you go,</v>

244
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.551
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

245
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>ask me about farts or something,</v>

248
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>

249
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

251
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>they know not to,</v>

252
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>they check themselves on asking something provocative or that's not a hundred</v>

253
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:57.974
<v Speaker 1>percent PG.</v>

254
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know how it would go,</v>

255
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but I go,</v>

256
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.890

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.561
<v Speaker 1>ask me my bird.</v>

258
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>So fat and the lady goes,</v>

259
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.853
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

260
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.730

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>so we just are in the middle of this interview</v>

298
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.673
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

299
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Now for people who are wise is funny.</v>

300
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's funny,</v>

301
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Tom and Burt had been doing this thing for a fucking year now where Tom will</v>

302
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>write out the Hashtag burn is fat and then Bert were right.</v>

303
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Tom Is fat and then they'll argue,</v>

304
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>they make videos with their shirts off,</v>

305
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>arguing who's fatter.</v>

306
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.631
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

308
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.111
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>

309
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:21.944
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>it's died down a lot,</v>

311
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but like the fact that that guy did,</v>

312
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>he did it on his own to put a picture of you up.</v>

313
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

314
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.731
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

315
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag burn as fast as I talk about you.</v>

316
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>If I tweet about you hashtag burns fat.</v>

317
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

318
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I really took off mean that we didn't like we talked about on your mom's house,</v>

319
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>but we never thought we do all kinds of silly stuff,</v>

320
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but this one really resonated with the audience.</v>

321
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Why did that one really resonates?</v>

322
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

323
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

324
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

325
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

326
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.290
<v Speaker 1>there was great theories about this and I,</v>

327
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was this,</v>

328
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I think Matt full Trump pointed out to me the full charge said,</v>

329
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you gave him the formula,</v>

331
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.180
<v Speaker 1>you gave audiences a joke formula.</v>

332
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's a person,</v>

333
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a fat joke.</v>

334
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

335
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

336
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.251
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was what,</v>

337
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:06.240
<v Speaker 1>what was fun for people was to say like something,</v>

338
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>just to jump in on something that it's all like the formula is there and you can</v>

339
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.560
<v Speaker 1>just to pick a side.</v>

340
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

341
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the competitive nature of it.</v>

342
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

344
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And they know that you guys really are good friends.</v>

345
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Some did,</v>

346
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>some did not.</v>

347
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say most,</v>

348
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:22.774
<v Speaker 1>most people did.</v>

349
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Most people did.</v>

350
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people get mad.</v>

351
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

352
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 1>So people were like really fucking really harsh and really like,</v>

353
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

354
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I've always fucking hated Barry's a piece of shit.</v>

355
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.321
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>

356
00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:33.071
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

357
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:34.060
<v Speaker 1>like shit like that.</v>

358
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't the majority.</v>

359
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Some people were like that though.</v>

360
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Same thing to me.</v>

362
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

363
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.673
<v Speaker 1>some people were like,</v>

364
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my theories about this Trump thing.</v>

366
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I think people just pick off.</v>

367
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.253
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

368
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.430
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
