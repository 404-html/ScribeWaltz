<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.453
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the uh,</v>

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.181
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez.</v>

5
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Ronda Rousey fight.</v>

6
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>If you got to put some money down,</v>

7
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

8
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you think man?</v>

9
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

10
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I love saying who the fuck knows because you,</v>

11
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>we haven't seen Ronda fight in over a year.</v>

12
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>We don't own the heads are looking at her body.</v>

13
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>She's in insane shape.</v>

14
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>This a pictures of her online throwing punches and you look at her back,</v>

15
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

16
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>oh leash and seeing them,</v>

17
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.093
<v Speaker 1>she's down.</v>

18
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>She's down to fight.</v>

19
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Wake.</v>

20
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Wait already apparently you know,</v>

21
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I think losing to someone like Holly Holm the way she did and to be tired and</v>

22
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>get beat up and the whole deal like look at her back there,</v>

23
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>which is punching the speed bag.</v>

24
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.313
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

25
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>That's where a donkey.</v>

26
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.163
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

27
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the way she lost that fight and how she looked physically,</v>

28
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>she didn't look nothing like this.</v>

29
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Like not even close.</v>

30
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Like she's got all these videos of her running up hills and all this different</v>

31
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

32
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>She looks like way more fit because she got tired in the fight with Holly and</v>

33
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>that was a big factor.</v>

34
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's also getting hit was a big factor.</v>

35
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Getting stunned right away and,</v>

36
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>but really solid conditioning will allow you to recover better than not being in</v>

37
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>such good shape.</v>

38
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you get hit in the Ed.</v>

39
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a a big factor with the guys that are super,</v>

40
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>super fit is how they bounce back.</v>

41
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>

43
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Neil,</v>

44
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Maggie's a good example.</v>

45
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>You can stun that guy in the first round,</v>

46
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but he's so fit.</v>

47
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>He bounces back for her to that,</v>

48
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>that Holly fight.</v>

49
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>

50
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that Ron,</v>

51
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>she always comes to fight,</v>

52
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>she's always in shape.</v>

53
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>She takes that,</v>

54
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.221
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

56
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>it takes it upon herself to Sean have the same sort of dedication towards that</v>

57
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>fight with Holly that she's got towards this fight.</v>

58
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Physically it doesn't let us think.</v>

59
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>We know physically you can say that,</v>

60
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know cause she'd been shooting movies.</v>

61
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>She won't do press count.</v>

62
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

63
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.751
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

64
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know.</v>

65
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>She could take her down her judo and not try to strike with,</v>

66
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>they're just clinch up.</v>

67
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Do that judo trip.</v>

68
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.573
<v Speaker 1>Take her down.</v>

69
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Anybody's in danger of that arm bar.</v>

70
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what she's got.</v>

71
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>That's where she's going to Mandan and this could easily get caught in that arm</v>

72
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:00.651
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>

73
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't shock.</v>

74
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question for age.</v>

75
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:02.964
<v Speaker 1>Just got to drag her.</v>

76
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.671
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question.</v>

77
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:04.141
<v Speaker 1>Where did you guys,</v>

78
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:09.141
<v Speaker 1>do you think she has the coaching to make changes where she just doesn't pull</v>

79
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>forward on Amanda Nunez and get punched in the face?</v>

80
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>She's going to become,</v>

81
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>of course she's going to take her time.</v>

82
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course she's not going to go out there reckless.</v>

83
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna take her time.</v>

84
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how she came round around Shit anyways,</v>

85
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like common sense.</v>

86
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking get crazy.</v>

87
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Get in there and just fucking get the blood going.</v>

88
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not her.</v>

89
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.153
<v Speaker 1>That's not her head.</v>

90
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get to man Mike Tyson,</v>

91
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>gay sound outside and Jab and do.</v>

92
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>She might try to overwhelm arm,</v>

93
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but she's not stupid.</v>

94
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>She's going to learn from mistakes.</v>

95
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>They just fight a cleaner fight,</v>

96
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:36.751
<v Speaker 1>more movement,</v>

97
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>more head movement.</v>

98
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>The surgery.</v>

99
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>She's had knee surgery since then.</v>

100
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>She could take Amanda down.</v>

101
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I think she can take cat cat,</v>

102
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.403
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

103
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>cat Zingano had a real hard first round and the first round in man and Nunez is</v>

104
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>beating the shit out of her cat Nunez.</v>

105
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Art Cat Nunez.</v>

106
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Cat Cat came back and stopped new needs that's got her on the back.</v>

107
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Let her down for a cardio.</v>

108
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>If Rhonda,</v>

109
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.101
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

110
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>it's tough because what makes Rhonda great is there's this flurry,</v>

111
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>there's exchange.</v>

112
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know you're f she fucking hip toss you in your non bar.</v>

113
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:10.071
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

114
00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing.</v>

115
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>She's not really gonna sit on outside.</v>

116
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:12.731
<v Speaker 1>Be patient.</v>

117
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.564
<v Speaker 1>That's not her.</v>

118
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>But if she can like Vitsa a dog fight.</v>

119
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.551
<v Speaker 1>I think Rhonda,</v>

120
00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I ended up catching a fourth or fifth round cause Amanda,</v>

121
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>she starts off like a tidal wave and we've seen in her losses she kind of slows</v>

122
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

123
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.673
<v Speaker 1>She just does.</v>

124
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Well it's going to be interesting to see if American top team has been able to</v>

126
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>do something to mitigate that.</v>

127
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.893
<v Speaker 1>If they've,</v>

128
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>who knows what kind of strength conditioning program she's under now.</v>

129
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Speaker 1>The only problem I take class quick.</v>

130
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>If Rhonda takes her down and ends up on top,</v>

131
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.990
<v Speaker 1>she might have a hard time passing Amanda Nunez Guard and we'll see like Ron</v>

132
00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>does not.</v>

133
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>She's not known for guard passing,</v>

134
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>so that could be a problem.</v>

135
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.661
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she,</v>

136
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>she creates scrambles.</v>

137
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

138
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.023
<v Speaker 1>That's her thing,</v>

139
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's a letter to him to get up.</v>

140
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>If she can get her on her back,</v>

141
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>how will she,</v>

142
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>she deal with passing the guard.</v>

143
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 1>She really doesn't.</v>

144
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>She goes to it and then she's going to transition from there.</v>

145
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.821
<v Speaker 1>You got to deal with it.</v>

146
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>With a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

147
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to deal with the guard pass.</v>

148
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>It's nine to really submit anybody.</v>

149
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not a right.</v>

150
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda can get on top of her that well.</v>

151
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>She's a black mesh chain.</v>

152
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>She submitted me should Tate.</v>

153
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>She's a black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

154
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

155
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>After Mcmahon too.</v>

156
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>She battered both of them and submitted bullshit.</v>

157
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.081
<v Speaker 1>She what?</v>

158
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Both their ass is different submission that she submits air McMahon.</v>

159
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>She submitted a cat deaf crap.</v>

160
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>The submitted Meesha that beat her up.</v>

161
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

162
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:25.931
<v Speaker 1>not cat.</v>

163
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

164
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>She submitted me Hsa.</v>

165
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.610
<v Speaker 1>She submitted nature,</v>

166
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.330
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>

167
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>She did the same thing to Sarah McMahon.</v>

168
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I think she cracked her and then and then put her away with a choke.</v>

169
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>The one pretty sure the one thing she has over Rhonda in this fight is power.</v>

170
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>She has vicious power.</v>

171
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Striking.</v>

172
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>and I say that's it.</v>

174
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that if Rhonda does come at her full clip like that,</v>

175
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a very risky proposition.</v>

176
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>She can crack so fucking hard,</v>

177
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but if Rhonda feels like she can get closer to that.</v>

178
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

179
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.903
<v Speaker 1>She's not,</v>

180
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>she's not dropping punch.</v>

181
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

182
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>She's not scary.</v>

183
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

184
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

185
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

186
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

187
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Amanda.</v>

188
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.313
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez.</v>

189
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>She's working girls.</v>

190
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Only one shot.</v>

191
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.251
<v Speaker 1>She's dropping them.</v>

192
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And Shane a blazer.</v>

193
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

194
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>she's marking girls.</v>

195
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>She needed a just clinch a punch.</v>

197
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>As hard as you only fucking woman in that division.</v>

198
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>She might be the hardest women puncher in the 135 she's the hardest one.</v>

199
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>And Punch her outside of Cyborg.</v>

200
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll sidewalks,</v>

201
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>not one 35 I'm just saying females in general,</v>

202
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.460
<v Speaker 1>she's the hardest puncher.</v>

203
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Sideboards of different shit.</v>

204
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.711
<v Speaker 1>You want to see her fight?</v>

205
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:27.544
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

206
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Mine stays the same.</v>

207
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the fight with Nisha?</v>

208
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

209
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you see her fight with Mischa?</v>

210
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez.</v>

211
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Nisha?</v>

212
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

213
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.091
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

214
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot all about Amanda Nunez Stopping Misha.</v>

215
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.214
<v Speaker 1>She beat her up.</v>

216
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.533
<v Speaker 1>She wanted the belt.</v>

217
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

218
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>What about the Sarah McMahon fight night</v>

219
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>go before that because before that is when she was beating her up on the feet.</v>

220
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

221
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

222
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>She's got a nasty jab to match.</v>

223
00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:54.791
<v Speaker 1>She steps in.</v>

224
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to distance to boom,</v>

225
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.184
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

226
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Good scramble.</v>

227
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>The question is like,</v>

228
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>is she gonna?</v>

229
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between dealing with Rhonda and dealing with Meesha.</v>

230
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

231
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>this is a mauling man.</v>

232
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>She'd beat the brakes off of her.</v>

233
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Amanda is just putting it to me.</v>

234
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Should tape and you just,</v>

235
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>she just has long ass punches too and then she gets her back.</v>

236
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>This size sounds are out.</v>

237
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>If Ron is in the right frame of mind,</v>

238
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I think she does rush in like she usually does.</v>

239
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Probably eats a shot,</v>

240
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>but then she gets inside,</v>

241
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>gets around to hook,</v>

242
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>takes her for a ride and submits in the first round.</v>

243
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:25.511
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

244
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I hope nobody tests positive for anything</v>

245
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.090
<v Speaker 1>to so many people again.</v>

246
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Pop.</v>

247
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.450
<v Speaker 1>How about sideboard?</v>

248
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

249
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

250
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Game over.</v>

251
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>No matter what.</v>

252
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>It's for game fucking over men.</v>

253
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Now ruins goes told Ya fucking told ya my face.</v>

254
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>When I watch a UFC promo these days,</v>

255
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I see you're skeptical,</v>

256
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 1>liberal and raise you a super skeptical snake.</v>

257
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:45.141
<v Speaker 1>That's exact.</v>

258
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Where for about Bro.</v>

259
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>That's because they're not showing Amanda Nunes.</v>

260
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of fucked up,</v>

261
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:51.801
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

262
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:52.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>like someone pointed out like when you're watching these promos,</v>

264
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>their movies now it's like this little film.</v>

265
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not like training footage.</v>

266
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>People talking about it like this really swear slickly produced movie thing.</v>

267
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>The story is fucking great.</v>

268
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

269
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:05.261
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez.</v>

270
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:06.094
<v Speaker 1>A story's great.</v>

271
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>First openly gay world champion.</v>

273
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Fricking Brazilian.</v>

274
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

275
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>knock out a highlight reel.</v>

276
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Highlight reels.</v>

277
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Smash her fucking work.</v>

279
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Like she's the devil and then,</v>

280
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.261
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>

281
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't show any Ronit chaos.</v>

282
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like that just,</v>

283
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like men in black where they just want you to erase that from your memory.</v>

284
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Any of that,</v>

285
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>plenty of that video going around on its own.</v>

286
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows what happened.</v>

287
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you need to discuss.</v>

288
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I think they could have done it in that video and then showing the workout to</v>

289
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>the return and it might be even more dramatic showing her crying,</v>

290
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>showing her building back up,</v>

291
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>picking up the pieces again.</v>

292
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

293
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

294
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you wanted to go deep,</v>

295
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

296
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be in the movie,</v>

297
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:44.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>If you have a Rhonda Rousey life story movie that's gotta be in the movie course</v>

299
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent if she comes back and wins,</v>

300
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's exactly what you're going to see.</v>

301
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see all the pain Ronda Rousey today right now.</v>

302
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean she is who she is right now.</v>

303
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>What's going on right now is because what happened with Holly Holm,</v>

304
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you know this is her comeback does,</v>

305
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>is it can't you pull off the comeback?</v>

306
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

307
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>the only reason you can come back against who,</v>

308
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.381
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

309
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>the average fan is going come back against who she's been,</v>

310
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:13.450
<v Speaker 1>the favorite and every fight she's ever been,</v>

311
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez.</v>

312
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Like they haven't showed shit at all.</v>

313
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It does very little footage that they're showing in these problems.</v>

314
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>They're showing Nunez.</v>

315
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Stop watching boxing as to put it back on fucking,</v>

316
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:25.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

317
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't see an fs one.</v>

318
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

319
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>they're on boxing.</v>

320
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:30.711
<v Speaker 1>That work.</v>

321
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll that Joe tweeted them know I tweeted a big,</v>

322
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>like while I was watching it at home,</v>

323
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.871
<v Speaker 1>I was watching,</v>

324
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I was actually in a hotel room.</v>

325
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that UFC on Fox where Michelle Waterson beat Paige vanzant and I</v>

326
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:43.061
<v Speaker 1>was watching.</v>

327
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:43.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

328
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>this is so bizarre.</v>

329
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>They're not showing the champion to show in this giant Promo and it's all</v>

330
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:49.041
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda,</v>

331
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:51.510
<v Speaker 1>which makes some sense because Rhonda is huge and she,</v>

332
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you want to let everybody know that she's coming back.</v>

333
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>But don't you want to let everybody know that she's coming back against a killer</v>

334
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.310
<v Speaker 1>against you?</v>

335
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Want everybody know that she's coming back to fight the champion Joe?</v>

336
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Just just from a business aspect.</v>

337
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>What in some weird world in MMA,</v>

338
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:07.490
<v Speaker 1>what if Amanda Nunez Mercer in the first year she has look,</v>

339
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>no one knows it.</v>

340
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.581
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

341
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.414
<v Speaker 1>Is one of them.</v>

342
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.021
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>

343
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>You seen her face to see her face,</v>

344
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but like most of the pieces about Rhonda,</v>

345
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's a few of these,</v>

346
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:15.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a few different ones.</v>

348
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

349
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:17.821
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

350
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:18.001
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

351
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>What happened that she melts Ron here,</v>

352
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.244
<v Speaker 1>they're showing,</v>

353
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>they showed her head kick and you look at the Saudis to somebody else's trailer,</v>

354
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

355
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.900
<v Speaker 1>This isn't created shit.</v>

356
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.833
<v Speaker 1>Trying to find the real one.</v>

357
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.450
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

358
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.283
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>

359
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot longer than an actual promo too.</v>

360
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Like how long has that video right there?</v>

361
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.883
<v Speaker 1>Those two minutes?</v>

362
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>

364
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:36.421
<v Speaker 1>Jail.</v>

365
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.660
<v Speaker 1>What happens if some weird,</v>

366
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>some weird MMA world.</v>

367
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:39.770
<v Speaker 1>A man,</v>

368
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>his word is weird at all and then we're gone.</v>

369
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's weird?</v>

370
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.703
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

371
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

372
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.971
<v Speaker 1>It's real dangerous.</v>

373
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Marcy is acting like it.</v>

374
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>They're putting all their chips in this basket where if Amanda Nunez does her</v>

375
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>thing and it happens,</v>

376
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.480
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

377
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that was one,</v>

378
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.230
<v Speaker 1>but Rhonda is a thousand times more popular.</v>

379
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 1>They're not popular then Amanda Nunez.</v>

380
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent a hundred percent where the money's coming from money.</v>

381
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>But every,</v>

382
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.421
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

383
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:04.300
<v Speaker 1>You've already established she,</v>

384
00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda is it,</v>

385
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.311
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>

386
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>You're already establishing the Ron is fighting.</v>

387
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>What do you want everybody to know?</v>

388
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.731
<v Speaker 1>She's fighting a killer.</v>

389
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Who she fighting?</v>

390
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're tuning him for.</v>

391
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

392
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the matchup.</v>

393
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

394
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Just selling it as if the whole thing that you're seeing is her coming back.</v>

395
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

396
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying in some,</v>

397
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>in business one on one,</v>

398
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.760
<v Speaker 1>what happened if that other person wins and we don't know shit about her UFC</v>

399
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.201
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

400
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.034
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

401
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 1>There's just not much of it.</v>

403
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see a bunch of different,</v>

404
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 1>if she wins then they'll blow her up.</v>

405
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.873
<v Speaker 1>There's still timing.</v>

406
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>We have a deadline.</v>

407
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.290
<v Speaker 1>If she willing can fight Ronda Rousey once,</v>

408
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>get this one we manage.</v>

409
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe or twice.</v>

410
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no room or no it was,</v>

411
00:10:45.281 --> 00:10:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but at least you know that's the girl that beat my met.</v>

412
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 1>She'll be just like Holly Holm,</v>

413
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>instantly huge.</v>

414
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'm on fucking Ellen and all that shit.</v>

415
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Holly's in an interesting place to write cause she was instantly huge.</v>

416
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And then she loses two in a row.</v>

417
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.913
<v Speaker 1>Two straight.</v>

418
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And she loses to,</v>

420
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>to like two completely different styles.</v>

421
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>She gets choked out by Meesha against a better grappler.</v>

422
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>And then she gets a check the lot by volunteership Chenko and Mount Tina.</v>

423
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

424
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see that promo if it's possible.</v>

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Smashing people.</v>

436
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So this is uh,</v>

437
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.240
<v Speaker 1>is this the same one as the card?</v>

438
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>She uses a different one.</v>

439
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the Holly Holly.</v>

440
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>So this is going to show it at the end of November.</v>

441
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

442
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't show show it.</v>

443
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.621
<v Speaker 1>They cut.</v>

444
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh they go black.</v>

445
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And then you see Holly winning.</v>

446
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

447
00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:41.404
<v Speaker 1>See what she,</v>

448
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 1>what she likes skeptical.</v>

449
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:43.344
<v Speaker 1>Snake.</v>

450
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to go down more than it has to be done more actually.</v>

451
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Like you see he's up.</v>

452
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's progression of his mouth and the progression of the belt.</v>

453
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>You see the progression of the belt,</v>

454
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see her getting head kicked.</v>

455
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

456
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not show the highlight?</v>

457
00:11:58.841 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

458
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>What will you doing is you're showing preferential treatment for one athlete</v>

459
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.514
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

460
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that the ability and the fame that she's reached you,</v>

461
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 1>you show preferential treatment because she's different.</v>

462
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.853
<v Speaker 1>She's special.</v>

463
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
<v Speaker 1>She's different.</v>

464
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 1>She's doing massive star.</v>

465
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>She is a massive star.</v>

466
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

467
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the girl that's going to put this the asses in the seats right there.</v>

468
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

469
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 1>She's got bigger than Conor though.</v>

470
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.903
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

471
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 1>But as far as women go,</v>

472
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 1>she is the,</v>

473
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the corner of the timeout.</v>

474
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm done about fighters.</v>

475
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

476
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

477
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 1>his division is not even close.</v>

478
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

479
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:29.951
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>

480
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no one like there's no one like,</v>

481
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.320
<v Speaker 1>but just cause Connors sells more tickets doesn't mean she's an,</v>

482
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they have multiple stores,</v>

483
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:37.460
<v Speaker 1>multiple elite stars and she,</v>

484
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and here you see Amanda doing some workouts,</v>

485
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>just lifting some words.</v>

487
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Girlfriend's a strawweight in the EOC is she?</v>

488
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.953

<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez.</v>

491
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And you see some highlights.</v>

492
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>So this one is showing more.</v>

493
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So this is a different one than the one where they roll up the one that they see</v>

494
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>on TV where they roll up the garage door and he's here hitting the pads.</v>

495
00:12:59.141 --> 00:12:59.974
<v Speaker 1>Pop up and that's it.</v>
