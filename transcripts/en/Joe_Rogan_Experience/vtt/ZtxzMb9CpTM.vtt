<v Speaker 1>you have a podcast now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've inspired me.</v>

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need people like you out there.</v>

11
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have like,</v>

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven episodes so far?</v>

13
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Seven episodes up a few more in the can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to dribble mail once a</v>

14
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>for the first six months or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how it goes.</v>

16
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Are you enjoying the process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am mindscape by the way,</v>

17
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>is the name for those out there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast land?</v>

18
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:36.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving it.</v>

19
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that tilted me over toward</v>

21
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>doing it because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

22
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a day job,</v>

23
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't spend too much time doing this</v>

24
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:44.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but what I realized it was an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a licensed to talk to people who are not</v>

26
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>just physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Because like I had the intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests that go way beyond just what I</v>

28
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in academia,</v>

29
00:00:55.891 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to take seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than your discipline,</v>

30
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm allowed to be talking about physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing else.</v>

32
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>But so now I can talk to historians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists and philosophers and</v>

33
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you could've just gone to evergreen</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and then you could talk about</v>

35
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching a professor.</v>

36
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>You could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a professor,</v>

37
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you could teach them dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to break it out of the system.</v>

38
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>We have to do it ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To break out of that system.</v>

40
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>So your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decided that this would be a great</v>

41
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>venue for you to just to expand on</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects and just get into anything that</v>

42
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

44
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I have opinions about things and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been one who said you shouldn't</v>

45
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>talk about things unless you're a phd.</v>

46
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Credentialed expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone should be talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

48
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but you should know what your level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise is.</v>

49
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not an expert and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should listen to people and they should</v>

50
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>then make your own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should first gathered the</v>

51
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>information and so I don't feel quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can go,</v>

52
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I have a blog and write whatever I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my blog,</v>

53
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but I can't really expound on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of economics because what do I</v>

54
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>know about economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can call up but very expert</v>

55
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>economist and chat with them when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and both I will learn something</v>

56
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully the listeners as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to just basically talk</v>

57
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shtick is we sort of tried to pick</v>

58
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So for the hour or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have your statement.</v>

60
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't do the two and a half hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

61
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I know I need more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need more nitrogen caffeine in me.</v>

62
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

63
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half,</v>

64
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get someone who's an expert and</v>

65
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>we'll dig into an idea and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what's going on,</v>

66
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:34.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

67
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>in sort of everyday people's language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it fits into the bigger picture</v>

68
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

69
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>trying to mix up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>good old professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are my peer group to sort of,</v>

71
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I got some people coming out of left</v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

72
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I had a professional poker player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a movie director coming up,</v>

73
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>a chef and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>but basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

75
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

76
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So is this for your own edification or</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you just using it as just a</v>

77
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

78
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that my,</v>

79
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>like philosophically I treat it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for me,</v>

80
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not going to do guests or</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics or not do topics because the</v>

82
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>people say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

83
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people out there who</v>

84
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>don't want me to talk about anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than physics or at least nothing</v>

85
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that involves politics or religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay in your lane,</v>

86
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much.</v>

87
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love talking about politics and</v>

88
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guess what,</v>

89
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then hopefully it finds an audience,</v>

91
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

92
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>so I'm willing to listen to suggestions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly I have to treat it like it's</v>

93
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absurd to ask someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talk about things if people love</v>

95
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I especially love,</v>

96
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commenters saying,</v>

97
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>of course he's a scientist so he knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing about politics.</v>

99
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an anonymous youtube commentor.</v>

100
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Why should I listen to your opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about politics?</v>

101
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>You definitely can't listen to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions of anybody that's willing to</v>

102
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>take the time to comment on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

103
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem with that whole bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because I was like,</v>

104
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a person does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who,</v>

105
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Speaker 1>who listens to a video and goes wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that are put her in March.</v>

106
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>He takes it very rare breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless they have like a real specific</v>

107
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>expertise in what's being discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it's about auto repair and</v>

108
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>like that is not how you replace a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission.</v>

109
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you just ask him questions like I</v>

110
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>love my calendar's like mostly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments even on my youtube,</v>

111
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>like so I send the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do video,</v>

112
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing audio podcasts.</v>

113
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>But you can put them on youtube with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>static image and for some reason people</v>

114
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

115
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>People listen to podcasts on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

117
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the comments have actually overall been</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly good because youtube is one</v>

118
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>of the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

120
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

121
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that or tell me more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or this was interesting.</v>

122
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By all means do it.</v>

123
00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>But if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk about that,</v>

124
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

125
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away.</v>

126
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It only takes a tiny drop of Lsd to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollute a whole bucket of water.</v>

127
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>There you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the deal is with youtube comments,</v>

128
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just the sheer number of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

129
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that youtube has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated group of shitheads and trolls</v>

130
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why would that platform</v>

131
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>seems to track some of the worst in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that comment and I'm,</v>

132
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot claim that I'm immune to a</v>

133
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>reading it and getting annoyed.</v>

134
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you idiot,</v>

135
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should just say forget it.</v>

136
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Move on with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

137
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

138
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's something fascinating</v>

139
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:52.951
<v Speaker 1>about this new form of communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone can send this a very just</v>

140
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>flat text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything about the</v>

141
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:02.620
<v Speaker 1>background of the person who's sending</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and there's a style of doing that</v>

142
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>that's designed to kind of mess with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head just to poke out your nerves.</v>

143
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look,</v>

144
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>let's let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just,</v>

145
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to redress the balance here.</v>

146
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great that we have these new ways</v>

147
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>of talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

148
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And part of glancingly mentioned the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that academia wants you to stay in</v>

149
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>your lane very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>

150
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that part of the many</v>

151
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:31.511
<v Speaker 1>hidden purposes of my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is to dissolve the boundary</v>

152
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>between science and the rest of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual life.</v>

153
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

154
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they'll be talking about</v>

155
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I won't.</v>

156
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to silo off science as a thing.</v>

157
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And then like economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics and history and political</v>

158
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>science is another thing that is out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and relevant to the world and</v>

159
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>science is something that is sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of entertainment for a lot of</v>

160
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>people and I want to mix it all up by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different people talking to each</v>

161
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so overall by all means comment on</v>

162
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>the youtube videos and you'll keep that</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation going.</v>

163
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>That's good of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

164
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very healthy attitude and</v>

165
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the attitude that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have if you're putting</v>

166
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>everything out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And just one more irony is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

168
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't seek conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a conflict averse person.</v>

169
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to argue with people,</v>

170
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to say things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>true and not everyone agrees about what</v>

171
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>is true.</v>

172
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So there's going to be arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put up with that,</v>

173
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:25.541
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not seeking it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would like this utopia of rational</v>

174
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>discourse where everyone is talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about ideas in a dispassionate way and</v>

175
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>in good faith looking toward moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the truth.</v>

176
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice if we had like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

177
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a rating system for</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

178
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 1>like a yelp for commentators that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying,</v>

179
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that it's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really isn't.</v>

180
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people review your comments on</v>

181
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>things and enough people decide like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just unnecessary yelp for</v>

182
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>expertise or for commentary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally all the above.</v>

183
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think uh,</v>

184
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>we're probably going to move to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a system like that.</v>

185
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are actually advocating that</v>

186
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>for society to have some sort of a like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rating system for people and almost a</v>

187
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>new kind of currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a social currency.</v>

188
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

189
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:24.371
<v Speaker 1>You've heard this scary for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>though because it's China and China is</v>

190
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a trippy place and it's very trippy</v>

191
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of got capitalism going,</v>

192
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a communist dictatorship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is big for the government in</v>

193
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the companies are also in,</v>

194
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing with Huawei.</v>

195
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting mad at me about that.</v>

196
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Huawei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Walway,</v>

197
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the now that number two cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer in the world and they're</v>

198
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>for bidden to work with us carriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States does not trust this</v>

199
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've said,</v>

200
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company is apparently done some</v>

201
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>shading things according to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not according to certain tech people say</v>

202
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>it's nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there so that another,</v>

203
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>keeping them from selling their cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones with 18 t and t mobile,</v>

204
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

205
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're the number two manufacturer</v>

206
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.030
<v Speaker 1>in the world now that just surpassed</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple because China is just.</v>

207
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>China's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

210
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>they know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of remarkable to me that China</v>

211
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.450
<v Speaker 1>has been so stable and successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are,</v>

212
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't like it.</v>

213
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>There are people who rebel against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

214
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the government's been so enormously</v>

215
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>successful in controlling inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

216
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you learn,</v>

217
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:40.210
<v Speaker 1>like you can't Google Tiananmen Square</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to a,</v>

218
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you can't get those images or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

219
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And companies want to do business there</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll go along with it.</v>

220
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure if it's stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

221
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this when I last podcast</v>

222
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>with the ultra monk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that democracy is stable</v>

223
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:53.971
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

224
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

225
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>when the technological capabilities are</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing so rapidly,</v>

226
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>a huge abuses and huge changes are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horizon.</v>

227
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Even we don't know what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

228
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

229
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>that's my worry about the social credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

230
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:06.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

231
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously abusable make the wrong</v>

232
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>people have bad credit and make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you like.</v>

233
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is run by the government,</v>

234
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to trust them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 1>do it fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

236
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little skeptical about that.</v>

237
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this last election and the</v>

238
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>subsequent analysis of the manipulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the election has been very eyeopening</v>

239
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

240
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

241
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the Russian troll farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you been paying attention to that</v>

242
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

243
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.660
<v Speaker 1>that is a stunning revelation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 24 slash seven businesses where</v>

244
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:49.011
<v Speaker 1>people are set up where they're hired to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tweet and post things and comment</v>

245
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:55.761
<v Speaker 1>on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're all working in some way to</v>

246
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>try to manipulate the way people look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>

247
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most interesting thing to me,</v>

248
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I thought like if they were clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will do this and they do it.</v>

249
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that they have a policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to push,</v>

250
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or candidate they want to push,</v>

251
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>they want to foment disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will take the most radical views on</v>

252
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>either side and pump them up just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are tearing at each other's</v>

253
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>throats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

254
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 1>that kind of works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

255
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty successful so far.</v>

256
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a radiolab podcast where these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were trump supporters</v>

257
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>detailed being contacted by these</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian troll farms where they organize</v>

258
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:38.451
<v Speaker 1>these rallies and they organize these</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests and they even hired a fake</v>

259
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fought,</v>

260
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>they hired a fake trump and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna have the Hillary and a cage and</v>

261
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>they wanted everybody to yell out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock her up and this,</v>

262
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>these Russians coordinated this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

263
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once it starts,</v>

264
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organically</v>

265
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 2>takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

266
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

267
00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you probably saw just the other day this</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trump rally where the CNN reporter was</v>

268
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 2>trying to do a seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do a camera spot and he</v>

269
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.100
<v Speaker 2>just like got drowned out by people</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting at him and you know,</v>

270
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>shouting obscenities and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

271
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.551
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

272
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.061
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

273
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>

274
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 2>The media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want that to happen to Fox</v>

275
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want that to happen to people</v>

276
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.160
<v Speaker 2>that disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GotTa let the people in the media,</v>

277
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.310
<v Speaker 2>but media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not the enemy of the people and</v>

278
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 2>what he's done is very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

279
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

280
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 2>it's very sneaky and very dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very manipulative and he's</v>

281
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in survival mode and when people</v>

282
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.480
<v Speaker 2>are in survival mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

283
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 2>he's not thinking at all about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of the press.</v>

284
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking about his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his situation,</v>

285
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 2>his stance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his position in life.</v>

286
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Preserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the best way to preserve that</v>

287
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 2>when someone's attacking me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack the people who are attacking me.</v>

288
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:49.901
<v Speaker 2>Any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 2>You build yourself up by creating an</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy that everyone can agree on right?</v>

290
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 2>One of the chilling things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out,</v>

291
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 2>there's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the rhetoric,</v>

292
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 2>there's never been a successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly multiethnic democracy in the</v>

293
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 2>history of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like democracies that have worked,</v>

294
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 2>have worked because one group is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>

295
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

296
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>they give rights to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and so forth and try to be fair</v>

297
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 2>to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's changing,</v>

298
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 2>like as the demographics of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>are changing,</v>

299
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

300
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>we're becoming more of the patchwork</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we claimed to be years ago and</v>

301
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 2>people aren't quite happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not comfortable with it.</v>

302
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that can be used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gin up emotional reactions.</v>

303
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people are terrified of change</v>

304
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is this nostalgia for the past?</v>

305
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

306
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the past that is not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate that they,</v>

307
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they envision.</v>

308
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

309
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sympathetic with the real</v>

310
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.421
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

311
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 2>They're real problems with inequality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with healthcare and with jobs and</v>

312
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the number of jobs,</v>

313
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but the jobs are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone is really tooled up to be a</v>

314
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 2>high tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a office worker in this day and age and</v>

315
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 2>so I take those concerns really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really seriously,</v>

316
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but those concerns being channeled and</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unproductive ways to scapegoat</v>

317
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 2>people who don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things,</v>

318
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.250
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seems to be boiling under the</v>

319
00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:18.251
<v Speaker 3>surface is the possibility that we might</v>
<v Speaker 3>need some sort of universal basic income</v>

320
00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:23.921
<v Speaker 3>to deal with what's happening with ai</v>
<v Speaker 3>and automate automate station like auto</v>

321
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 3>automation of m cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>automation of normal jobs that put food</v>

322
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:34.550
<v Speaker 3>preparation and things that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>come to.</v>

323
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Just take for granted that a human's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be doing that.</v>

324
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.490
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that millions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of people are</v>

325
00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:43.970
<v Speaker 3>going to be out of work within a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>short period of time and it seems to me</v>

326
00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 3>that it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those sneaky things that</v>

327
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:48.230
<v Speaker 3>might just catch us before we're ready</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

328
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you extrapolate very far</v>

329
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.540
<v Speaker 1>ahead into the future and imagining what</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia is supposed to look like or you</v>

330
00:14:55.541 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>know the far technologically advanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

331
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't we imagined that work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>done by robots and machines and human</v>

332
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>beings are free to be creative or</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic or athletic or just sit on</v>

333
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>their butts if that's what they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

334
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that that's a possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>future than the way to get there is to,</v>

335
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 1>as robots and machines do more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it more and more possible for</v>

336
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>people to live without working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a is at least I have no</v>

337
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>idea whether it works in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an economist.</v>

338
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I haven't studied it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it should be taken seriously</v>

339
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>as an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at it as a pessimist and</v>

340
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at it with a cynical</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

341
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

342
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>people just want.</v>

343
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't have motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they behave like rich kids or</v>

344
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>entitled people or people who won the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery.</v>

345
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>They blow all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't take it seriously because</v>

346
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 1>they didn't earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes against human nature.</v>

347
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

348
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it does let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

349
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>who am I to tell people that they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be virtuous by earning a living in</v>

350
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>some job they may or may not be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep for very long.</v>

351
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>The people who say that usually haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten fired from their jobs raise.</v>

352
00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.281
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

353
00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And I always feel like the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually ambitious but the real</v>

355
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we'd be growing up with</v>

356
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>

357
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you've got it as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably recognize it as a safety</v>

358
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.064
<v Speaker 1>net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

359
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 1>But as if it was during your</v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental process,</v>

360
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you might rely on it as a constant.</v>

361
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that might be a problem in terms</v>

362
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

363
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

364
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.491
<v Speaker 1>and you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:25.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

366
00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends at various levels of</v>

367
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>income and class that they grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can always tell people who grew</v>

368
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 1>up in very comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>environments because they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

370
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 1>they have projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on a project because they're</v>

371
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>not really worried about the project</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing.</v>

372
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you grew up without that safety</v>

373
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more cautious.</v>

374
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a fail safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a backup plan and.</v>

375
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 1>But what if everyone had that backup</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>

376
00:16:52.431 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>What if we could all do projects instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of work?</v>

377
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Is that really a worse world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know any trust fund people.</v>

378
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

379
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 1>The ones that I know all blow their</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

380
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Actually I know some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some very wealthy people who</v>

381
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:08.600
<v Speaker 1>raise their kids really well and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust fund people.</v>

382
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As people who like never need to work a</v>

383
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>day in their lives and they all work</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

384
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

385
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Find those people and clone them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Find out what made them tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was there.</v>

387
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So they found a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found something that they're</v>

388
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a giant issue.</v>

389
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your parents need to sort of</v>

390
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:27.570
<v Speaker 1>encouraged that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>parents matter when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

393
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>if you are very wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you deserve it or do</v>

394
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:35.571
<v Speaker 1>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

395
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I should give something back because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

396
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 1>really fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

397
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>there's cockamamie ideas that come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that haven't earned their money</v>

398
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one guy came to him with this crazy</v>

399
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 1>idea for this project he's doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting me to get involved in it.</v>

400
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going over the details of it.</v>

401
00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is going to work.</v>

402
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this guy so enthusiastic about</v>

403
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more I dug into it,</v>

404
00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:54.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

405
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.400
<v Speaker 1>he got all this money from his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

406
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 1>well you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just,</v>

407
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got pipe dreams.</v>

408
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

409
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess I feel just to be honest about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

410
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>like I'm very lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

411
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>not because I grew up wealthy because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

412
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>But because I now have a job that</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents what I want to do,</v>

413
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:18.081
<v Speaker 1>like what I would do with my life if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>were independently wealthy.</v>

414
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that different from what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

415
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>

416
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 1>But therefore I kind of think that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like a world where everyone can do</v>

417
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what they wanted,</v>

418
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Speaker 1>that would be amazing.</v>

419
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real question is,</v>

420
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 1>does everybody have an actual interest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't,</v>

421
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 1>is it nurture or nature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't,</v>

422
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>do we force them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that we want to do something you</v>

423
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find something you love.</v>

424
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>The thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never tell people like,</v>

426
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.880
<v Speaker 1>follow your passion or plain what do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>love?</v>

427
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people who need to earn</v>

428
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Speaker 1>a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.390
<v Speaker 1>He's loving people who just need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>work because they need to pay the bills.</v>

430
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be respected.</v>

431
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 1>That in the we have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an an honorable thing to do and</v>

432
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 1>not everyone gets to just do what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

433
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some things though that you</v>

434
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 1>can do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They you'll actually enjoy,</v>

435
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 1>like you need to make a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of your temperament,</v>

436
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.330
<v Speaker 1>because your interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find a thing,</v>

437
00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:20.331
<v Speaker 1>whether it's carpentry or whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you find to be fascinating and</v>

438
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.020
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling when you're actually doing.</v>

439
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You're making a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also doing something that,</v>

440
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:24.961
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

441
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>This is very satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

442
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

443
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be done.</v>

444
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Can it be done for everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

445
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

446
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

447
00:19:35.101 --> 00:19:37.100
<v Speaker 1>there's so many styles of living too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

448
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.850
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

449
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I was in China recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spent some time in Thailand and we</v>

450
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 1>flew through China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you realized about</v>

451
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>China is that just a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of moving.</v>

452
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Like people just walk right through</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

453
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

454
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>their lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a space and align the peanut,</v>

455
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't respect that space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go right into that space right in</v>

456
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

457
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a space there.</v>

458
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even think of it as rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the style,</v>

459
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:05.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

460
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this week we went through</v>

461
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia for a few weeks and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

462
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>visited Vietnam and Thailand and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to each other,</v>

463
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but just the behavior and the city's</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly different.</v>

464
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Like just walking down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different culture.</v>

465
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>

466
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

467
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says that.</v>

468
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

469
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for a few days.</v>

470
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that there's depths to the</v>

471
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:28.450
<v Speaker 1>country that I didn't perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

472
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was coming to life literally the week</v>

473
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the first.</v>

474
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's was opening in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

475
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>which is not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it meant it was.</v>

476
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 1>We were there in a pre Mcdonald's</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

477
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

478
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.950
<v Speaker 1>it was physically very beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food was amazing.</v>

479
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It was all scattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

480
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>like the people just go crazy on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets in any direction they want and</v>

481
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it was not organized or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

482
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>but it was very genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

484
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.960
<v Speaker 1>People were trying to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem to be very friendly like</v>

485
00:20:56.961 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't speak any other language or</v>

486
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

487
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it was just a wonderful experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall.</v>

488
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

489
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Asia is a trip.</v>

490
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a really different part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

491
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:09.461
<v Speaker 1>China is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

492
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

493
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

494
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a trip for a different reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

495
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

497
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared by China in the sense that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried that they will succeed while</v>

498
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>still being repressive dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

499
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

500
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading these memoirs from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bertrand Russell when he visited China</v>

501
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was rhapsodizing about this is an</v>

502
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>amazing culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing people.</v>

503
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

504
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>does he not know it's a communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship?</v>

505
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>And then my brain kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

506
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 1912.</v>

507
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.370
<v Speaker 1>It was not a communist dictatorship at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

508
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And that there's a great tragedy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that China has been sort of</v>

509
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 1>repressed for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's immense potential and</v>

510
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>promise there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the possibility that they</v>

511
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 1>just remain in this autocracy forever</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people's lives improve and a</v>

512
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 1>lot of people just drudgery for billions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

513
00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible.</v>

514
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:01.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating that they become this</v>

515
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:03.380
<v Speaker 1>combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

516
00:22:03.381 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 1>A combination of both capitalism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>communism.</v>

517
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's it.</v>

518
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Like they found a release valve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he couldn't,</v>

519
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet Union was going to collapse</v>

520
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible system,</v>

521
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:12.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>

522
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>

523
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

524
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And China found this little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance where they still have the</v>

525
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>repressive dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they give enough freedom for people</v>

526
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:26.701
<v Speaker 1>to be ambitious and try to get ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that improves the economy and they make</v>

527
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 1>some terrible mistakes.</v>

528
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're these huge cities that are</v>

529
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one lives there.</v>

530
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.040
<v Speaker 1>And there's these spooky pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

531
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So you've seen the recreations of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>large cities like Paris.</v>

532
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes like cities like Shenzhen,</v>

533
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 1>like right next to Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a city of 5 million people.</v>

534
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years ago it was 50,000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

535
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they built it in a couple of years and,</v>

536
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and other places like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

537
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll build a shopping mall here where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>

538
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

539
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Detroit the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one there knew.</v>

540
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 1>No one makes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one builds anything.</v>

541
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:02.860
<v Speaker 1>No one does anything with it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really capitalism.</v>

542
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's still a planned economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's pluses and minuses with</v>

543
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.134
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

544
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.060
<v Speaker 1>One of the big fears about China is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there experimentation with genetics is</v>

545
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to do things ethically</v>

546
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 1>that scientists in America and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the western world are not</v>

547
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 1>willing to engage in yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Including the use of Crispr on human</v>
<v Speaker 1>embryos.</v>

549
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

550
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have mixed feelings about that.</v>

551
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to happen in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

552
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had.</v>

553
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I haven't released that</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast yet,</v>

554
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but stay tuned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an excellent podcast coming with</v>

555
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Carl Zimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a science writer,</v>

556
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>just wrote a long book about heredity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and genetics and uh,</v>

557
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they're going to be doing a with</v>

558
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the designer</v>

559
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not science fiction as far as I can</v>

560
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 2>tell it's going to happen and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very unclear what it will mean</v>

561
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 2>because we're not any good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And figuring out how genetics turns,</v>

562
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 2>how your DNA turns into a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

563
00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be like,</v>

564
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we find something other that if you</v>

565
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you change this particular gene,</v>

566
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you can live twice as long,</v>

567
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 2>but also you'll have Parkinson's disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're fortunate,</v>

568
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't know what the</v>

569
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 2>interdependencies are and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

570
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

571
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's coming.</v>

572
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea that we will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing embryos to come to term and be</v>

573
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 2>people on the basis of their jeans</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they're,</v>

574
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a implanted in the uterus is,</v>

575
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 2>is 100 percent that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the chance that we're gonna be</v>

576
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 2>editing them is 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine percent chance.</v>

577
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 2>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is way more willing to do that.</v>

578
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure if that's good or</v>

579
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:42.291
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

580
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm more worried about is that,</v>

581
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people figure out a system that will</v>

582
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 2>make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a baby who's guaranteed to</v>

583
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:52.004
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

584
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 2>tall and beautiful and smart and live</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a hundred 50 years and it'll cost</v>

585
00:24:56.991 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that'll be a little bit unfair.</v>

586
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be an issue that will come up.</v>

587
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then isn't it unfair that the rock</v>

588
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>is the rock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did he get to be the rock?</v>

589
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think just psychologically it's a.</v>

590
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I think he worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also had his giant started.</v>

591
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started in the right place.</v>

592
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 2>You know the story of Almay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

593
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

594
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being the basketball player from China,</v>

595
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he was basically the result of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding program really.</v>

596
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Like they encouraged his parents who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were both really tall basketball players</v>

597
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:32.570
<v Speaker 2>to have a baby and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked for him.</v>

598
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always work because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crap shoot.</v>

599
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

600
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.831
<v Speaker 2>it can work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

601
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's normal breeding.</v>

602
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my dog's a good looking dog.</v>

603
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Her dog at the same breed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put them together.</v>

604
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With human beings.</v>

605
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise normal.</v>

606
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

607
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different.</v>

608
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 2>It's different psychologically because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think it's different winning the</v>

609
00:25:56.541 --> 00:26:01.541
<v Speaker 2>lottery than already being rich and</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore being able to afford something</v>

610
00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 2>that changes who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

611
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

612
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people will think that that's</v>

613
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And will these people will be</v>

614
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 2>celebrities and we'll follow them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>

615
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:16.271
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect people be rubbed the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>way at that kind of access to something</v>

616
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>that most people can't afford it most</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly will.</v>

617
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 2>The most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

618
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you look at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively,</v>

619
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the interactions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>

620
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a completely a outside observer,</v>

621
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you would say not only is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable,</v>

622
00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:35.780
<v Speaker 2>but this is going to lead to some really</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular changes in what a human</v>

623
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 2>being is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about a big part of what we're</v>

624
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 2>concerned with constantly on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis is healthcare,</v>

625
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were very concerned</v>

626
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 1>with people that have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>debilitating diseases and if we could</v>

627
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 1>just eliminate all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

628
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably will be able to,</v>

629
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 1>and it will probably happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think is.</v>

630
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then so far almost everyone agrees</v>

631
00:26:57.811 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not the controversial part,</v>

632
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:00.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

633
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>if we can eliminate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently some diseases we already</v>

634
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>know like right there in your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get Huntington's when</v>

635
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you're 40 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

636
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And so those are easy to eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut allergies or something like that</v>

637
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.070
<v Speaker 1>to other diseases are harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what causes them,</v>

638
00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 1>so it'll take time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there'll be</v>

639
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 1>uncontroversial if you could just remove</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases from people ahead of time.</v>

640
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit different if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing their hair color and skin color</v>

641
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 1>and shape of their nose and feed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

642
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.790
<v Speaker 1>That gets a little squirrelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also when the idea of it being</v>

643
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.870
<v Speaker 1>a cost prohibitive issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well isn't that the case with almost all</v>

644
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.910
<v Speaker 1>technology as it emerges?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very memorable.</v>

645
00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Plasma Tvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like $20,000 for a small</v>

646
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I saw them.</v>

647
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It was only like a 30 inch television or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that was exorbitant and I</v>

648
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

649
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Flat hangs on the wall now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has them and they're cheap.</v>

650
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You can get one for a few hundred bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's way bigger and way better than</v>

651
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 1>what it was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

652
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 1>and I think they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very realistic.</v>

653
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That maybe will be million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then 10 years later we'll be</v>

654
00:28:06.911 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 1>$100,000 to sort of be a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

655
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of just like cell phones,</v>

656
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:14.910
<v Speaker 1>like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a really expensive thing</v>

657
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually trickles down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones and becomes available</v>

658
00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:19.950
<v Speaker 1>everywhere to everybody.</v>

659
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the average person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone,</v>

660
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>if you buy the cheap cell phone for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 bucks,</v>

661
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it is way better than an iphone from 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

662
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In every way.</v>

663
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

664
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's one of the things</v>

665
00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 1>that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're,</v>

666
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 1>we're still at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

667
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology's not that advanced compared</v>

668
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:43.110
<v Speaker 1>to where it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

669
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have another podcast guests coming up</v>

670
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:49.770
<v Speaker 1>who is an expert on aging and how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix that by messing with jeans a little</v>

671
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 1>bit gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

672
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.110
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a real scientist at Princeton.</v>

673
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's just doing experimental</v>

674
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.280
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

675
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.200
<v Speaker 1>well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him that well,</v>

676
00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:01.270
<v Speaker 1>so I shouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

677
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as an advocate for anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging,</v>

678
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.420
<v Speaker 1>which is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cool.</v>

679
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my guest,</v>

680
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Colleen Murphy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like a biologist who was</v>

681
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:13.140
<v Speaker 1>working on things and discovered</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was,</v>

682
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.280
<v Speaker 1>she's not trying that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

683
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knock out a certain gene in this</v>

684
00:29:18.021 --> 00:29:20.560
<v Speaker 1>certain worm and it lived twice as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without any twoK ,</v>

685
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

686
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.870
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get old because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

687
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Like why do we die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we grow old?</v>

688
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could design an organism that</v>

689
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would die from random bad things.</v>

690
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 1>You get hit on the head with a brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't need to die.</v>

691
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:42.290
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that evolution programmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging and death into us because once we</v>

692
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.260
<v Speaker 1>have kids or once we've outlived our</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive lifespan,</v>

693
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.180
<v Speaker 1>we're not useful anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So biology is once us to die.</v>

694
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.193
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

695
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's potentially fixable.</v>

696
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be easy,</v>

697
00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>it might be not happened 100 years from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

698
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:56.104
<v Speaker 1>but it could.</v>

699
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 1>aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering,</v>

701
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer interfaces,</v>

702
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is going to within the</v>

703
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 1>next hundred years totally changed what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means to be human being and we're</v>

704
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 1>totally not ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was saying this to Carl</v>

705
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Carl's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that Carl Zimmer was more or less</v>

706
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.280
<v Speaker 1>sanguine about is like don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

707
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put regulations on,</v>

708
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>it'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my attitude was,</v>

709
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually we should think of the absolute</v>

710
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>craziest science fiction scenarios</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to be prepared,</v>

711
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

712
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't come to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to worry about the least probable</v>

713
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>things because it might spark something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually helps us down the road.</v>

714
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent discovery.</v>

715
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a way to shut off</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that causes wrinkles and</v>

716
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 1>reverse the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever is causing your skin to get</v>

717
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 1>wrinkly and sag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're reversing that process.</v>

718
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.520
<v Speaker 1>We might be members of the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation to die</v>

719
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.320
<v Speaker 1>of old age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't be a mortal.</v>

720
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Well then if you thought you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortal,</v>

721
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.771
<v Speaker 1>if you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

722
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you thought that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>average lifespan was a million years,</v>

723
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 1>would you suddenly become way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>cautious?</v>

724
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start jumping off buildings and shit</v>

725
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 1>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a friend of mine who does</v>

726
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the flying squirrel suit stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He holds the world.</v>

727
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't become vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>

728
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flying Squirrels type is truly</v>

729
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:14.890
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

730
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 1>it's super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Base jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they could just fix you if you</v>

732
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 1>like even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a separate thing.</v>

733
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

734
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they get back to your go</v>

735
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>

736
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you just die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they build to your clone,</v>

737
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 1>put you back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these crazy science fiction</v>

738
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's.</v>

739
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I think the backing up is way harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>than people think,</v>

740
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think that stopping aging is way</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier than people think.</v>

741
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.280
<v Speaker 1>But we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

742
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the 20,</v>

743
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.200
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're calling it a conference</v>

744
00:31:44.201 --> 00:31:48.570
<v Speaker 1>in New York City a few years back ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the ray Kurzweil advocates that</v>

745
00:31:48.571 --> 00:31:51.630
<v Speaker 1>think you're going to download brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>into computers and stuff.</v>

746
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Not that compelling like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

747
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with what's</v>

748
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like everybody had this idea of</v>

749
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 1>one day we'll be able to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to take consciousness,</v>

750
00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

751
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a,</v>

752
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.150
<v Speaker 1>b doesn't violate the laws of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hopelessly impractical compared</v>

753
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>to anything we can do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the human brain is just not</v>

754
00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>something you can read out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My question,</v>

755
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 1>and this was something that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned me was what's to keep someone</v>

756
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>from making hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of themselves?</v>

757
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to take someone from some,</v>

758
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really rich billionaire character that</v>

759
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 1>can afford to do this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this many,</v>

760
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:33.450
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to have my clones make</v>

761
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>clones of clones and I'm going to fill</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a whole island with me.</v>

762
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a crazy person.</v>

763
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

764
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are allowed to do crazy things,</v>

765
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if you had 100 Sean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carroll's near House working on things</v>

766
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the same person.</v>

767
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.930
<v Speaker 1>What if you found that the 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sean Carroll Smoking crack and</v>

768
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.730
<v Speaker 1>hookers drawing fast direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>

769
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you realized that that like after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there,</v>

770
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 1>there is a random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

771
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Evo Devo,</v>

772
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you grow up in matters?</v>

773
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That would be really fascinating if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be an excellent episode of black</v>

774
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 1>mirror where someone clone themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and found out that a certain percentage</v>

775
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 1>of the clowns were just fucking crazy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were the crazy one.</v>

776
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the clones were very different</v>

777
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>than them and they rolled seem to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other or maybe having all those clones</v>

778
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another set something off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that made them crazy because they</v>

779
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 1>were in competition with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were exactly like them.</v>

780
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.221
<v Speaker 1>This is golden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

781
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>We should edit this out of the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can write up this episode.</v>

782
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a real concern with messing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology in a way that's never been done</v>

783
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

784
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the extent to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming is something we haven't</v>

785
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 1>quite faced up to you and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

786
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 1>It's coming fast and profoundly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not ready.</v>

787
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the possibility of just creating a</v>

788
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:02.840
<v Speaker 1>world that we're not prepared for and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not prepared for the consequences</v>

789
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

790
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.363
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

791
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 2>All in favor of thinking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

792
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Like just wondering what it will be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the answer is no,</v>

793
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:11.480
<v Speaker 2>that'll never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least,</v>

794
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be prepared a little bit.</v>

795
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.521
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:14.470
<v Speaker 2>think of all the alarms.</v>

797
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Crazy scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

798
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you really gotten into crispr?</v>

799
00:34:19.681 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you really looked into that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all?</v>

800
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.890
<v Speaker 1>a little too applied to real world for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my taste,</v>

802
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.200
<v Speaker 1>but people don't know what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

803
00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:32.010
<v Speaker 1>We're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new technique for editing genes</v>

804
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 1>that was discovered accidentally while</v>
<v Speaker 1>examining the effects of the story is</v>

805
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

806
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.240
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are these bacteria,</v>

807
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

808
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.610
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of DNA as where our genetic</v>

809
00:34:44.611 --> 00:34:45.900
<v Speaker 2>information is stored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

810
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a little code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little list of symbols,</v>

811
00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:53.070
<v Speaker 2>a cgt and their inner hero and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

812
00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:55.470
<v Speaker 2>That is handed down from parents to</v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

813
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.150
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is way more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that because different parts of the</v>

814
00:35:00.151 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 2>DNA do things and different ones don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them get turned on,</v>

815
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.410
<v Speaker 2>turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have mitochondrial DNA which are not</v>

816
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.380
<v Speaker 2>our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had these little sub cells within us</v>

817
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:15.381
<v Speaker 2>that get carried along for the ride and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their own DNA and so crispr is this</v>

818
00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:17.830
<v Speaker 2>thing that was invented by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

819
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Not by human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These bacteria who were trying to resist</v>

820
00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:24.270
<v Speaker 2>viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

821
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.470
<v Speaker 2>So the viruses would come in and attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and basically the de,</v>

822
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 2>the bacteria learned away to steel part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the DNA of the virus and keep it as</v>

823
00:35:35.221 --> 00:35:36.930
<v Speaker 2>like a facial recognition software.</v>

824
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like a template.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

825
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this DNA thing is approaching me that's</v>

826
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 2>a virus and I should attack it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

827
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Like this is something that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned how to fight off.</v>

828
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 2>And so to do that need to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>snip out a little piece of DNA.</v>

829
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>And so scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists learned that they could</v>

830
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.940
<v Speaker 2>train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a little bit fanciful way,</v>

831
00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 2>putting it metaphorical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could train the bacteria to go</v>

832
00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snip out pieces of DNA,</v>

833
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that for any dna you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

834
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

835
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 2>and you can replace it with something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

836
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really very high precision</v>

837
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's coming.</v>

838
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And so in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

839
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little way to change the genetic code</v>

840
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Speaker 2>and then they figured out some other way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ordinarily,</v>

841
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.270
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have two parents and you have</v>

842
00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>like Brown eyes versus blue eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue eyes are recessive.</v>

843
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.420
<v Speaker 2>So they both need to have the blue eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene to give you if you want to have</v>

844
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 2>blue eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they figured out a way that you can</v>

845
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 2>change the DNA and it automatically with</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent accuracy gets sent to all of</v>

846
00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:38.220
<v Speaker 2>your offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

847
00:36:38.221 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not 50 slash 50 chance or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

848
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 2>so then you can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>propagate a change in the genetic code</v>

849
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 2>throughout the species pretty darn</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

850
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.450
<v Speaker 2>And your human beings take a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to breed.</v>

851
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 2>But animals and plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole nother world,</v>

852
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can design those very,</v>

853
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:55.890
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and there's already been at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least one revision of the process,</v>

854
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:57.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

855
00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:58.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

856
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I just told you everything I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know</v>

857
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.360
<v Speaker 3>continuing to improve on the process and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

858
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.320
<v Speaker 3>it's really gonna be very interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see where that goes as far as that</v>

859
00:37:09.321 --> 00:37:10.430
<v Speaker 3>advances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

860
00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I think this was a concern with places</v>
<v Speaker 3>like China,</v>

861
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're already doing this.</v>

862
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.890
<v Speaker 3>They're already manipulating genetics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to create super people</v>

863
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.400
<v Speaker 2>and I think that the chances that gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>them a great basketball team or greater</v>

864
00:37:22.401 --> 00:37:24.890
<v Speaker 2>than the chances that it gave them a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of brilliant phd scientist.</v>

865
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in.</v>

866
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.630
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it starts in competitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletics.</v>

867
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Have you paid attention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch the documentary?</v>

868
00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:32.020
<v Speaker 3>ICARUS?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

869
00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:34.060
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating documentary that's on</v>

870
00:37:34.061 --> 00:37:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Netflix right now about it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is kind of a crazy set of</v>

871
00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:41.500
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Bryan Fogel,</v>

872
00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:46.501
<v Speaker 3>he's the director of the producer of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie and he was competitive bike racer</v>

873
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 3>and he decided to document what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do was compete in a race,</v>

874
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.040
<v Speaker 3>a bike race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred percent clean,</v>

875
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.700
<v Speaker 3>and then get a Russian scientist to</v>
<v Speaker 3>juice them up.</v>

876
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.630
<v Speaker 3>So in the process of getting this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian scientists to juice them up,</v>

877
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 3>he stumbled upon a scandal and in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of him making that,</v>

878
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.190
<v Speaker 3>but it means in a crazy way because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian guy is the head of the Anti</v>

879
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Doping Agency in Russia and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of informing him how you would do</v>

880
00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:17.260
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

881
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Speaker 3>So he teaches him and forms of how you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do this.</v>

882
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:24.010
<v Speaker 3>While this is all going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that the Russians had</v>

883
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:29.011
<v Speaker 3>completely cheated their way through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sochi Olympics now and it was all</v>

884
00:38:29.381 --> 00:38:31.630
<v Speaker 3>documented and so they were getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>busted.</v>

885
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>As this is all going on and he films</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Russian who's the head of it,</v>

886
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 3>escaping Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely coming to the United States and</v>

887
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:45.181
<v Speaker 3>being chased and testifying all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different strategies that the Russians</v>

888
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:50.281
<v Speaker 3>used in order to completely cheat on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at least one entire Olympic team,</v>

889
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 3>like every single athlete was on drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had a record number of gold</v>

890
00:38:55.721 --> 00:39:00.721
<v Speaker 3>medals and so then he starts detailing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process and how they did it and they</v>

891
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>use forensic test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>examined the urine bottles and showed</v>

892
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 3>that they've been opened even though</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were supposedly not openable and</v>

893
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting stuff,</v>

894
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.900
<v Speaker 3>but that national pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about a national pride and you</v>

895
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:16.421
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

896
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 3>the ability to win a bunch of gold</v>
<v Speaker 3>medals and athletic dominance is so</v>

897
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 3>important for the morale of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these countries that want to</v>

898
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 3>establish superiority,</v>

899
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

900
00:39:28.231 --> 00:39:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And there are some people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

901
00:39:29.851 --> 00:39:33.150
<v Speaker 2>let's just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's have the old dope Olympics.</v>

902
00:39:33.151 --> 00:39:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people enhance themselves as much</v>

903
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 2>as they possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an ongoing debate about what</v>

904
00:39:39.901 --> 00:39:42.180
<v Speaker 2>about people who use prosthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

905
00:39:42.181 --> 00:39:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you lost a leg and you have a</v>

906
00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:47.460
<v Speaker 2>prosthetic leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because could that potentially give you</v>

907
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:50.220
<v Speaker 2>an advantage in a running event or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

908
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:52.370
<v Speaker 2>If it were a sufficiently good</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosthetic eye?</v>

909
00:39:52.371 --> 00:39:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to any of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

910
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little bit weird because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we set up these arbitrary categories for</v>

911
00:39:58.981 --> 00:40:00.930
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sporting event and we invented them,</v>

912
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not out there in the world and</v>

913
00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Speaker 2>now we're faced with wholly different</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances to what to do about it,</v>

914
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.731
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

915
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

916
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.020
<v Speaker 2>There's the question of what we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

917
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:12.030
<v Speaker 2>which is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the question of what's going to</v>

918
00:40:12.031 --> 00:40:13.860
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is it's all going to happen.</v>

919
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are gonna happen.</v>

920
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a guy this past weekend</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a navy seal and his friend lost</v>

921
00:40:19.401 --> 00:40:24.401
<v Speaker 3>his hand and they gave him a new hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're working on this new handout</v>

922
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.760
<v Speaker 3>that's going to allow him to play piano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a completely artificial carbon</v>

923
00:40:30.951 --> 00:40:34.730
<v Speaker 3>fiber hand with all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that attach directly to your</v>

924
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 3>nerves and somehow or another he can</v>
<v Speaker 3>control it with</v>

925
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:41.510
<v Speaker 2>his arm that's going to allow him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play piano and you're going to tell me</v>

926
00:40:41.511 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 2>that he could never play the piano</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

927
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Right now he knows it's in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the thing.</v>

928
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:47.194
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what I was saying about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain computer interfaces.</v>

930
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:54.721
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's even bigger frontier than</v>

931
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 2>synthetic biology or genetic engineering</v>
<v Speaker 2>because computers are really useful for</v>

932
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robots are very useful for things.</v>

933
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are just going to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>blend in.</v>

934
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we're gonna have ai and</v>
<v Speaker 2>super healthy humans.</v>

935
00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna just have everywhere on that</v>

936
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.130
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

937
00:41:09.131 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm thinking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some sort of a</v>

938
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic thing like a chip or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried it with the Google glasses.</v>

939
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Could try to get people to wear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were goofy.</v>

940
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put them on.</v>

941
00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 2>They felt too science fictiony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the first portable phones were</v>

942
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:23.850
<v Speaker 2>these giant things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

943
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.710
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

944
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>That's not a longterm prognostication</v>
<v Speaker 2>tool.</v>

945
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of,</v>

946
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people are working on it.</v>

947
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Elan Musk has a little company that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one knows,</v>

948
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

949
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 1>as they do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

950
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know about it if they care,</v>

951
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like one of his famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

952
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

953
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to implant a neural lace or something in</v>

954
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 1>your body that reads your brain neuro</v>
<v Speaker 1>lace.</v>

955
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you want a more macho,</v>

956
00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.920
<v Speaker 1>wanted the back of your head to open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your schedule.</v>

957
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't think of it as I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of it as like a mesh.</v>

958
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

959
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems creepy that it's going to</v>

960
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.650
<v Speaker 1>latch onto your nerves and improve you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

961
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Neuro lace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't need your phone anymore.</v>

962
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where's you went to the back of your</v>

963
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 1>head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone goes to the back of their head</v>

964
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.393
<v Speaker 1>will always go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

965
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

966
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.300
<v Speaker 1>like the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody goes to the back of their</v>

967
00:42:19.301 --> 00:42:20.134
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

969
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that want to make money in the</v>

970
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 1>short term are building these</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsurgical,</v>

971
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 1>noninvasive things we like were</v>
<v Speaker 1>something on the front of your head or</v>

972
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.230
<v Speaker 1>wear a cap or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can detect frequencies,</v>

973
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 1>vibrations in your brain and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very primitive,</v>

974
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 1>but you can move things around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can control drones with your brain</v>

975
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 1>without touching anything.</v>

976
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

977
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it ever becomes practical,</v>

978
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 1>which is very far from certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing to imagine in the far</v>

979
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:52.700
<v Speaker 1>outside fiction scenario is cracking</v>
<v Speaker 1>open your skull and inserting some</v>

980
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 1>electrodes in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closing it back up.</v>

981
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And now you're part of the Super</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet without doing anything more</v>

982
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:00.400
<v Speaker 1>than closing your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And there's also the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing various,</v>

984
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought processes to with transdermal</v>

985
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:09.040
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they could figure out,</v>

986
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that now they're,</v>

987
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 1>they've performed a series of tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have people do like certain</v>

988
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:20.171
<v Speaker 1>tasks and then they put electrodes in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain areas of the brain and put an</v>

989
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 1>electric charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that electric charge stimulates</v>

990
00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 1>various aspects of the brain and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows them to complete certain tasks</v>

991
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 1>quicker and more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

992
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just a kind of uninformed a</v>

993
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that the human brain is</v>

994
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>pretty optimized for what it tries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

995
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that rather than improving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brainers,</v>

996
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 1>stimulating it the way forward is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>augment it,</v>

997
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.330
<v Speaker 1>like hook it up to calculators and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and whatever.</v>

998
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I don't see talked about</v>

999
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 1>very much but I think will be a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>game changer.</v>

1000
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about phones as if we're</v>

1001
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 1>carrying around phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't mostly use our phones to</v>

1002
00:43:58.071 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 1>talk to people on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1003
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>We check the email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check the internet and we take pictures</v>

1004
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 1>once you really have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again it might not be possible,</v>

1005
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 1>but if you really had a direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between your brain and the</v>

1006
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyeballs are a video camera.</v>

1007
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can record and store somewhere,</v>

1008
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1009
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And you can lend them to other people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can subpoena them or whatever.</v>

1010
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Like there's literally no place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that,</v>

1011
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 1>that human eyeballs are looking at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be subject to later</v>

1012
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Speaker 1>inspection.</v>

1013
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.140
<v Speaker 1>That is weird and scary and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1014
00:44:33.141 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 1>It is words carrying bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what if someone comes up with a</v>

1015
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:37.190
<v Speaker 1>better eyeball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1016
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Scoop out your old doll eyes and put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new awesome ones that you can</v>

1017
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 1>record with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that a nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1020
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I think I absolutely agree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing it with electronics is</v>

1021
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 1>probably the way to go and that having</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of,</v>

1022
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 1>some sort of symbiotic relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics.</v>

1023
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that this transdermal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation can enhance that process on</v>

1024
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 1>top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a bunch of</v>

1025
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 1>different things going on at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even think about crispr being</v>

1026
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 1>something where someone eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures out a way to design various</v>

1027
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:17.061
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the human brain that are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to interface with technology,</v>

1028
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.340
<v Speaker 1>changing various receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them more efficient for data to go</v>

1029
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 1>straight to the dome.</v>

1030
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

1031
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a short term versus long term</v>

1032
00:45:26.881 --> 00:45:27.631
<v Speaker 1>question here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1033
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Like even if what I said is a longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth on the short term,</v>

1034
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 1>improving our thinking skills in direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways with stimulation or whatever sounds</v>

1035
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can just do that through</v>

1036
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Beta blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some drugs or something like</v>

1037
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that that's another thing,</v>

1038
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.710
<v Speaker 1>very plausible that will have safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>superefficient drugs.</v>

1039
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Someone can take it over the next six</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

1040
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 1>their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clear thinkers than they were before.</v>

1041
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Is there any concern with what's the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>game like what's all this stuff?</v>

1042
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1043
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.600
<v Speaker 1>if you're a super far advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end game is you realize that life is</v>

1044
00:46:01.601 --> 00:46:04.540
<v Speaker 1>not that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why am I here?</v>

1046
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing with all this little</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge is helpful actually.</v>

1047
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Well in particular if you develop a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality,</v>

1048
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no concern about getting</v>

1049
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:17.320
<v Speaker 1>injured or killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that people who envision super</v>
<v Speaker 1>far ahead science fiction scenarios and</v>

1051
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:28.431
<v Speaker 1>especially people who envision uploading</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains and consciousness underestimate</v>

1052
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 1>the importance of our bodies to who we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are as human beings,</v>

1053
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just that we're in a body,</v>

1054
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but like hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>

1055
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.190
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being horny,</v>

1056
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.900
<v Speaker 1>like these are motivating factors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really affect who we are and what we say</v>

1057
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 1>and what we do and if you remove all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1058
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're just a thinking processor in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

1059
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 1>what's your motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you going on?</v>

1060
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing anything at all?</v>

1061
00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think it'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will be anything like</v>

1062
00:46:57.391 --> 00:46:59.490
<v Speaker 1>the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who you are.</v>

1063
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 1>If your body is taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big question about artificial</v>

1064
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:03.631
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1065
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:08.631
<v Speaker 1>Our or artificial intelligence rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we have very specific needs</v>

1066
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Speaker 1>that are addressed by our ambitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1067
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Biological need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of transferring your genes,</v>

1068
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:18.920
<v Speaker 1>keeping your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bloodline,</v>

1069
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1070
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>There's all these survival instincts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have that you necessarily</v>

1071
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.070
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't necessarily have if you are an</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial life form.</v>

1072
00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you care if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled the plug on you?</v>

1073
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Why would you try to</v>

1074
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 3>survive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>

1075
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 3>What's your purpose here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1076
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Exact same sort of futile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>

1077
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of talk in the Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a existential risk community,</v>

1078
00:47:38.521 --> 00:47:40.380
<v Speaker 2>like worrying about artificial</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1079
00:47:40.381 --> 00:47:45.180
<v Speaker 2>about value alignment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like making sure that the ais value the</v>

1080
00:47:45.181 --> 00:47:47.970
<v Speaker 2>same things that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like our existence for example,</v>

1081
00:47:47.971 --> 00:47:48.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a little bit,</v>

1083
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:52.620
<v Speaker 2>at least what I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not an expert,</v>

1084
00:47:52.621 --> 00:47:56.820
<v Speaker 2>but I hear it seems a little bit off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark because they're talking about what</v>

1085
00:47:56.821 --> 00:48:01.821
<v Speaker 2>to program into the AI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's in any sense really an ai,</v>

1086
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:04.530
<v Speaker 2>it can reprogram itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1087
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:06.840
<v Speaker 2>You can change your mind as a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

1088
00:48:06.841 --> 00:48:09.570
<v Speaker 2>You can change your values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can change your motivations.</v>

1089
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence is should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do the same thing and in fact</v>

1090
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.890
<v Speaker 2>they better be able to do that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be truly intelligent.</v>

1091
00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:18.480
<v Speaker 2>If they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to mimic what a human</v>

1092
00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:19.820
<v Speaker 2>being can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1093
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.050
<v Speaker 2>it can't be something where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>programmed them,</v>

1094
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.240
<v Speaker 2>just do a task because that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

1095
00:48:24.241 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that happens there,</v>

1096
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.970
<v Speaker 2>then you know who knows what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to eventually be motivated to do.</v>

1097
00:48:29.971 --> 00:48:31.110
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1098
00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>like what is their motivation even to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything at all or even to exist?</v>

1099
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the big concerns is that in</v>

1100
00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:41.700
<v Speaker 3>releasing artificial technology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving it autonomy that we're going to</v>

1101
00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:46.701
<v Speaker 3>do is like start a process that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a perpetual exponential domino</v>

1102
00:48:49.981 --> 00:48:54.981
<v Speaker 3>effect of technology where this new</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial life is going to create</v>

1103
00:48:54.991 --> 00:48:58.140
<v Speaker 3>better artificial life which creates</v>
<v Speaker 3>better artificial life,</v>

1104
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.200
<v Speaker 3>which expands to godlike powers within a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very short period of time and decides</v>

1105
00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:08.070
<v Speaker 3>where he's stupid and useless and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminates us and then it gets bored and</v>

1106
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:08.940
<v Speaker 3>shuts itself off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.990
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing here?</v>

1108
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.170
<v Speaker 3>The Sun's going to burn out and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>are hard</v>

1109
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 2>things to even extrapolate because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so far beyond our experience,</v>

1110
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:21.731
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that we're opening up</v>
<v Speaker 2>doors that we never had before.</v>

1111
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Between between a genetic modifications</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human beings,</v>

1112
00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:28.130
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain computer interfaces,</v>

1113
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1114
00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the experience or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to really even ask the right</v>

1115
00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:34.730
<v Speaker 2>questions about these things.</v>

1116
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're sort of rudimentary.</v>

1117
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Early were rudimentary idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that we have of like what is</v>

1118
00:49:43.591 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>necessary or really based on our own</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological needs.</v>

1119
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.730
<v Speaker 3>We have family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to keep everybody healthy,</v>

1120
00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>we enjoy our community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to keep it safe.</v>

1121
00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.480
<v Speaker 3>We enjoy our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our earth who want to keep it clean.</v>

1122
00:49:57.481 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 3>We want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to save things for the future</v>

1123
00:50:00.661 --> 00:50:04.710
<v Speaker 3>generations and all these concerns that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have that are very biological,</v>

1124
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.380
<v Speaker 3>they just won't exist for artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1125
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.250
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what we're really good</v>

1126
00:50:10.251 --> 00:50:13.850
<v Speaker 2>at or what we're better at in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagining the future is taking what</v>

1127
00:50:13.851 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 2>already exists and just expanding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1128
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when people.</v>

1129
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that maybe you talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last podcast,</v>

1130
00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:24.860
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people first started imagining</v>

1131
00:50:24.861 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 2>mechanical devices to carry you around</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical transportation in the late 18</v>

1132
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they imagined a mechanical horse cause</v>

1133
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>they knew the horse has existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1134
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 2>And the car was a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and people hadn't thought of that</v>

1135
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 2>originally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people did think of cars,</v>

1136
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 2>they thought of flying cars because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved there were flying animals,</v>

1137
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the flying cars haven't appeared</v>

1138
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 2>because w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we didn't what they should have been</v>

1139
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are cars going to change our cities</v>

1140
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and our commutes and how we live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1141
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people invented the Internet that</v>

1142
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:54.570
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't sure what they were going</v>

1143
00:50:54.571 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 2>to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the same thing is true</v>

1144
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:57.734
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1145
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 2>if we can imagine blending the barrier</v>
<v Speaker 2>between our biological existence in some</v>

1146
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 2>virtual existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know what questions to ask</v>

1147
00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1148
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we are getting close to</v>

1149
00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:10.230
<v Speaker 3>those other things that you mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1150
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Boston dynamics is getting really close</v>
<v Speaker 3>to artificial dogs and artificial</v>

1151
00:51:15.481 --> 00:51:16.740
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1152
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 3>they have things that you can't kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kick them and they,</v>

1153
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.900
<v Speaker 3>they don't get knocked over and open</v>
<v Speaker 3>doors.</v>

1154
00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can jump like incredible distances,</v>

1155
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.830
<v Speaker 3>incredible heights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1156
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.920
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some amazing ones that do</v>

1157
00:51:28.921 --> 00:51:31.350
<v Speaker 3>acrobatics now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen that where they're going to</v>

1158
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:36.270
<v Speaker 3>replace stuntman in movies that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially get harmed with these robots</v>

1159
00:51:36.271 --> 00:51:41.040
<v Speaker 3>that can do crazy back flips and jump</v>
<v Speaker 3>off buildings and the next big war is</v>

1160
00:51:41.041 --> 00:51:43.410
<v Speaker 3>going to look very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than very weird.</v>

1161
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1162
00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.280
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it won't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it does,</v>

1163
00:51:47.281 --> 00:51:48.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna.</v>

1164
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.750
<v Speaker 3>There's a big emphasis on automated</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1165
00:51:51.751 --> 00:51:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Not just drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but physical things that are running</v>

1166
00:51:55.501 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 3>around on the grass and make decisions</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1167
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Give it a little bit of Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

1168
00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch dark mirror?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1169
00:52:01.531 --> 00:52:02.331
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1170
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:06.300
<v Speaker 3>does it make in my queue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an insane episode on.</v>

1171
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one with Black Mirror,</v>

1172
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.290
<v Speaker 3>black mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a dark mirror.</v>

1173
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Black Mirror is insane episode on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>little robots that are chasing metal</v>

1174
00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:19.080
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metal head,</v>

1175
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.640
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.960
<v Speaker 3>it's about a robots chasing after this</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady.</v>

1177
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it literally is these little tiny Boston</v>

1178
00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:31.620
<v Speaker 3>dynamic robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can kill you and they're there</v>

1179
00:52:31.621 --> 00:52:35.430
<v Speaker 3>on a mission and this is not outside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>realm of possibility at all.</v>

1180
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1181
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

1182
00:52:37.951 --> 00:52:39.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know.</v>

1183
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to extrapolate right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ordered the Sarah differences.</v>

1184
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:45.263
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1185
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.020
<v Speaker 3>That's from the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fantastic episode two.</v>

1186
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.120
<v Speaker 3>There's so many good episodes of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1187
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Black Mirror is just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:52:53.041 --> 00:52:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I guess start watched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1189
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.400
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a concern.</v>

1190
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real concern.</v>

1191
00:52:58.051 --> 00:53:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing it right now with drones,</v>

1192
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to people that are really,</v>

1193
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 3>that have paid attention to studied</v>
<v Speaker 3>drone warfare and how incredibly</v>

1194
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.980
<v Speaker 3>inhumane it is and how different it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>from any other type of warfare in terms</v>

1195
00:53:13.981 --> 00:53:18.981
<v Speaker 3>of is like the ability to rationalize</v>
<v Speaker 3>targets when you're not there yet.</v>

1196
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.580
<v Speaker 3>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

1197
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you're nowhere near and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressing buttons and you decide</v>

1198
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 1>like little bell does a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

1199
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 1>This person's in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1200
00:53:30.361 --> 00:53:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Nuke the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing that.</v>

1202
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely happening.</v>

1203
00:53:34.171 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drones are also delivering pizzas.</v>

1204
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Are they though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a pizza with a drone thing.</v>

1205
00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you looked at the amount of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have delivered pizzas with drones</v>

1206
00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 1>versus the amount of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been killed by drones,</v>

1207
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.280
<v Speaker 1>especially killing is bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1208
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:51.480
<v Speaker 1>the innocence of the scariest drones are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at killing innocent people.</v>

1209
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Not so good at killing the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are specific target targets.</v>

1210
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is just that,</v>

1211
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are going to be pluses and</v>

1212
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:00.504
<v Speaker 1>minuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1213
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So I think that it's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we,</v>

1214
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.140
<v Speaker 1>if we combine this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1215
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.980
<v Speaker 1>interfacing with computers with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of drones,</v>

1216
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:10.230
<v Speaker 1>doing some drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rework with this idea of giving people a</v>

1217
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 1>basic income.</v>

1218
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is just going to sit in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms and then write on their.</v>

1219
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Tumblr is all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna be the future.</v>

1220
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing anymore.</v>

1221
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:22.791
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a real possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to create virtual reality</v>

1222
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 1>that's indistinguishable from regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1223
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And people are going to live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like ready player,</v>

1224
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 1>one will be better kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the big flaw to me and</v>

1225
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 1>things like trauma and are ready player</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that they make the virtual</v>

1226
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 1>reality look too much like the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1227
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to have gravity.</v>

1228
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why it has to be three</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional.</v>

1229
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have any limit on how</v>

1230
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:47.010
<v Speaker 1>strong you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast you are,</v>

1231
00:54:47.011 --> 00:54:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1232
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.040
<v Speaker 1>like there's no reason why you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have only one body.</v>

1233
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a million different ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which it could be very,</v>

1234
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:52.771
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1235
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 1>it also can be implemented with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the tank,</v>

1236
00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the float tank that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier.</v>

1237
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could climb into that float</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank with some sort of apparatus.</v>

1238
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Hook these gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put this helmet over,</v>

1239
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 1>and literally not be subject to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whims of gravity.</v>

1240
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Effects of gravity will be</v>

1241
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>inconsequential because you will feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're floating.</v>

1242
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.250
<v Speaker 1>And then from there you'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly around.</v>

1243
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And do all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1244
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I think like this weird period between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 1>the year 1900 and 2000 or 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 or whatever it's going to be a,</v>

1246
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a weird transitional period in</v>
<v Speaker 1>human history where we invented</v>

1247
00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 1>technology and not really put it to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet and there might be some equilibrium</v>

1248
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:38.610
<v Speaker 1>that we reach and 100 or 200 years where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole mode of life is utterly</v>

1249
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:39.570
<v Speaker 1>different than what it is now.</v>

1250
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>If you could put priorities in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you think people should</v>

1251
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on first when in regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of stuff,</v>

1252
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>what do you think those would be like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said,</v>

1253
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Shawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a super smart dude.</v>

1254
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1255
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>let's get on the ball here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what direction should we take</v>

1256
00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 1>this in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1257
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.080
<v Speaker 1>what I do for living is more like</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational.</v>

1258
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 1>What are the laws of physics kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1259
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not the person to speculate on</v>

1260
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.294
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1261
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1262
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I said earlier like I think</v>

1263
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>we should be talking to each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody is,</v>

1264
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.150
<v Speaker 1>no one person is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why we need to have people</v>

1265
00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:19.680
<v Speaker 1>from different areas of expertise talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about each other's areas if only then to</v>

1266
00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:20.790
<v Speaker 1>be corrected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1267
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.560
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be open to that dialogue.</v>

1268
00:56:22.561 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think that for example,</v>

1269
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.270
<v Speaker 2>an enormous amount of effort has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>put into nanotechnology building tiny</v>

1270
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 2>little machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that mostly the real,</v>

1271
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advances,</v>

1272
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:35.250
<v Speaker 2>they are not going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>nanotechnology,</v>

1273
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but in synthetic biology where you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria are multicellular organisms</v>

1274
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>that already exists and adapt them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your purposes,</v>

1275
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 2>make them do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because biology has already solved a lot</v>

1276
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 2>of the problems that a technology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>still struggling to figure out.</v>

1277
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So the concept of nanotechnologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to take like almost like a</v>

1278
00:56:51.321 --> 00:56:53.090
<v Speaker 3>cell sized machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1279
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:58.160
<v Speaker 3>And many of them going to go into your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body and find areas that are damaged or</v>

1280
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:04.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a professor at Caltech who gave a talk a</v>

1282
00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.990
<v Speaker 2>few months ago about tea builds robots</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of DNA,</v>

1283
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 2>so they're these little DNA robots can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go in and right now they're at the level</v>

1284
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:15.900
<v Speaker 2>where what they can do is sort thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if they have a molecule one and</v>

1285
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:18.030
<v Speaker 2>molecule to scattered across some</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

1286
00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.120
<v Speaker 2>this little DNA robot will go in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all molecule one to the left,</v>

1287
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:26.121
<v Speaker 2>all of molecule due to the right and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says that's the beginning.</v>

1288
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Like in the future you'll have your</v>
<v Speaker 2>little DNA box and you'll say,</v>

1289
00:57:29.371 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm allergic to tomatoes,</v>

1290
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.460
<v Speaker 2>and then it will invent a little machine</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will run through your body and fix</v>

1291
00:57:35.461 --> 00:57:36.920
<v Speaker 2>your allergy tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1292
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that anymore with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine with a DNA robots.</v>

1293
00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why DNA,</v>

1294
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>because you think of DNA is carrying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic code,</v>

1295
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:50.631
<v Speaker 2>but DNA is a wonderful molecule because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is relatively stable,</v>

1296
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just a crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1297
00:57:52.321 --> 00:57:54.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not just doing the same thing over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

1298
00:57:54.241 --> 00:57:57.540
<v Speaker 2>So it contains information and it can</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapt.</v>

1299
00:57:57.541 --> 00:57:58.201
<v Speaker 2>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can,</v>

1300
00:57:58.201 --> 00:57:59.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1301
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.250
<v Speaker 2>hold on and grab onto certain things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let go and,</v>

1302
00:58:02.251 --> 00:58:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So DNA is a wonderful testing ground for</v>

1303
00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:09.510
<v Speaker 2>building little really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tiny things in your body that</v>

1304
00:58:09.511 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 2>will change who you are.</v>

1305
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question that's not totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>related,</v>

1306
00:58:13.191 --> 00:58:18.191
<v Speaker 3>but you might be a good person for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is quantum computing now?</v>

1307
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:24.080
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I keep hearing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the big breakthroughs in,</v>

1308
00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.680
<v Speaker 3>in computers is going to be quantum</v>
<v Speaker 3>computing,</v>

1309
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.543
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1310
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost the right guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not completed the color.</v>

1311
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I actually did teach a course at Caltech</v>
<v Speaker 2>that involve quantum computing.</v>

1312
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So I'm above average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely the best,</v>

1313
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1314
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so quantum mechanics,</v>

1315
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.390
<v Speaker 2>this is the book that I'm writing right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1316
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gonna be a year from now called</v>

1317
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 2>something deeply hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be about quantum mechanics and the</v>

1318
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 2>goal of the book will be to make quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics understandable to everybody</v>

1319
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and convinced them that quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics really does imply the</v>

1320
00:58:53.981 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>existence of multiple worlds where</v>
<v Speaker 2>things look very much the same except</v>

1321
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:00.270
<v Speaker 2>for tiny differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one way of thinking that will</v>

1322
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics says is in classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>

1323
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:04.720
<v Speaker 2>which is what came before quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics.</v>

1324
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine you have a bit right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is something is either zero or one</v>

1325
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One piece of information.</v>

1326
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 2>In quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a quantum bit accubid as they</v>

1327
00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 2>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clever.</v>

1328
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.320
<v Speaker 2>So the difference is that instead of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a zero or a one,</v>

1329
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 2>like it would be classically quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanically,</v>

1330
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.510
<v Speaker 2>it is in some super position of zero and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and some combination of a little bit</v>

1331
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit one.</v>

1332
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that you don't know which</v>
<v Speaker 2>one it is,</v>

1333
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:34.730
<v Speaker 2>it's that it really is both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be 90 percent zero and 10</v>

1334
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:39.731
<v Speaker 2>percent one or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take that fact number one fact number</v>

1335
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 2>two is the quantum mechanics has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing called entanglement,</v>

1336
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 2>which means that if you have two bits</v>
<v Speaker 2>classically,</v>

1337
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 2>so you have zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1338
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:49.311
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1339
00:59:49.311 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 2>one zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1340
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four different possibilities.</v>

1341
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 2>So quantum mechanics says it's not that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one bit is in a combination of zero</v>

1342
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 2>and one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this other bit is also in a</v>

1343
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:03.620
<v Speaker 2>combination of zero and one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that the two bit system is in a</v>

1344
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 2>combination of zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1345
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:06.621
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1346
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>one zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one one,</v>

1347
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1348
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So it might be that it's 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1349
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 2>zero and 50 percent one one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know what either bit is,</v>

1350
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>but he know they're the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1351
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's entanglement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take these two ideas that you</v>

1352
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.060
<v Speaker 2>have a combination of Zeros and ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than just one or the other and</v>

1353
01:00:23.061 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 2>the different bits can be entangled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1354
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>And then you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what is a computer?</v>

1355
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.600
<v Speaker 2>A computer is something that takes bits</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1356
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 2>does manipulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and spits out the answer,</v>

1357
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You solve problems,</v>

1358
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.390
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's literally going on.</v>

1359
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And your computer as a bunch of zeroes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ones being pushed around.</v>

1360
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.670
<v Speaker 2>So a quantum computer is pushing out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of cubits,</v>

1361
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of spinning particles or something</v>

1362
01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:45.440
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spin of a particle that can either</v>

1363
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>be spinning clockwise or</v>
<v Speaker 2>counterclockwise is a cupid,</v>

1364
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>and so these particles can interact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

1365
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>they can become entangled and you invent</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quantum algorithm,</v>

1366
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1367
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Like there's algorithms for finding the</v>
<v Speaker 2>area of a surface or something like</v>

1368
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Factoring large numbers,</v>

1369
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving the shortest distance between</v>

1370
01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>two different points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do this using the rules of</v>

1371
01:01:08.151 --> 01:01:11.780
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics instead of the rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>of classical mechanics and the belief</v>

1372
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:13.970
<v Speaker 2>which is not yet 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>established,</v>

1373
01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>but we think is true is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>some problems that are really,</v>

1374
01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>really hard to solve for a classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1375
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>which means that you can easily make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem long enough that it would take</v>

1376
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 2>the lifetime of the universe to solve it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a classical computer which quantum</v>

1377
01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:30.770
<v Speaker 2>computers can solve quite quickly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently.</v>

1378
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>

1379
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>we haven't proven that it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematically why.</v>

1380
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Why would they think that quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers will be able to solve it</v>

1381
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>quicker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more information in the quantum</v>

1382
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have two bits,</v>

1383
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.970
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1384
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:44.331
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1385
01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:44.840
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1386
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 2>There's only four things that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>right if you have a quantum computer is</v>

1387
01:01:48.411 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of things it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's any combination of those</v>

1388
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:53.150
<v Speaker 2>four things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1389
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Ten percent this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent that.</v>

1390
01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So There's like a continuum of</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

1391
01:01:57.441 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's analog rather than digital in some</v>

1392
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.840
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you,</v>

1393
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.720
<v Speaker 2>what you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1394
01:02:02.721 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quantum computer can just sort of</v>

1395
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.750
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of that extra power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1396
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:10.130
<v Speaker 2>to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1397
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:12.100
<v Speaker 2>because of this entanglement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what this is,</v>

1398
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.050
<v Speaker 2>this is I'm going to get in trouble with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my quantum computing friends because not</v>

1399
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 2>quite fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but roughly speaking rather than</v>

1400
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>manipulating bit by bit because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entanglement between the bits.</v>

1401
01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>The quantum computer can move all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bits a little bit at once.</v>

1402
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.110
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're searching for something in the</v>

1403
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:28.711
<v Speaker 2>list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1404
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>A very elementary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a computer science program is,</v>

1405
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you a list.</v>

1406
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>find an element that is equal to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain number,</v>

1407
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds easy,</v>

1408
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>but if that list is 10 trillion things</v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

1409
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:40.344
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1410
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So what the quantum computer can do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1411
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:47.590
<v Speaker 2>take every element in the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nudge it a little bit towards zero if</v>

1412
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>it's the wrong answer in towards one if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the right answer and you don't know</v>

1413
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>where it is in the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can do that nudging over and</v>

1414
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

1415
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you look for where's the one it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to find so you can get the answer</v>

1416
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>much quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is believed.</v>

1417
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 2>and so things like cryptography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>privacy,</v>

1418
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 2>right or dramatically changed by this</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if one of the things that we</v>

1419
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 2>think quantum computers should be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do faster is factor large numbers,</v>

1420
01:03:13.051 --> 01:03:14.330
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1421
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 2>the difficulty in factoring large</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers is the basis for much modern</v>

1422
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 2>cryptography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1423
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.910
<v Speaker 2>but also simulating systems that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just too difficult to simulate,</v>

1424
01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:24.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1425
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.520
<v Speaker 2>just took too much computer power to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1426
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe we can do it because nature is</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly quantum mechanical.</v>

1427
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 2>At the core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out to be very hard because the</v>

1428
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:35.670
<v Speaker 2>problem is you have all these bits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you touch one of them,</v>

1429
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 2>if the outside world bumps into one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1430
01:03:37.771 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cosmic ray or adam hits it,</v>

1431
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:43.080
<v Speaker 2>the whole entanglement is ruined between</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1432
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very delicate and that's what the,</v>

1433
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you know right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1434
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working on systems of let's say</v>

1435
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>dozens of cubits entangled at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>

1436
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you would like it to be way more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you can store an enormous</v>

1437
01:03:57.541 --> 01:04:00.360
<v Speaker 2>amount of information in these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1438
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 2>if it works as I think it'll be way</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at computing if it works.</v>

1439
01:04:05.701 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all sure that quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers will be efficient or cost</v>

1440
01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:12.180
<v Speaker 2>effective or anything like that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>near term.</v>

1441
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.970
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing computations faster or something</v>

1442
01:04:14.971 --> 01:04:18.120
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of people wouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do so right now they're working with</v>

1443
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>dozens of cubits and what's preventing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them from expanding that or they're</v>

1444
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 2>doing it slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of make sure that it all works</v>

1445
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 2>correctly and get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accurate model.</v>

1446
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is if you had a cubit,</v>

1447
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 2>it can be in a combination of zero or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1448
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any combination whatsoever,</v>

1449
01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never see the combination.</v>

1450
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:41.880
<v Speaker 2>You see zero or you see one that's it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've ruined.</v>

1451
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:44.730
<v Speaker 2>You've erased this preexisting</v>
<v Speaker 2>combination.</v>

1452
01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 2>If you see zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's in the state zero c one,</v>

1453
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>it's in the state one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a group of many,</v>

1454
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>many cubits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean by look at is literally</v>

1455
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 2>anything else in the world bumping into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1456
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.600
<v Speaker 2>So like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1457
01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:59.520
<v Speaker 2>if photons headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if particles,</v>

1458
01:04:59.521 --> 01:04:59.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1459
01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if molecules of air and oxygen or</v>

1460
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:07.200
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen bump into the cubit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll count as an observation and it</v>

1461
01:05:07.201 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 2>will collapse as we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it collapses the wave function and then</v>

1462
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.300
<v Speaker 2>all of your quantum information is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined.</v>

1463
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1464
01:05:13.781 --> 01:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you have to make them a sort of very</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

1465
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 2>very isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very from external influences.</v>

1466
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:22.290
<v Speaker 2>And the more cubits you add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the harder that is to do well.</v>

1467
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there a proof of concept this?</v>

1468
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have working quantum computers.</v>

1469
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a joke.</v>

1470
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Scott aaronson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a friend of mine who's a genius,</v>

1471
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>a theoretical computer scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to joke that the quantum</v>

1472
01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>computers are able to say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number 15 is equal to five times three</v>

1473
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>with very high probability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the state of the art.</v>

1474
01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I think they're able to say that 21</v>
<v Speaker 2>equals three times seven with very high</v>

1475
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>probability now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1476
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would like to say is,</v>

1477
01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some hundred digit number is the product</v>

1478
01:05:51.731 --> 01:05:53.950
<v Speaker 2>of two other numbers not able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1479
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they looking at with this and</v>

1480
01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.930
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're looking at in terms of the</v>

1481
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>

1482
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they want to implement this?</v>

1483
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Lots of different ways actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the actual physical technology that</v>

1484
01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 2>they're using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are using adam's,</v>

1485
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.260
<v Speaker 2>some people are using sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1486
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:16.750
<v Speaker 2>features of condensed matter systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two dimensional systems where</v>

1487
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 2>electrons are moving slowly and can wind</v>
<v Speaker 2>around each other and things like that.</v>

1488
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.960
<v Speaker 2>ThiS is way beyond what I actually know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1489
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>but also this sort of side light of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that this existence of entanglement,</v>

1490
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a shared information</v>

1491
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:31.990
<v Speaker 2>between two different things.</v>

1492
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 2>In a way that classical physics just</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not allow,</v>

1493
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 2>and that's interesting and exciting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it opens up ways,</v>

1494
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1495
01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.320
<v Speaker 2>for sharing information that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can't get to because you have</v>

1496
01:06:44.321 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 2>some information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your friend has some information,</v>

1497
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1498
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 2>you need both pieces of it to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1499
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm seth lloyd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's another friend of mine at mit,</v>

1500
01:06:52.661 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 2>professor said that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells a story where he was in a hot</v>

1501
01:06:56.561 --> 01:07:01.390
<v Speaker 2>tub with the google guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right with sergey and larry and you</v>

1502
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:02.710
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heads of google,</v>

1503
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 2>the founders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1504
01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up with this brilliant new idea</v>

1505
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>where we can use quantum mechanics build</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quantum computer so that a person who</v>

1506
01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:14.800
<v Speaker 2>does a search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a google search using this quantum</v>

1507
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do a search and they can get</v>

1508
01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 2>their answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is literally impossible for</v>

1509
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>anyone else to ever know what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>searched for.</v>

1510
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And the google guys are like very</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited and they went away.</v>

1511
01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:26.320
<v Speaker 2>The next day they came back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1512
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 2>we realized this is the opposite of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>business model.</v>

1513
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really important to us that we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's right.</v>

1514
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google ads,</v>

1515
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.000
<v Speaker 2>google ad sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to another website,</v>

1516
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>it's shows you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1517
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.090
<v Speaker 2>sean's been looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:07:43.091 --> 01:07:47.530
<v Speaker 2>lenovo laptops and they follow you</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and all your other devices,</v>

1519
01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>your cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creepy.</v>

1520
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.020
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so In quantum in quantum computing is</v>

1521
01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:54.970
<v Speaker 2>there's quantum money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's quantum cryptography,</v>

1522
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>there's quantum eavesdropping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1523
01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1524
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to speculate about.</v>

1525
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I would not say the actual technology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very far advanced right now,</v>

1526
01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>but I can't tell you how quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't someone like google just</v>

1527
01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 2>have to adjust?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because prior to these google ads,</v>

1528
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>you'd never really knew what someone was</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in unless they took</v>

1529
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 3>surveys or unless they had purchasing</v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

1530
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 3>are there had to be some way that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could now that just detecting off of</v>

1531
01:08:23.601 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 3>searches and that's what their business</v>
<v Speaker 3>model is.</v>

1532
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean they can't come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a better new business model.</v>

1533
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 3>They will have to adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are not in the business of</v>

1534
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.480
<v Speaker 3>making that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No stAte now.</v>

1535
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>It's so effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were really smart,</v>

1536
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 3>they would have given $100,000 and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't tell no one about this ever</v>

1537
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that enough?</v>

1538
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found out what the stormy daniels</v>

1539
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That hundred thousand dollars doesn't</v>

1540
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 3>buy a lot of two thirds of a stormy</v>
<v Speaker 3>daniel.</v>

1541
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 3>What do you think they'll like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What will be the first way they try to</v>

1542
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>use something like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to use quantum computing.</v>

1543
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1544
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:01.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1545
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 2>the people who are really interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>now are,</v>

1546
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nsa in the dod,</v>

1547
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A national security agency and the</v>

1548
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 2>department of defense because secret</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages are the most obvious thing.</v>

1549
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm cracking codes and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the killer app that we know</v>

1550
01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:18.320
<v Speaker 2>about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a physicist.</v>

1551
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you use it to simulate quantum</v>

1552
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:23.600
<v Speaker 2>mechanical systems to learn about other</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior materials,</v>

1553
01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you will build a better super</v>
<v Speaker 2>conductor or something like that right</v>

1554
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll do better designing of your</v>

1555
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 2>genetically engineered dna on a quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

1556
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's sort of the generic thought</v>

1557
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 2>that you'll be able to do computations</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

1558
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:39.470
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's more specific things like</v>

1559
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 2>if the system you're trying to simulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>is itself quantum mechanical than</v>

1560
01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 2>simulating it on a quantum computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be the way to go.</v>

1561
01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To most people that just were woo right</v>

1562
01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 3>over their head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1563
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.150
<v Speaker 3>what are these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The quantum is so weird.</v>

1564
01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that you said</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

1565
01:09:56.011 --> 01:09:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking about quantum,</v>

1566
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about worlds that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar but with very small</v>

1567
01:10:02.701 --> 01:10:03.740
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1568
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1569
01:10:05.071 --> 01:10:06.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1570
01:10:06.061 --> 01:10:08.020
<v Speaker 3>I forget whether we talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>last time.</v>

1571
01:10:08.021 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1572
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.650
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this whole version of</v>

1573
01:10:10.651 --> 01:10:11.431
<v Speaker 2>quantum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let me,</v>

1574
01:10:11.431 --> 01:10:12.410
<v Speaker 2>let me back up because we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1575
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.313
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1576
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Quantum mechanics is weird because among</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things it is by far the most</v>

1577
01:10:18.031 --> 01:10:20.430
<v Speaker 2>successful theory of physics ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>invented.</v>

1578
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.950
<v Speaker 2>We've tested it to enormous precision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1579
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.770
<v Speaker 2>There's zero evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quantum mechanics is in any way not</v>

1580
01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:27.900
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't understand it.</v>

1581
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.210
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not just people in the street</v>

1582
01:10:30.211 --> 01:10:33.750
<v Speaker 2>like professional physicists don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what quantum mechanics says,</v>

1583
01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>so how do you practice it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1584
01:10:35.341 --> 01:10:37.980
<v Speaker 2>we have a recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a black box,</v>

1585
01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:38.721
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that I,</v>

1586
01:10:38.721 --> 01:10:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I put it in the book is imagine you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a website you could go to and you would</v>

1587
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:10:43.621 --> 01:10:46.200
<v Speaker 2>if I threw a ball with certain velocity</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain direction,</v>

1589
01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.060
<v Speaker 2>how far would it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it will give you the answer right</v>

1590
01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:49.120
<v Speaker 2>away depending upon.</v>

1591
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:49.953
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1592
01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Did you put all the details and it gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>you the answer.</v>

1593
01:10:52.021 --> 01:10:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Does that count as you knowing the laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>of physics,</v>

1594
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1595
01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You just have a black box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1596
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what quantum mechanics is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1597
01:10:58.651 --> 01:11:02.370
<v Speaker 2>If we set up an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say what the probability of every</v>

1598
01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>answer is going to be every outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you say,</v>

1599
01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:05.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1600
01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.740
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know,</v>

1601
01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>or we don't agree like different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with each other and so this</v>

1602
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>version of quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's different that try to answer</v>

1603
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 2>this question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on beneath the</v>

1604
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:17.731
<v Speaker 2>surface?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1605
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:22.350
<v Speaker 2>What's what's the deep down story of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and one of these stories is the</v>

1606
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:25.950
<v Speaker 2>many worlds interpretation of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and it was invented by a</v>

1607
01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 2>graduate student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever in the 19 fifties who was</v>

1608
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 2>instantly kicked out of physics because</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1609
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1610
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:36.801
<v Speaker 2>That is a long unglorious history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people trying to think deeply about</v>

1611
01:11:36.871 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics and being shunned in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community for doing so because we've</v>

1612
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>set up this weird thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1613
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 2>there was literally a memo that went</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the major physics journal.</v>

1614
01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>The United States said we will not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at papers that try to think about</v>

1615
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.430
<v Speaker 2>the foundations of quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1616
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 2>it's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

1617
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like we need to do like real work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shut up and calculate,</v>

1618
01:11:57.361 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to build bombs and things not</v>

1619
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 2>think about the nature of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very much antithetical</v>

1620
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:04.590
<v Speaker 2>to what physicists should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1621
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.350
<v Speaker 2>so many world says is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1622
01:12:07.351 --> 01:12:09.560
<v Speaker 2>so what we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we do talk about quantum mechanics,</v>

1623
01:12:09.561 --> 01:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but let's say we have a cube and we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spinning particle,</v>

1624
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:14.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this combination of spinning</v>

1625
01:12:14.671 --> 01:12:17.820
<v Speaker 2>clockwise and counterclockwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we call that the wave function.</v>

1626
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.880
<v Speaker 2>The wave function is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 10 percent clockwise,</v>

1627
01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 2>2090 percent counter clockwise or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1628
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:26.100
<v Speaker 2>So to every possible measurement</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome,</v>

1629
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you give me a number and that number is</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically how I figured out the</v>

1630
01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:31.710
<v Speaker 2>probability of that measurement outcome</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming true,</v>

1631
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's the wave function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there for a long time people thought,</v>

1632
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a trick.</v>

1633
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.470
<v Speaker 2>This is just like some it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it characterizes our inability to be</v>

1634
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:41.430
<v Speaker 2>precise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1635
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 2>We have a probability of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a probability of that,</v>

1636
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but someday they hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein,</v>

1637
01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had this hope that we'll have a better</v>

1638
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 2>theory and we'll know exactly how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict everything with perfect</v>

1639
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.120
<v Speaker 2>precision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever it says,</v>

1640
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.381
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1641
01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the other way around.</v>

1642
01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wave function is reality.</v>

1643
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1644
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a superposition.</v>

1645
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 2>The combination of all the different</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible outcomes.</v>

1646
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not any one outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as where the</v>

1647
01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>electron is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all spread out.</v>

1648
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the electron spinning,</v>

1649
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 2>you never see It as a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning clockwise and counterclockwise.</v>

1650
01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You always see one or the other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everett says,</v>

1651
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>that's because you have a wave function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live as a superposition of different</v>

1652
01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at the electron,</v>

1653
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:35.901
<v Speaker 2>what happens is before there was you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an electron and a combination</v>

1654
01:13:35.971 --> 01:13:40.470
<v Speaker 2>of counterclockwise and clockwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterward there is the electron was</v>

1655
01:13:40.471 --> 01:13:45.471
<v Speaker 2>spinning clockwise and spinning</v>
<v Speaker 2>clockwise plus that's 10 percent,</v>

1656
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 2>the 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The electron was spinning</v>

1657
01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 2>counterclockwise and you saw that</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning counterclockwise and both</v>

1658
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:53.880
<v Speaker 2>possibilities are real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're separate.</v>

1659
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>They've branched off from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone their own ways.</v>

1660
01:13:56.431 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>There's separate versions of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate copies of reality.</v>

1661
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's called the many worlds</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of quantum mechanics.</v>

1662
01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Possibilities is always a big feature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that people are</v>

1663
01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 2>constantly discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1664
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 2>What are the possibilities?</v>

1665
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Predicting the possIbilities and when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to human beings,</v>

1666
01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 3>this is also randomly discussed because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1667
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about determinism versus</v>

1668
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 3>freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talk about what are the,</v>

1669
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's created,</v>

1670
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 3>what are the possibilities that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>created as Sean Carroll and why?</v>

1671
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think the way you think and</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you going to say the next thing</v>

1672
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:35.170
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say and is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is biological,</v>

1673
01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is your life experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is information that's</v>

1674
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>dancing in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much are you interacting with me?</v>

1675
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:43.060
<v Speaker 3>The last thing that I've said to you.</v>

1676
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had a.</v>

1677
01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I was on the same harris's podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a long conversation about this</v>

1678
01:14:47.391 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 2>because he is very anti freewill and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that it's.</v>

1679
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with him but I don't care.</v>

1680
01:14:52.731 --> 01:14:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I think kind of boring to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he was born.</v>

1681
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's boring because here's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's boring because there's two</v>

1682
01:14:59.631 --> 01:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One question is how does the world work?</v>

1683
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And the other question is what words</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be attached to how the world</v>

1684
01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>works and the first one is interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second one is kind of boring.</v>

1685
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen seminar,</v>

1686
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I agree on how the world works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1687
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>But I am what philosophers call a</v>
<v Speaker 2>compatiblist when it comes to freewill,</v>

1688
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:17.960
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1689
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that I have some ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking my way into overcoming the laws</v>

1690
01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1691
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm made of atoms made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1692
01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.720
<v Speaker 2>particles that obey the laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I talk about myself as a large</v>

1693
01:15:32.121 --> 01:15:34.940
<v Speaker 2>collection of atoms and particles</v>
<v Speaker 2>obeying the laws of physics,</v>

1694
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.790
<v Speaker 2>then clearly there's no free will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just the solution to the</v>

1695
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:40.970
<v Speaker 2>equations and sometimes the wave</v>
<v Speaker 2>function branches and there's now two of</v>

1696
01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:42.350
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's whatever it is.</v>

1697
01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:46.880
<v Speaker 2>There's no spark of consciousness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lets me overcome what the equation site</v>

1698
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:49.010
<v Speaker 2>is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

1699
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:52.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not a fruitful way to go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life in terms of talking about</v>

1700
01:15:52.521 --> 01:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you meet somebody for the first</v>

1701
01:15:55.461 --> 01:15:56.520
<v Speaker 2>time and you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.680
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>

1703
01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't give you a list of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>atoms and say what every atom is doing</v>

1704
01:16:01.521 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let you let go ahead and solve for</v>

1705
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.390
<v Speaker 2>triggers equation to figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen next.</v>

1706
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell a story,</v>

1707
01:16:06.891 --> 01:16:09.950
<v Speaker 2>you say like you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you grew up in a certain place,</v>

1708
01:16:09.951 --> 01:16:11.390
<v Speaker 2>you have a certain jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1709
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You dramatically condense the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information about who you are into a few</v>

1710
01:16:16.821 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 2>salient points and among those salient</v>
<v Speaker 2>points are I am a person who thinks and</v>

1711
01:16:21.681 --> 01:16:24.350
<v Speaker 2>makes decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every person in the world,</v>

1712
01:16:24.351 --> 01:16:27.920
<v Speaker 2>no matter how anti-free will they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about people as if they make</v>

1713
01:16:27.921 --> 01:16:31.310
<v Speaker 2>decisions and the reason they do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how people are.</v>

1714
01:16:31.311 --> 01:16:33.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1715
01:16:33.051 --> 01:16:37.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not like just a compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you don't know the atoms and</v>

1716
01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:41.480
<v Speaker 2>molecules and somebody's body and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not infinitely computationally powerful,</v>

1717
01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.290
<v Speaker 2>so you can predict the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's correct to talk about people</v>

1718
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:48.230
<v Speaker 2>as agents who make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call that freewill.</v>

1719
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I call that freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most philosophers call it free will.</v>

1720
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to call it freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be my guest.</v>

1721
01:16:53.811 --> 01:16:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter to.</v>

1722
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I agree with what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that makes a lot of sense and I</v>

1723
01:16:58.411 --> 01:17:01.050
<v Speaker 3>think that really simplifies a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex issue.</v>

1724
01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I looked at it and I have had this</v>

1725
01:17:03.781 --> 01:17:06.200
<v Speaker 3>conversation with sam as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1726
01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I totally see his point and I think he</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes 100 percent sense.</v>

1727
01:17:10.071 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 3>It's as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no arguing with it.</v>

1728
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's very rational that</v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

1729
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that it's very much</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what we were talking about earlier,</v>

1730
01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 3>that it's not necessarily just a one or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a zero,</v>

1731
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's a combination of these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>freewill.</v>

1732
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:29.810
<v Speaker 3>There has to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is some mechanism that chooses to</v>

1733
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:33.350
<v Speaker 3>do one thing versus another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some computation,</v>

1734
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>there's calculation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's debate,</v>

1735
01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 3>there's discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing inside of you.</v>

1736
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that process is that's causing</v>

1737
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 3>you to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1738
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:48.560
<v Speaker 3>how many times have people stayed up all</v>
<v Speaker 3>night going over and over and over a</v>

1739
01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 3>certain idea of trying to find a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational conclusion.</v>

1740
01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1741
01:17:52.861 --> 01:17:54.120
<v Speaker 2>well what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1742
01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1743
01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:59.550
<v Speaker 2>this is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually becomes interesting to talk</v>

1744
01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:01.360
<v Speaker 2>about the vocabulary we use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1745
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Because it becomes very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to know where to attach the</v>

1746
01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I or you,</v>

1747
01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to say I made a decision.</v>

1748
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1749
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided to have this can have pure</v>

1750
01:18:15.811 --> 01:18:17.550
<v Speaker 2>caffeine that you put in front of me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink it.</v>

1751
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have decided otherwise.</v>

1752
01:18:20.671 --> 01:18:23.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like does it make sense to say I could</v>

1753
01:18:23.761 --> 01:18:28.761
<v Speaker 2>have decided otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you define yourself as the</v>

1754
01:18:28.891 --> 01:18:31.830
<v Speaker 2>following list of atoms and particles in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain configuration,</v>

1755
01:18:31.831 --> 01:18:34.650
<v Speaker 2>then no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the laws of physics said that that</v>

1756
01:18:34.651 --> 01:18:37.440
<v Speaker 2>was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what all that is.</v>

1757
01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:38.940
<v Speaker 2>That's not a useful way of talking.</v>

1758
01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:43.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's a whole nother way of talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that says I'm a person and I kind of</v>

1759
01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:45.600
<v Speaker 2>like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I already had a cup this morning and</v>

1760
01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance,</v>

1761
01:18:46.651 --> 01:18:49.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a probability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you say that I would drink this and</v>

1762
01:18:49.381 --> 01:18:53.130
<v Speaker 2>it probably that I would not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are completely compatible.</v>

1763
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Although they're different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way you get into trouble is if</v>

1764
01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:58.620
<v Speaker 2>you mix up those two different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

1765
01:18:58.621 --> 01:19:02.670
<v Speaker 2>If you say like I chose to have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee because my atoms were following</v>

1766
01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.170
<v Speaker 2>configuration or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1767
01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:07.200
<v Speaker 2>That's like talking about us as humans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then switching vocabulary.</v>

1768
01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.690
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about us as adams and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you get in trouble.</v>

1769
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird reductionist take on what</v>

1770
01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 3>it means to be a person that thinks.</v>

1771
01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:15.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:19:15.071 --> 01:19:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I think if you say there's no free will</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your adams,</v>

1773
01:19:18.281 --> 01:19:20.020
<v Speaker 2>then I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on board,</v>

1774
01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but no one in the world goes through</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that way for good reason and they</v>

1775
01:19:24.101 --> 01:19:25.210
<v Speaker 2>never will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>

1776
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he and you could break that all the</v>

1777
01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:30.070
<v Speaker 3>way down to creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1778
01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone sits down and writes</v>

1779
01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:34.900
<v Speaker 3>something like where's all that coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from?</v>

1780
01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think again,</v>

1781
01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:39.810
<v Speaker 2>there's feminism as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is an interesting question about,</v>

1782
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much we will ultimately be able to</v>

1783
01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.480
<v Speaker 2>unpack and understand about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1784
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Right now the brain is kind of just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery box to us and there's so much we</v>

1785
01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:51.270
<v Speaker 2>don't know about how people make</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>

1786
01:19:51.271 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 2>how they remember things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they come up with new ideas,</v>

1787
01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where it matters is how we treat</v>

1788
01:19:58.351 --> 01:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1789
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Like the obvious case is responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blame.</v>

1790
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think that a person makes</v>

1791
01:20:06.361 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can assign responsibility to</v>

1792
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:10.940
<v Speaker 2>them for making the choices they made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1793
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:13.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone chooses to rob a bank,</v>

1794
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:15.660
<v Speaker 2>we choose to put them in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1795
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 2>And someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could come along and say,</v>

1796
01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 2>no one ever does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone could come along and say,</v>

1797
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just a bunch of atoms obeying</v>

1798
01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 2>laws of physics.</v>

1799
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 2>How can you blame them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1800
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 2>It will pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense,</v>

1801
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>but what if you were minority report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1802
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:35.130
<v Speaker 2>What if you could like put someone in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>mri in a brain scanner and say,</v>

1803
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:35.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1804
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow they're gonna rob a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you arrest them?</v>

1805
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that enough?</v>

1806
01:20:41.291 --> 01:20:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that their brain was hooked up</v>

1807
01:20:44.161 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>to a to violate the law and the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that enough to sign personal</v>

1808
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 2>responsibility to them for that or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you more do you do the opposite and say,</v>

1809
01:20:51.271 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to happen no matter what.</v>

1810
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:53.460
<v Speaker 2>We can't really blame them.</v>

1811
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also if you do catch this thought</v>

1812
01:20:56.701 --> 01:21:00.090
<v Speaker 3>process is before the actual action</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes place,</v>

1813
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 3>isn't impossible to correct that thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>process with education or some sort of</v>

1814
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 3>awareness training or something where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could shift the consciousness and</v>

1815
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:14.930
<v Speaker 3>abruptly sort of disassembled</v>
<v Speaker 3>determinism at its most problematic</v>

1816
01:21:16.891 --> 01:21:17.570
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1817
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a.</v>

1818
01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:23.561
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole kind of a interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>set of ideas that are very popular among</v>

1819
01:21:24.411 --> 01:21:27.650
<v Speaker 2>philosophers right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the question of moral luck.</v>

1820
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're driving down the street and</v>

1821
01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 2>you're buzzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk,</v>

1822
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:35.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you get home,</v>

1823
01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:38.060
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone jumped in front of your</v>

1824
01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>car and you run them over because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the agility or the reflexes</v>

1825
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.130
<v Speaker 2>because you're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1826
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So you're the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went home,</v>

1827
01:21:46.941 --> 01:21:50.210
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk and you're driving home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but depending on the outside world,</v>

1828
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.770
<v Speaker 2>you ran someone over and killed them</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you didn't,</v>

1829
01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:56.450
<v Speaker 2>but in the world we blame the person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran somebody over.</v>

1830
01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:58.400
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we punish them much more severely than</v>

1831
01:21:58.401 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 2>the person who got home safely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1832
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.160
<v Speaker 2>That's not their responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of got unlucky there in the</v>

1833
01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:07.030
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So should we blame people who had the</v>

1834
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.370
<v Speaker 2>chance of doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows the answer to these</v>

1835
01:22:10.371 --> 01:22:11.000
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

1836
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.160
<v Speaker 2>these are tricky things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're not very good.</v>

1837
01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:16.700
<v Speaker 2>We human beings at the thing about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>probabilistic counterfactual questions.</v>

1838
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>

1839
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.100
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:24.210
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are you then?</v>

1842
01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lucky.</v>

1843
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1844
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much of what happens to us in life we</v>

1845
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 3>don't get responsibility for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for interfacing with random next every</v>

1846
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.050
<v Speaker 3>time we step out the door.</v>

1847
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1848
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you treat people that way</v>

1849
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:39.420
<v Speaker 2>consistently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>

1850
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky.</v>

1851
01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not giving the answer because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

1852
01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1853
01:22:43.011 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>this is tricky stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're certainly not like if you lived in</v>

1854
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:51.171
<v Speaker 2>a world where you thought that what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the world was preordained</v>

1855
01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 2>that there was all the great playing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a master plan or at the very least,</v>

1856
01:22:55.950 --> 01:23:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that there was some sort of a karmic</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence that made good things happen</v>

1857
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 2>to good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad things happen to bad people.</v>

1858
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Then the world makeS more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1859
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe</v>

1860
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.660
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least then the world seems if,</v>

1861
01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>if there's something random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can attach a reason why it happens.</v>

1862
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:17.530
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be something to karma in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you do good things,</v>

1863
01:23:17.531 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you make people feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel about you better,</v>

1864
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and then they interface with you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more positive way and that sort of like</v>

1865
01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>has this outgoing effect that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>karma.</v>

1866
01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 1>That's just a smart thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're right,</v>

1868
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is just sort of a western</v>

1869
01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>post enlightenment way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to sort of think about immediate</v>

1870
01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:42.640
<v Speaker 1>consequences for our actions for better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for worse,</v>

1871
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:47.020
<v Speaker 1>and in the real world sort of generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be good can often pay back in</v>

1872
01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:50.830
<v Speaker 1>good ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the woo woo thing is that we're</v>

1873
01:23:50.831 --> 01:23:55.831
<v Speaker 1>putting out this good energy and good</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy is coming back to us and it's a</v>

1874
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 1>fun way to look at things.</v>

1875
01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Although there's no evidence that points</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

1876
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1877
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm in a yoga class and my yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructor is talking about different</v>

1878
01:24:04.601 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 1>energy flowing through different chakras</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

1879
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't bother me as long as it</v>

1880
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:10.590
<v Speaker 1>makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1881
01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 1>do that exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a players a little bit,</v>

1882
01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:16.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to speak up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

1883
01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're not going to stop the</v>

1884
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.960
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling bullshit.</v>

1885
01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I would rather have that than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people want to come up with an excuse</v>

1886
01:24:24.281 --> 01:24:25.460
<v Speaker 1>to be a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1887
01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.390
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that yoga class is always the</v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

1888
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.040
<v Speaker 1>That's always where people go to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like we're,</v>

1889
01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:32.860
<v Speaker 1>we're woo comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1891
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've had,</v>

1892
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you've done yoga,</v>

1893
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a whole spectrum,</v>

1894
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:38.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1895
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Like there's teAchers who are basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>just physical therapists and there are</v>

1896
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:45.360
<v Speaker 1>people who are complete crazy hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1897
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to think the right thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1898
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people are always searching for some</v>

1899
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.780
<v Speaker 1>understanding of really complex issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>and behavior is very complex issue.</v>

1900
01:24:59.230 --> 01:25:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behavior and how you feel like whether</v>

1901
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1902
01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you feel spiritually enriched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you feel positive about</v>

1903
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:09.931
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1904
01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:13.570
<v Speaker 1>all these things are like which what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to manipulate these states,</v>

1905
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.590
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through meditation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness training,</v>

1906
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:21.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out a way to positively</v>
<v Speaker 1>interface,</v>

1907
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

1908
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And it goes back to where we started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about youtube comments because</v>

1909
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do react badly to bed too stupid.</v>

1910
01:25:29.531 --> 01:25:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a human being.</v>

1911
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:31.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a human being,</v>

1912
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the internet does a</v>

1913
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:38.770
<v Speaker 1>magnifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of our bad tendencies,</v>

1914
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

1915
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among these and until I totally include</v>

1916
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:48.100
<v Speaker 1>myself as a bad actor here in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just so easy to be sarcastic</v>

1917
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.630
<v Speaker 1>and put people down and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1918
01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dIsagree in sort of dismissive ways.</v>

1919
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to live in a world where</v>

1920
01:25:56.711 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including myself,</v>

1921
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>even when we disagree with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we disagree with people who</v>

1922
01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>are stupid and we're not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage them or improve</v>

1923
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 2>their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1924
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on with our own lives rather than</v>

1925
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to have a snarky comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I get that there's a purpose to</v>

1926
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>snark and sarcasm and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it weighs you down.</v>

1927
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why people complain about</v>

1928
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 2>twitter and social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's so much psychic energy just</v>

1929
01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>gets sapped by reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All oF these complaints on either side</v>

1930
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 2>has no political bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1931
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever your feelings are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else is making you feel down on</v>

1932
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the internet somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it does weigh on you.</v>

1933
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:32.640
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>

1934
01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.410
<v Speaker 3>there's weird impulse that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>with whether it's social,</v>

1935
01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.620
<v Speaker 3>whether it's twitter or youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

1936
01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 3>This is reductionist take on things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduce a person down to maybe one</v>

1937
01:26:48.841 --> 01:26:53.790
<v Speaker 3>statement or misinterpretations of one</v>
<v Speaker 3>position and then have that person be</v>

1938
01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:54.624
<v Speaker 3>dismissed.</v>

1939
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1940
01:26:55.901 --> 01:26:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1941
01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and it's a tough play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1942
01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:03.320
<v Speaker 2>after thinking about it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it was a bad decision that</v>

1943
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:04.880
<v Speaker 2>james gunn got fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1944
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've followed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little thing.</v>

1945
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Guardians of the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy guy.</v>

1946
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Well those were really bad tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1947
01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:12.790
<v Speaker 2>They just</v>

1948
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 3>weren't funny and he wrote a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they were a</v>

1949
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.490
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

1950
01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 2>a lot of about pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I totally get it right.</v>

1951
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shocked that he got in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

1952
01:27:22.881 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that his response was</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate,</v>

1953
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:28.120
<v Speaker 2>incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and grownup.</v>

1954
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.810
<v Speaker 2>He said he didn't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1955
01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a different time.</v>

1956
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:31.461
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1957
01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was shitty and it was wrong.</v>

1958
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 2>And I take responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think we got to let people</v>

1959
01:27:35.901 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 2>grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1960
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what most people in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of post mi do era have not done</v>

1961
01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 2>when they've been accused of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1962
01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 2>They haven't taken responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've made made excuses.</v>

1963
01:27:46.221 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>

1964
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:51.080
<v Speaker 2>especially twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's my favorite social media,</v>

1965
01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:51.933
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1966
01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 2>it is too easy to be reductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to be simplistic and to</v>

1967
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:57.020
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're one of,</v>

1968
01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that annoys me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most about twitter is when someone tries</v>

1969
01:28:01.911 --> 01:28:04.040
<v Speaker 2>to be good and then 20 other people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1970
01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:05.810
<v Speaker 2>you're not being good in precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right way.</v>

1971
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:08.703
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1972
01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 2>even though I failed to live up to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

1973
01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be charitable when I deal with</v>

1974
01:28:13.671 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in trouble on twitter the other</v>

1975
01:28:15.771 --> 01:28:19.250
<v Speaker 2>day for defending kellyanne conway a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

1976
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>What did she do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago?</v>

1977
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:25.340
<v Speaker 2>She did the alternative facts thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when she said when they were</v>

1978
01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:29.500
<v Speaker 2>talking about the inauguration crowd and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people pointing out like,</v>

1979
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:30.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just factually incorrect.</v>

1980
01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:31.461
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1981
01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 2>there are alternative facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1982
01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to defend kellyanne conway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a defender of her in general.</v>

1983
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that she just misspoke that</v>

1984
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 2>one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what she was trying to say</v>

1985
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 2>was there are additional facts that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could also look at.</v>

1986
01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's in a bigger context</v>

1987
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:51.590
<v Speaker 2>where she lies all the time and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1988
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:53.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's other people,</v>

1989
01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>she is an apologist for other liars.</v>

1990
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1991
01:28:56.630 --> 01:29:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea that these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I disagree with politically are so</v>

1992
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:06.090
<v Speaker 2>divorced from reality that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can just make up their own reality.</v>

1993
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>No one actually thinks that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people who,</v>

1994
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who disagree with me about</v>

1995
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:15.921
<v Speaker 2>politics or religion or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comforting for me to think that</v>

1996
01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>just cheerfully making up facts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality by them selves.</v>

1998
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:25.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't think of themselves that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that they're being truthful.</v>

1999
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:27.220
<v Speaker 2>They think of they're being rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

2000
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I should at least grant them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they think in their own</v>

2001
01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:31.090
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2002
01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:33.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to disagree with you on that</v>

2003
01:29:33.190 --> 01:29:35.020
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2004
01:29:35.021 --> 01:29:39.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that she's granted any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of autonomous decision making</v>

2005
01:29:39.641 --> 01:29:42.850
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is probably something</v>

2006
01:29:42.851 --> 01:29:47.851
<v Speaker 3>that was sat down that they sat down</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a team of experts or you know,</v>

2007
01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:51.400
<v Speaker 3>air quote experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>team of people that were in that,</v>

2008
01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.640
<v Speaker 3>in that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

2009
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 3>whether it's press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are spin doctors where they're</v>

2010
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:01.240
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out a best way to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of this.</v>

2011
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.440
<v Speaker 3>And one of the best ways was this</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of alternative facts.</v>

2012
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Very similar to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways where trump was in that</v>

2013
01:30:09.731 --> 01:30:14.731
<v Speaker 3>meeting with putin at very famous awful</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting that happened recently where he</v>

2014
01:30:14.891 --> 01:30:18.070
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any reason why it would be</v>

2015
01:30:18.071 --> 01:30:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Russia that's interfering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said afterwards,</v>

2016
01:30:21.281 --> 01:30:25.510
<v Speaker 3>obviously I misspoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was clear what I meant to</v>

2017
01:30:25.511 --> 01:30:25.960
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

2018
01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see any reason why wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say.</v>

2019
01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:32.140
<v Speaker 3>But it's clear if you watch him say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:30:32.141 --> 01:30:34.270
<v Speaker 3>That's not what he sells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Entirely bullshit,</v>

2021
01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.940
<v Speaker 3>entirely bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous bullshit,</v>

2022
01:30:36.941 --> 01:30:39.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think gary bullshit in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2023
01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:42.010
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a lie.</v>

2024
01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

2025
01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.500
<v Speaker 3>in context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he's expressing himself and it's</v>

2026
01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:50.140
<v Speaker 3>clearly he's dismissing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would it be,</v>

2027
01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:52.840
<v Speaker 3>why would it be Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not saying why wouldn't it be</v>

2028
01:30:52.841 --> 01:30:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Russia because he's standing right next</v>
<v Speaker 3>to putin and he would be saying that in</v>

2029
01:30:57.341 --> 01:31:02.341
<v Speaker 3>a much more measured and you would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be accusing.</v>

2030
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was clearly a case where he did</v>

2031
01:31:06.511 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 2>something really bad and he came home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of his advisors said that we</v>

2032
01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:13.920
<v Speaker 2>have to fix this little bit and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with a really clumsy,</v>

2033
01:31:13.921 --> 01:31:14.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly.</v>

2034
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 2>That's all they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they had.</v>

2035
01:31:16.501 --> 01:31:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's so blatant,</v>

2036
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:20.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternative facts is also all that.</v>

2037
01:31:20.530 --> 01:31:21.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2038
01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be right.</v>

2039
01:31:22.111 --> 01:31:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2040
01:31:23.161 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really study it very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it was just a spontaneous</v>

2041
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:30.570
<v Speaker 2>blurting out a be my favorite too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because here's why.</v>

2042
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's probably right</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think I was trying to</v>

2043
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:35.050
<v Speaker 2>say before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's their</v>

2044
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 2>self-conception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people often think that the people</v>

2045
01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:42.420
<v Speaker 2>that they disagree with a think false</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2046
01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:45.570
<v Speaker 2>that's very natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also also like uncharitable he</v>

2047
01:31:45.571 --> 01:31:50.000
<v Speaker 2>say they know their thinking false</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and they're,</v>

2048
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2049
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>they're happily making up their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of reality.</v>

2050
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that happens,</v>

2051
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.200
<v Speaker 2>like if you're just a con man or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2052
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 2>but I think that more often than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to admit people are sincere in</v>

2053
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 2>their very false beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2054
01:32:04.230 --> 01:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just find it implausible that,</v>

2055
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean kellyanne conway again lies all</v>

2056
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not my defense for my defense of</v>

2057
01:32:13.031 --> 01:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>hers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just that she would not go out</v>

2058
01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:17.110
<v Speaker 2>there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yes,</v>

2059
01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>but we're making up new facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not the kind of thing.</v>

2060
01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2061
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:21.610
<v Speaker 2>She didn't say it that way</v>

2062
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.650
<v Speaker 3>where she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are all turned art.</v>

2063
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:28.980
<v Speaker 3>There are alternative facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you got to think that he's playing</v>

2064
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:34.770
<v Speaker 3>to the dumbest people in the room all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time and fortunately for him that's</v>

2065
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:36.390
<v Speaker 3>a big number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2066
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:41.610
<v Speaker 3>and there's a recent thing where he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>defending his behavior saying that</v>

2067
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:46.681
<v Speaker 3>anyone can act presidential and he stood</v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage and he did this sort of like</v>

2068
01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:51.310
<v Speaker 3>robotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boring walk back and forth,</v>

2069
01:32:51.311 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 3>and then he started talking in a boring</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and mocking it.</v>

2070
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting about the video</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not just him doing this,</v>

2071
01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 3>which is very silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the people behind him</v>

2072
01:33:02.531 --> 01:33:05.440
<v Speaker 3>thinking it's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2075
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 3>anyone can act presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very,</v>

2076
01:33:15.071 --> 01:33:18.490
<v Speaker 3>very recently and a lot of people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this going what?</v>

2077
01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But he alSo thinks you need id to buy</v>

<v Speaker 2>like very vocally anti-trump.</v>

2087
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:47.100

<v Speaker 2>He's constantly subtweeting and like,</v>

01:33:47.101 --> 01:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of trump.</v>

2091
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Fun household,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's.</v>

2092
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 3>This is what gets me go full screen in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gulf.</v>

2093
01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is these dummies</v>

2094
01:33:59.931 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 3>behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Like while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the interesting things about this</v>

2096
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:10.460
<v Speaker 3>to me is that his back is to all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2097
01:34:10.461 --> 01:34:12.410
<v Speaker 3>which is a very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2098
01:34:12.411 --> 01:34:13.450
<v Speaker 3>So they're all</v>

2099
01:34:13.770 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 2>behind him instead of having a static</v>
<v Speaker 2>backdrop.</v>

2100
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting to a part of the thing is</v>

2101
01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:22.920
<v Speaker 2>the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just him,</v>

2102
01:34:22.921 --> 01:34:26.460
<v Speaker 2>it's their reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:29.040
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sense of belonging to a weird</v>

2104
01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:30.480
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:34:30.481 --> 01:34:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And everyone has that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like leftist and rightness and whatever.</v>

2106
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.310
<v Speaker 2>All have this weird belonging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it's.</v>

2107
01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the China thing,</v>

2108
01:34:38.011 --> 01:34:38.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2109
01:34:38.311 --> 01:34:40.410
<v Speaker 2>we have fox news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a way of giving people</v>

2110
01:34:40.411 --> 01:34:44.100
<v Speaker 2>information that if you follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow fox news on twitter because I</v>

2111
01:34:44.101 --> 01:34:49.101
<v Speaker 2>want to see what they're telling people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing because it's not like</v>

2112
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.910
<v Speaker 2>it's all lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2113
01:34:50.911 --> 01:34:52.590
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's often lies,</v>

2114
01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:56.160
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a very different mixture</v>

2115
01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>of things than you would get from</v>

2116
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the media and a lot of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2117
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you follow fox news,</v>

2118
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're targeting an older white,</v>

2119
01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 1>a rural suburban audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2120
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:12.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of like weird human</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest stories about an alligator</v>

2121
01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:13.640
<v Speaker 1>popping out of the sewer and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2122
01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>like things that are not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no political agenda,</v>

2123
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but they're just trying to get those old</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people to pay attention.</v>

2124
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're sending a message that the</v>

2125
01:35:21.621 --> 01:35:24.180
<v Speaker 1>world is kinda scary and weird and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2126
01:35:24.190 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>we need to protect ourselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>later on the golf course,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2129
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>The alligator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golf courses is my favorite.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cheerleading for this bizarrely</v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional administration.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think it's number one and it's fucking</v>

2136
01:35:51.951 --> 01:35:53.210
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2137
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.850
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was just a poll.</v>

2138
01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:58.040
<v Speaker 1>This goes back to the social credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2139
01:35:58.041 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They did a poll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the most trusted news source?</v>

2140
01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fox news gave me number two.</v>

2141
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:05.570
<v Speaker 1>What's number one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bbc.</v>

2142
01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:08.150

<v Speaker 1>We'll cnn.</v>

2143
01:36:08.151 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just taken a giant hit because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his constant,</v>

2144
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:15.170
<v Speaker 1>constant berating of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see jim acosta,</v>

2145
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

2146
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these pro wrestling fans like giving</v>

2147
01:36:18.771 --> 01:36:23.771
<v Speaker 1>them the finger and screaming at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's what I do worry that this is a</v>

2148
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:28.010
<v Speaker 1>hard thing to come back from because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2149
01:36:28.011 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 1>once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another thing that trump said was</v>

2150
01:36:32.061 --> 01:36:32.391
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2152
01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Unless you hear it from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says the same thing now.</v>

2153
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tucker carlson said the same thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He say that to tucker carlson said like</v>

2155
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:43.370
<v Speaker 1>any other shows in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe it.</v>

2156
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2157
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the media he has on women for</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

2158
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after listening to this radio</v>

2159
01:36:54.471 --> 01:36:58.670
<v Speaker 1>lab podcast about these russian troll</v>
<v Speaker 1>farms and about how they implement these</v>

2160
01:36:58.671 --> 01:36:59.510
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to think,</v>

2161
01:37:00.570 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 1>is all of this organic is how many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of this is orchestrated?</v>

2162
01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>How much of this attacking cnn is</v>
<v Speaker 1>orchestrated?</v>

2163
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it is part of it is just it</v>
<v Speaker 1>builds on itself.</v>

2164
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.700
<v Speaker 1>All you need is just a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>push.</v>

2165
01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Just talking to someone who is a who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>boasting about how hard to Donald Trump</v>

2166
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:22.380
<v Speaker 1>works that like compared to previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

2167
01:37:22.381 --> 01:37:27.381
<v Speaker 1>he's really just putting in the hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could think of that he wakes</v>

2168
01:37:29.571 --> 01:37:32.950
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady watches eight hours of tv every</v>

2169
01:37:32.951 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2170
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.980
<v Speaker 1>He spends all the time at his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>resorts,</v>

2171
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:37.430
<v Speaker 1>like of all the fantasies you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent.</v>

2172
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a very weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2173
01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 1>people just love to find narratives of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>

2174
01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:45.070
<v Speaker 1>What would be acceptable for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

2175
01:37:45.071 --> 01:37:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So this side that they've taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

2176
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:48.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he give him credit,</v>

2178
01:37:50.211 --> 01:37:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he gives people a narrative that works</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

2179
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cnn does it too because cnn,</v>

2180
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:56.430
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spent so little time,</v>

2181
01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going over donner,</v>

2182
01:37:58.201 --> 01:38:03.201
<v Speaker 1>brazil's book about how the dnc had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted and about how they had rigged</v>

2183
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>the primaries for hillary and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed bernie sanders over.</v>

2184
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 1>This is not a narrative that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwelled on.</v>

2185
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>They didn't dwell on the fact that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally deleted 30 plus thousand</v>

2186
01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:17.790
<v Speaker 1>emails and said they were about yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

2187
01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Like that shit is just as preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as.</v>

2188
01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just as damning against cnn as some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nonsense that fox news does.</v>

2189
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:31.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no one pure organization of news</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's holy object.</v>

2190
01:38:31.551 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not just as I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that fox news is a special,</v>

2191
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.070
<v Speaker 1>especially damning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it talks,</v>

2192
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean fox news was founded by a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a political operative for the</v>

2193
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:41.820
<v Speaker 1>republican party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2194
01:38:41.821 --> 01:38:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Like there might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like individual reporters for most news</v>

2195
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 1>organizations tend to be liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also sometimes tend to</v>

2196
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:51.840
<v Speaker 1>overcorrect for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to try to bend over backwards to be</v>

2197
01:38:51.841 --> 01:38:54.120
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way more republicans are quoted in</v>

2198
01:38:54.121 --> 01:38:58.470
<v Speaker 1>New York times and democrats ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there are certainly</v>

2199
01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:03.350
<v Speaker 1>biases and certainly I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresentation of reality from all of</v>

2200
01:39:03.351 --> 01:39:06.450
<v Speaker 1>these different outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think fox news is special among</v>

2201
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the major ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2202
01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I would concede that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that one example of the</v>

2203
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 1>New York times is different because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York times,</v>

2204
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I feel like because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually writers and it's in text,</v>

2205
01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you're not dealing with people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be comfortable performing in front of</v>

2206
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:26.820
<v Speaker 1>a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which eliminates a large swath of</v>

2207
01:39:26.821 --> 01:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals.</v>

2208
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different medium.</v>

2209
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:34.311
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely they fact check and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnival corrections in a way that the.</v>

2210
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:36.620
<v Speaker 1>The tv does not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2211
01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:38.890
<v Speaker 1>it's theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

2212
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And the people like sean hannity that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read his written word,</v>

2213
01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2214
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:47.543
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2215
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:50.250
<v Speaker 1>like I said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry about what happens next because</v>

2216
01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that trump will win again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you will.</v>

2217
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's entirely possible</v>

2218
01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.000
<v Speaker 1>he'll win again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:39:57.001 --> 01:39:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2220
01:39:58.171 --> 01:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was going to win the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first one she was going to say,</v>

2221
01:40:00.571 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like before Donald Trump,</v>

2222
01:40:02.851 --> 01:40:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I was really good at predicting who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win elections and I have no</v>

2223
01:40:06.841 --> 01:40:08.820
<v Speaker 1>ability once he's in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2224
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:11.820
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry that the people who sort of are</v>

2225
01:40:11.821 --> 01:40:15.080
<v Speaker 1>on his side are going to feel even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised,</v>

2226
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:18.900
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted and angry after he loses</v>
<v Speaker 1>again than they do now.</v>

2227
01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna be a problem.</v>

2228
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the reasons why</v>

2229
01:40:24.181 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I said it's entirely possible and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if he will win again,</v>

2230
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even know if I believe he'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>

2231
01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the reasons why</v>

2232
01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that is I don't see who's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big candidate on the other side.</v>

2233
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It's opposing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stands out right now.</v>

2234
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:39.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

2235
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real issue with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wanting the job.</v>

2236
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a really scary job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it,</v>

2237
01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it sucks you dry like a vampire that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked up to the back of your neck is</v>

2238
01:40:54.211 --> 01:40:59.211
<v Speaker 1>just so even with him with his unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to sociopathically sort of</v>

2239
01:41:00.461 --> 01:41:03.790
<v Speaker 1>navigate the waters of accusations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>

2240
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 1>he still looks beaten down by this job.</v>

2241
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people want it.</v>

2242
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not the people we want to want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2243
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Who sit on the democrat side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants it on the left?</v>

2244
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.440
<v Speaker 1>That stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2245
01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm not excited by any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people right now,</v>

2246
01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but the whole one is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's going to be 10 people</v>

2247
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:22.970
<v Speaker 1>running at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2248
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the biden is at least a 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent chance to run.</v>

2249
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth warren's definitely going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run a with warren though.</v>

2250
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.500
<v Speaker 1>She's got that real problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole pocahontas thing.</v>

2251
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Well the whole indian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that narrative and then what are you</v>

2252
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:37.250
<v Speaker 1>going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2253
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a giant problem.</v>

2254
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:43.780
<v Speaker 1>The thing that she may have faked</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not she has native american</v>

2255
01:41:43.781 --> 01:41:48.550
<v Speaker 1>heritage and she's not willing to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dna test and there's this native</v>

2256
01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:52.340
<v Speaker 1>american heritage she claimed is how she</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into harvard and she.</v>

2257
01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 1>She used that in order to get special</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and that's a problem.</v>

2258
01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you should forgive</v>

2259
01:41:58.421 --> 01:42:00.430
<v Speaker 1>someone for something they did a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago,</v>

2260
01:42:00.431 --> 01:42:05.431
<v Speaker 1>which I think you probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it's sort of in some ways</v>

2261
01:42:06.311 --> 01:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>negates a lot of the good work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that she said because people say,</v>

2262
01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lied about her actual ethnicity.</v>

2263
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2264
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:18.670
<v Speaker 1>But what is hard for me to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict how much it will matter.</v>

2265
01:42:18.671 --> 01:42:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in 2008,</v>

2266
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:25.510
<v Speaker 1>we had a race between Vietnam war hero</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a black guy.</v>

2267
01:42:25.511 --> 01:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>He was middle name was hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2268
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:29.680
<v Speaker 1>If you had told me that a few years</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

2269
01:42:29.681 --> 01:42:31.690
<v Speaker 1>who's going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have gotten that one.</v>

2270
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.860
<v Speaker 1>We also had sarah pailin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2271
01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we don't know had taken a</v>

2272
01:42:36.401 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 1>better running mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>

2273
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Mccain would've been president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people were really tired of</v>

2274
01:42:41.981 --> 01:42:45.160
<v Speaker 1>george w and I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mccain was just not a good candidate.</v>

2275
01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I think he was gonna lose no matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

2276
01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.280
<v Speaker 1>But I think also obama was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>charismatic and so uniquely intelligent</v>

2277
01:42:51.971 --> 01:42:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and smooth and relaxed and statesmen</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2278
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fit the bill and remember on a</v>

2279
01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about like he went to jeremiah</v>

2280
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:01.670
<v Speaker 1>rights church and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2281
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Stuff that didn't like at the time it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big deal and you know,</v>

2282
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.750
<v Speaker 1>who cares eight years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know about the pocahontas</v>

2283
01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:09.730
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

2284
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pocahontas stuff is a big one</v>

2285
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.460
<v Speaker 1>because it's a personal lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2286
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think cory booker is going to</v>

2287
01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:20.980
<v Speaker 1>run camela harris might run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2288
01:43:20.981 --> 01:43:22.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people.</v>

2289
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I would not be at all surprised that joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>biden didn't run and I kind of don't</v>

2290
01:43:26.231 --> 01:43:30.250
<v Speaker 1>think that he should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's getting up there and he's in</v>

2291
01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Washington insider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not really what the country</v>

2292
01:43:32.231 --> 01:43:32.590
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2293
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 1>In 1988 in boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have joe biden night at the</v>

2294
01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:41.140
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs and joe biden night was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>night where we would do other people's</v>

2295
01:43:41.141 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 1>material because this is when joe biden</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted.</v>

2296
01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with kennedy's speeches.</v>

2297
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2298
01:43:47.201 --> 01:43:52.201
<v Speaker 1>and neil connect the british politician</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was when he was running for</v>

2299
01:43:52.311 --> 01:43:53.940
<v Speaker 1>president in [inaudible] 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2300
01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And so we've never done very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>running for president.</v>

2301
01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.460
<v Speaker 1>He's won several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so I'm,</v>

2302
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that he was a good vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>president to people like him for that</v>

2303
01:44:02.631 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>and they might not want them to do more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the vice president is a great job.</v>

2304
01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 1>She want no one to pay attention to you.</v>

2305
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:08.640
<v Speaker 1>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2306
01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like being the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2307
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costar and a buddy cop movie with a</v>

2308
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:17.000
<v Speaker 1>huge super theory responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to some funerals.</v>

2309
01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

2310
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're mike pence where you're</v>

2311
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 1>trying to make it the handmaid's tale</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes.</v>

2312
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>He seems like he's kind of laying back</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2313
01:44:24.681 --> 01:44:28.040
<v Speaker 1>like especially over the last few months</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2314
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Trump is so insane that you see very</v>
<v Speaker 1>little mike.</v>

2315
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you see very little of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

2316
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think that he's trying his best to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in policies behind the scenes.</v>

2317
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2318
01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 1>what is this new thing that jeff</v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions is trying to push?</v>

2319
01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Religious freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2320
01:44:44.601 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 1>which means you have to obey whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentalist christians want to</v>

2321
01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:48.591
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>

2323
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>michael mouse was tweeting about this</v>

2324
01:44:52.221 --> 01:44:53.380
<v Speaker 1>the other day when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

2325
01:44:53.381 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tweeted this,</v>

2326
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I said that aversion of sharia law</v>

2327
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.980
<v Speaker 1>could very well be coming out of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

2328
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:02.360
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2329
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2330
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:08.561
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird backward thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>define religious freedom to be let</v>

2331
01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist christians do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

2332
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do it by law.</v>

2333
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:14.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:45:14.301 --> 01:45:15.134
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

2335
01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2336
01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:20.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2337
01:45:20.151 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean if someone wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A part of me is a little bit libertarian</v>

2338
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.940
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to personal action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if someone doesn't want to deal</v>

2339
01:45:25.941 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their right.</v>

2340
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:32.510
<v Speaker 2>But when whole groups are being subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>systematically to discrimination,</v>

2341
01:45:32.511 --> 01:45:35.390
<v Speaker 2>like gays are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the government steps in to protect</v>

2342
01:45:35.391 --> 01:45:36.740
<v Speaker 2>them a little bit and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2343
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2344
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.780
<v Speaker 2>doctors don't want to do abortions or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2345
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 2>health care providers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance providers don't want to pay</v>

2346
01:45:43.221 --> 01:45:45.830
<v Speaker 2>for things because of their religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs or,</v>

2347
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:48.980
<v Speaker 2>or catholic universities don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do certain things.</v>

2348
01:45:48.981 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2349
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:53.780
<v Speaker 2>these are legitimate questions and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really having a grown up</v>

2350
01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:57.260
<v Speaker 2>intellectual conversation about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just throwing feces at each other.</v>

2351
01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:58.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this particular arena.</v>

2352
01:45:59.130 --> 01:46:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also strange when someone comes up</v>

2353
01:46:01.111 --> 01:46:05.940
<v Speaker 1>with some sort of a new idea like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes against the separation of</v>

2354
01:46:05.941 --> 01:46:10.941
<v Speaker 1>church and state and it's being promoted</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a guy who's openly religious and says</v>

2355
01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:15.510
<v Speaker 1>about a bunch of really preposterous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2356
01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally someone who's not a very</v>

2357
01:46:19.021 --> 01:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy source of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intellectual discourse.</v>

2358
01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this,</v>

2359
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:29.050
<v Speaker 2>there's this vaccinating question about</v>
<v Speaker 2>why a white depth angelicals or trump's</v>

2360
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 2>biggest support group like huge track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he is not</v>

2361
01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:36.590
<v Speaker 2>religious himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's the biggest sinner ever to be</v>

2362
01:46:36.591 --> 01:46:38.410
<v Speaker 2>in the oval office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2363
01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.460
<v Speaker 2>but they love hIm and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

2364
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it comes well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

2365
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:49.100
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of the strategic questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it comes down to abortion,</v>

2366
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:51.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want supreme court justices will</v>

2367
01:46:51.091 --> 01:46:53.730
<v Speaker 2>overturn roe v dot wade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that then whoever,</v>

2368
01:46:53.731 --> 01:46:55.410
<v Speaker 2>however they're going to get that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for them.</v>

2369
01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a whole much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>elaborate apologetics about how god is</v>

2370
01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:05.190
<v Speaker 2>using Donald Trump as his instrument to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the country better.</v>

2371
01:47:05.191 --> 01:47:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Even if he himself is a flawed vessel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes god works through flAwed</v>

2372
01:47:09.301 --> 01:47:10.134
<v Speaker 2>vessels.</v>

2373
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you position yourself as an ally,</v>

2374
01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:16.920
<v Speaker 3>even if you have previously send.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The beautiful thing about christianity</v>

2375
01:47:16.921 --> 01:47:19.260
<v Speaker 3>is all you have to do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not me anymore.</v>

2376
01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:24.261
<v Speaker 3>I found jesus and I saw a pastor on</v>
<v Speaker 3>television going on about that and about</v>

2377
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 3>even when you're talking about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the trump before he</v>

2378
01:47:30.031 --> 01:47:33.930
<v Speaker 3>found jesus and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a past,</v>

2379
01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am born again.</v>

2380
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I do not have a past due you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was going on about this whole</v>

2381
01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 3>thing about this concept of trump is now</v>
<v Speaker 3>an agent of god,</v>

2382
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but I don't necessarily even think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>christianity.</v>

2383
01:47:46.761 --> 01:47:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that religion can be infinitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>malleable to the purposes of the moment.</v>

2384
01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.470
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't have said that about obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whoever.</v>

2385
01:47:54.471 --> 01:47:55.304
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2386
01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 2>you pick and choose when you apply your</v>
<v Speaker 2>criteria.</v>

2387
01:47:59.121 --> 01:48:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this once as an exercise for</v>

2388
01:48:01.251 --> 01:48:04.430
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain phrases in the bible or</v>

2389
01:48:04.431 --> 01:48:08.900
<v Speaker 2>certain passages in the bible which are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of unapologetically left wing and</v>

2390
01:48:08.901 --> 01:48:09.980
<v Speaker 2>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2391
01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Just like there are others that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>unapologetically right wing and</v>

2392
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:15.200
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big book full of different</v>

2393
01:48:15.201 --> 01:48:17.330
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wondered like how.</v>

2394
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:21.050
<v Speaker 2>What did they tell themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do the people who don't fall in</v>

2395
01:48:21.051 --> 01:48:23.480
<v Speaker 2>that side of the spectrum tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves about these passages in the</v>

2396
01:48:23.481 --> 01:48:24.580
<v Speaker 2>bible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's one famous,</v>

2397
01:48:24.581 --> 01:48:27.950
<v Speaker 2>very famous passage about how it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier for</v>

2398
01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.660
<v Speaker 2>a camel to pass through the eye of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>needle than for a rich man to enter the</v>

2399
01:48:32.661 --> 01:48:33.470
<v Speaker 2>kingdom of heaven.</v>

2400
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly,</v>

2401
01:48:34.881 --> 01:48:39.881
<v Speaker 2>I think that anyone who reads this says</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an anti rich person statement so</v>

2402
01:48:41.210 --> 01:48:43.340
<v Speaker 2>you can google it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so what do people say about this?</v>

2403
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:47.210
<v Speaker 2>So my favorite explanation was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2404
01:48:47.211 --> 01:48:50.540
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible for camels to pass</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the eyes of a needle,</v>

2405
01:48:50.610 --> 01:48:55.610
<v Speaker 2>except if jesus helps them or if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind the camel down to dust and they</v>

2406
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:02.090
<v Speaker 2>interpreted this as jesus said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that only through jesus we get into</v>

2407
01:49:02.091 --> 01:49:03.770
<v Speaker 2>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really the only lesson they get.</v>

2408
01:49:04.610 --> 01:49:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2409
01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's nothing to do with rick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is find jesus.</v>

2410
01:49:08.361 --> 01:49:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And if you're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>

2411
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my time.</v>

2412
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:13.610
<v Speaker 2>This is why I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I'm an atheist,</v>

2413
01:49:13.611 --> 01:49:14.444
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2414
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy to explain why I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that god exists,</v>

2415
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:22.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't blame religion most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time for people's bad actions because I</v>

2416
01:49:22.581 --> 01:49:26.510
<v Speaker 2>think that religion is just sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>catalyst lets people find excuses for</v>

2417
01:49:26.511 --> 01:49:29.750
<v Speaker 2>their bad actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's usually the bad actions,</v>

2418
01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.790
<v Speaker 2>the desire to do bad actions that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

2419
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever look at religion as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential almost evolutionary software</v>

2420
01:49:37.111 --> 01:49:42.111
<v Speaker 3>program that's allowed people to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopt morality and impose certain</v>

2421
01:49:43.951 --> 01:49:46.980
<v Speaker 3>standards of behavior that are conducive</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2422
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So people talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2423
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:52.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a little skeptical because it sounds</v>

2424
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:55.600
<v Speaker 2>like too much of a story to tell after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact.</v>

2425
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are a little bit quick</v>

2426
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.500
<v Speaker 2>to attribute ideas and cultural concepts</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evolution.</v>

2427
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly,</v>

2428
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion was not like just science done</v>

2429
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:09.850
<v Speaker 2>badly back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2430
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Like what religion was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was something much more expansive inter,</v>

2431
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:18.750
<v Speaker 2>inter leafed with your life overall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was not just how the world was</v>

2432
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:23.640
<v Speaker 2>created and whether god exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was how to be a good person,</v>

2433
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 2>how to live in your community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2434
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disentangling these things is one of the</v>

2435
01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 2>reasons why religion is still hanging</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

2436
01:50:31.601 --> 01:50:33.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even after the kind of</v>

2437
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:38.890
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of the religion in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of understanding how the world works had</v>

2438
01:50:38.891 --> 01:50:40.780
<v Speaker 2>been removed by science.</v>

2439
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:43.070
<v Speaker 2>The other functions are still there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2440
01:50:43.071 --> 01:50:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big critic of my fellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturalists who have not put enough</v>

2441
01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:50.890
<v Speaker 2>effort into replacing the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions of religion.</v>

2442
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Now that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2443
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:55.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the claims about the world are no longer</v>

2444
01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:58.200
<v Speaker 2>viable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to present it.</v>

2445
01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2446
01:51:01.290 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's really a problem when there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many versions.</v>

2447
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2448
01:51:06.011 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the many,</v>

2449
01:51:06.881 --> 01:51:11.650
<v Speaker 2>many reasons why I think that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really credible to be religious</v>

2450
01:51:11.651 --> 01:51:16.651
<v Speaker 2>intellectually is because if in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>classic traditional western religious</v>

2451
01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:20.140
<v Speaker 2>sense where there's a god and he cares</v>
<v Speaker 2>about us,</v>

2452
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:22.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's all sorts of questions about</v>

2453
01:51:22.121 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 2>where we define the boundary of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

2454
01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:25.810
<v Speaker 2>whether buddhism is a religion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2455
01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:29.560
<v Speaker 2>But in the usual sense that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we grew up with in this country,</v>

2456
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm surely if that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god would have done a much better job of</v>

2457
01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:37.060
<v Speaker 2>explaining himself to us.</v>

2458
01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would god give us his message</v>

2459
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:44.140
<v Speaker 2>through a bunch of people in a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>country who didn't write?</v>

2460
01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:46.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the new testament wasn't written</v>

2461
01:51:46.271 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 2>down until decades after the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the people who wrote it down</v>

2462
01:51:49.451 --> 01:51:52.030
<v Speaker 2>were eye witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it only shared there?</v>

2463
01:51:52.031 --> 01:51:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

2464
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.240
<v Speaker 2>it's god is god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2465
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Like he could easily have showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the world talk to them and</v>

2466
01:51:57.161 --> 01:51:59.680
<v Speaker 2>explain how things were going and let</v>
<v Speaker 2>them make their own choices.</v>

2467
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:02.980
<v Speaker 2>That would have been a much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient way of getting the message</v>

2468
01:52:02.981 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just not really sensible to</v>

2469
01:52:06.071 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 2>think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if god didn't exist,</v>

2470
01:52:08.710 --> 01:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>then what you would imagine is that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries,</v>

2471
01:52:11.201 --> 01:52:13.840
<v Speaker 2>in different parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different periods in history,</v>

2472
01:52:13.841 --> 01:52:16.680
<v Speaker 2>people would tell their own stories and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all be a little bit different and</v>

2473
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:18.550
<v Speaker 2>they'd be adaptive there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>local circumstances,</v>

2474
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and they'd be utterly incompatible with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2475
01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what you find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you speculate as to what the origins</v>

2476
01:52:25.541 --> 01:52:30.100
<v Speaker 2>of the concept of god are since so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different groups of people all over the</v>

2477
01:52:30.101 --> 01:52:35.101
<v Speaker 2>world have a very similar idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least that there's some omnipotent</v>

2478
01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:39.220
<v Speaker 2>superpower that's controlling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny of everything?</v>

2479
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So number one,</v>

2480
01:52:40.931 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea of omnipotence was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually somewhat late coming onto the</v>

2481
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:45.411
<v Speaker 2>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2482
01:52:45.411 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Like if you dig into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2483
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:50.540
<v Speaker 2>what was happening before 2000 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

2484
01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2485
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 2>the hebrew god was not omnipotent at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>

2486
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:55.483
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2487
01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:59.150
<v Speaker 2>the hebrews came out of a polytheistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>society where there were lots of</v>

2488
01:52:59.151 --> 01:53:04.151
<v Speaker 2>different gods around and you can trace</v>
<v Speaker 2>how their god evolved over time and</v>

2489
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:04.911
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2490
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>became their god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2491
01:53:06.861 --> 01:53:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Like there was one god that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the hebrews were,</v>

2492
01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:10.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2493
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:14.630
<v Speaker 2>a worshiping and the egyptians and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>babylonians and worship other gods.</v>

2494
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Then they started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2495
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:17.690
<v Speaker 2>our god is better than all the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

2496
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:18.830
<v Speaker 2>And then they started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2497
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:20.240
<v Speaker 2>the other ones don't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2498
01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:23.840
<v Speaker 2>And it was an evolution over time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>omnipotence came late,</v>

2499
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 2>like you would talk about the gods</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarreling if you were a polytheistic</v>

2500
01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 2>pagan culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually makes more like a lot of</v>

2501
01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 2>the world makes more sense if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe there's a whole bunch of gods</v>

2502
01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 2>out there who disagree with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2503
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly lots of aspects of realities</v>
<v Speaker 2>come into focus.</v>

2504
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>But the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's supernatural,</v>

2505
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:44.960
<v Speaker 2>very powerful influences in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2506
01:53:44.961 --> 01:53:48.650
<v Speaker 2>that's just an obvious idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like we're human beings,</v>

2507
01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:51.080
<v Speaker 2>we tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as our first guest and understanding the</v>

2508
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:53.620
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat the world as,</v>

2509
01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanists,</v>

2510
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2511
01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:57.990
<v Speaker 2>we're anthropomorphic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2512
01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something exists,</v>

2513
01:53:59.601 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it must have been designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be a reason,</v>

2514
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 2>there must be a purpose.</v>

2515
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things work in a certain way because</v>

2516
01:54:04.911 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 2>someone made them that way and that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see that person hanging around,</v>

2517
01:54:08.901 --> 01:54:09.950
<v Speaker 2>so it must be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2518
01:54:09.951 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 2>up there in the sky or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that hard to imagine</v>

2519
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that all sorts of different cultures</v>
<v Speaker 2>would evolve.</v>

2520
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's also a function of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up with mentors and father</v>

2521
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:23.870
<v Speaker 2>figures and leaders and chieftains and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always someone who is the big,</v>

2522
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:27.800
<v Speaker 2>the big kahuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the sky daddy.</v>

2523
01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sky daddy overlooks the big picture.</v>

2524
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I think there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the idea of your ancestors and</v>

2525
01:54:33.621 --> 01:54:35.630
<v Speaker 2>ancestor worship or veneration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2526
01:54:35.631 --> 01:54:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Which is also very almost universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2527
01:54:38.931 --> 01:54:40.160
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in primitive cultures,</v>

2528
01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to admit you died.</v>

2529
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sad thing to sit through.</v>

2530
01:54:44.781 --> 01:54:47.480
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're real experts who know a</v>

2531
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:49.610
<v Speaker 2>lot about the actual origins of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2532
01:54:49.611 --> 01:54:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is just that I don't take</v>

2533
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.230
<v Speaker 2>the commonalities between different sets</v>
<v Speaker 2>of religious beliefs as evidence for</v>

2534
01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:59.990
<v Speaker 2>anything other than there's a very human</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to invent.</v>

2535
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:05.590
<v Speaker 2>People search for meaning and they take</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning from what or whatever religion</v>

2536
01:55:07.971 --> 01:55:12.971
<v Speaker 2>or ideology that they subscribe to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use it as a sort of a reason why</v>

2537
01:55:16.581 --> 01:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>they're living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives them hope.</v>

2538
01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It gives them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them something.</v>

2539
01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very common theme among religious</v>

2540
01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:28.550
<v Speaker 2>thinkers that if it weren't for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of god or whatever,</v>

2541
01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 2>there'd be no reason to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be no reason to be a good person</v>

2542
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:32.900
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2543
01:55:32.901 --> 01:55:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the motivation we have</v>

2544
01:55:36.021 --> 01:55:38.240
<v Speaker 2>as having bodies versus being in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

2545
01:55:38.241 --> 01:55:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Like there's plenty of reasons to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

2546
01:55:40.671 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the big picture.</v>

2547
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 2>My last book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot about,</v>

2548
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2549
01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:46.510
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2550
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:50.670
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to admit that we as human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings have desires that we,</v>

2551
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 2>there are things we care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we want to be true.</v>

2552
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 2>And you can talk about why that's true</v>
<v Speaker 2>from evolution,</v>

2553
01:55:56.311 --> 01:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>from biology and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter why in some sense</v>

2554
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:01.920
<v Speaker 2>we have goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not completely aimless.</v>

2555
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Like we want to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to flourish.</v>

2556
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:06.870
<v Speaker 2>We want to be friends with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to have families or whatever it</v>

2557
01:56:06.871 --> 01:56:11.871
<v Speaker 2>is we want to do all that we put</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in terms of morality and ethics</v>

2558
01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.540
<v Speaker 2>and meaning and purpose comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking hard and carefully,</v>

2559
01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.960
<v Speaker 2>hopefully about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2560
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.980
<v Speaker 2>how to systematize and grow those</v>
<v Speaker 2>existing desires that we have into a way</v>

2561
01:56:25.171 --> 01:56:28.200
<v Speaker 2>of living in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need anything external to make</v>

2562
01:56:28.201 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just need to sort of think about</v>

2563
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:32.910
<v Speaker 2>where we are already and try to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2564
01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.800
<v Speaker 3>But you as an intelligent person who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>also an atheist who thinks very deeply</v>

2565
01:56:38.961 --> 01:56:43.961
<v Speaker 3>about things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you cling to as a purpose for</v>

2566
01:56:45.291 --> 01:56:47.960
<v Speaker 3>life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have one to have like,</v>

2567
01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you sit and think like,</v>

2568
01:56:49.881 --> 01:56:52.010
<v Speaker 3>what's the point of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

2569
01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.260
<v Speaker 3>do you.</v>

2570
01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a monolithic purpose.</v>

2571
01:56:55.661 --> 01:56:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I have plenty of intermediate sized</v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>

2572
01:56:57.791 --> 01:56:59.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2573
01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:00.191
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2574
01:57:00.191 --> 01:57:01.720
<v Speaker 2>why continue living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

2575
01:57:01.721 --> 01:57:04.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of things I want to do to</v>

2576
01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:06.160
<v Speaker 2>achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience,</v>

2577
01:57:06.190 --> 01:57:08.110
<v Speaker 2>to share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give to the world,</v>

2578
01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's big</v>

2579
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:09.961
<v Speaker 3>feature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2580
01:57:09.961 --> 01:57:12.380
<v Speaker 3>They give to the world that you're your</v>
<v Speaker 3>inner ear,</v>

2581
01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:15.930
<v Speaker 3>the way you interact with other human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and your effect on other human</v>

2582
01:57:15.931 --> 01:57:18.990
<v Speaker 3>beings gives you a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you purpose.</v>

2583
01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if I think that when I die,</v>

2584
01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I will no longer exist in my feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't matter.</v>

2585
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I have feelings right now about what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world would be like even after I'm not</v>

2586
01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:29.040
<v Speaker 2>here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2587
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.780
<v Speaker 2>So I can still be motivated to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world a better place in ways that will</v>

2588
01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.420
<v Speaker 2>outlive me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I think that when I die,</v>

2589
01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it's really the end for me.</v>

2590
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you get down sometimes?</v>

2591
01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get like these periods of like,</v>

2592
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the purpose of all this?</v>

2593
01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you see some ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in the news or some horrific</v>

2594
01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 3>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm</v>

2595
01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:56.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2596
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:59.470
<v Speaker 2>so for horrific tragedies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2597
01:57:59.530 --> 01:58:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2598
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:01.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:06.620
<v Speaker 2>fortunate enough to be a pretty even</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeled when it comes to that stuff I</v>

2600
01:58:06.621 --> 01:58:08.780
<v Speaker 2>don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't struggle with depression or</v>

2601
01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:11.570
<v Speaker 2>despair or existential anxiety or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

2602
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

2603
01:58:13.341 --> 01:58:17.360
<v Speaker 2>when I was first starting thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe and science and things like</v>

2604
01:58:17.361 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would start wondering about,</v>

2605
01:58:19.701 --> 01:58:21.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if the universe hadn't existed at</v>

2606
01:58:21.321 --> 01:58:22.610
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I weren't,</v>

2607
01:58:22.690 --> 01:58:24.040
<v Speaker 2>wasn't here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2608
01:58:24.041 --> 01:58:27.950
<v Speaker 2>and that may be loose sleep that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think like many people there,</v>

2609
01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:32.510
<v Speaker 2>there was a very definite moment when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that I and everyone I knew</v>

2610
01:58:32.511 --> 01:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>would die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2611
01:58:33.651 --> 01:58:35.870
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I woke up crying and my mom had to,</v>

2612
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:38.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comfort me because like,</v>

2613
01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2614
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 2>grand mom's gonna die and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die and I'm going to die.</v>

2615
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:43.550
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2616
01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:44.381
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2617
01:58:44.381 --> 01:58:45.510
<v Speaker 2>as a grownup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2618
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2619
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more or less.</v>

2620
01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 2>So once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the future podcast guests that,</v>

2621
01:58:52.710 --> 01:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be a next week's podcast will be by</v>

2622
01:58:56.831 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 2>a woman who was part of the death</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive movement.</v>

2623
01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2624
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:03.830
<v Speaker 2>this is real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2625
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't distinguish,</v>

2626
01:59:06.341 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't confuse it.</v>

2627
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There is a whole movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an anti natal this movie or</v>

2628
01:59:09.791 --> 01:59:11.050
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget what they call themselves,</v>

2629
01:59:11.051 --> 01:59:13.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's a whole movement that wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings not to exist.</v>

2630
01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.170
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are people who like that the</v>

2631
01:59:17.171 --> 01:59:18.740
<v Speaker 2>death positive movement is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>

2632
01:59:18.741 --> 01:59:21.190
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should face up to it,</v>

2633
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:26.850
<v Speaker 2>we should accept it and we should deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it in a personally and culturally</v>

2634
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:29.980
<v Speaker 2>positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

2635
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:31.780
<v Speaker 2>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the United States,</v>

2636
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:34.150
<v Speaker 2>even compared to europe or other</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

2637
01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.190
<v Speaker 2>we're terrible at dealing with death.</v>

2638
01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:40.270
<v Speaker 2>We put people in hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take them away from their families,</v>

2639
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 2>away from their homes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We refuse to admit that they're going to</v>

2640
01:59:44.141 --> 01:59:47.650
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we treat it as if the whole purpose</v>

2641
01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:51.280
<v Speaker 2>of the game is to squeeze out as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>more hours of life as possible,</v>

2642
01:59:51.281 --> 01:59:53.350
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality of that life is,</v>

2643
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:56.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that is just rubbish.</v>

2644
01:59:56.081 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 2>And we should be much more grown up</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2645
01:59:58.451 --> 02:00:00.610
<v Speaker 2>We should plan ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2646
02:00:00.611 --> 02:00:01.460
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2647
02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:04.390
<v Speaker 2>obama suggested that in the healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

2648
02:00:04.391 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 2>there should be some planning for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when you die.</v>

2649
02:00:07.361 --> 02:00:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Sarah pailin came along with death</v>
<v Speaker 2>panels and that was a very effective</v>

2650
02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.230
<v Speaker 2>rhetorical strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to think about the fact</v>

2651
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:16.330
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to plan for it.</v>

2652
02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>If we did plan for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be better.</v>

2653
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:22.690
<v Speaker 2>We could die at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could die with less pain,</v>

2654
02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.620
<v Speaker 2>we might not live as long as we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do every single medical</v>

2655
02:00:26.621 --> 02:00:29.500
<v Speaker 2>intervention possible just to squeeze</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a few more breaths.</v>

2656
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:34.830
<v Speaker 2>But it could be a much more life</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirming experience to die because the</v>

2657
02:00:35.201 --> 02:00:37.630
<v Speaker 2>people around us who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are there,</v>

2658
02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come across with an acceptance of what's</v>

2659
02:00:40.511 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 2>going on rather than the feeling that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should just do everything we can to</v>

2660
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:44.194
<v Speaker 2>prevent.</v>

2661
02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I had a similar situation happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently with a dog of mine who was a</v>

2662
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:53.760
<v Speaker 3>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached 13 years old and from massive.</v>

2663
02:00:53.761 --> 02:00:58.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's very old and we had to put him</v>
<v Speaker 3>down because he couldn't walk anymore.</v>

2664
02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.730
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2665
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:05.370
<v Speaker 3>it was brutally painful to watch him try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get up and fall down and,</v>

2666
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:07.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2667
02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:12.300
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things I was thinking was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if this is my grandfather and not</v>

2668
02:01:12.301 --> 02:01:17.070
<v Speaker 3>my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to watch him suffer until</v>

2669
02:01:17.071 --> 02:01:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the bitter end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I knew this dog wasn't going to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards in time and become a puppy</v>

2671
02:01:21.991 --> 02:01:22.950
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2672
02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:26.550
<v Speaker 3>And knew his days were numbered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't do anything.</v>

2673
02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Most days he just slept all day until it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was time to eat.</v>

2674
02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.790
<v Speaker 3>But it was getting to the point where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to carry him to his food.</v>

2675
02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I knew that</v>

2676
02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2677
02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:36.870
<v Speaker 2>No quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ANd it's,</v>

2678
02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:39.320
<v Speaker 2>in some sense it's even harder with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog because you can't talk them.</v>

2679
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't explain to them what's going</v>

2680
02:01:40.911 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't explain to you what their</v>

2681
02:01:42.171 --> 02:01:44.750
<v Speaker 2>wishes are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be the responsible one.</v>

2682
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:47.810
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything legally and culturally in</v>

2683
02:01:47.811 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>the United States is we're not allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to relieve that pain or that,</v>

2684
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 2>that despair that you have in the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

2685
02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Some states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including California,</v>

2686
02:01:56.901 --> 02:02:01.370
<v Speaker 2>are passing death with dignity laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>where basically it's what used to be</v>

2687
02:02:01.371 --> 02:02:03.680
<v Speaker 2>called assisted suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't call it that anymore.</v>

2688
02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A doctor is allowed to give you the</v>

2689
02:02:07.881 --> 02:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>means to end your own life when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're near,</v>

2690
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to be near a point of no</v>
<v Speaker 2>return,</v>

2691
02:02:12.771 --> 02:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>but still clearly thinking enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to make that decision</v>

2692
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:20.650
<v Speaker 3>for yourself and there's also an issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our real concern is their fear and</v>

2693
02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 3>their this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this experience being this terrifying</v>

2694
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:33.550
<v Speaker 3>sort of step into the great beyond and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tool to mitigate that and the</v>

2695
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.430
<v Speaker 3>tool that has been shown to mitigate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that as psychedelics.</v>

2696
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 3>One of the big ones being psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psilocybin has a remarkable effect on</v>

2697
02:02:45.441 --> 02:02:50.441
<v Speaker 3>people that are going through stage four</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer and a johns hopkins is studied</v>

2698
02:02:51.111 --> 02:02:51.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2699
02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:54.950
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a few studies that have</v>

2700
02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 3>shown that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you give them psilocybin,</v>

2701
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:03.730
<v Speaker 3>they they're much more relaxed and much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more comfortable with this idea of</v>

2702
02:03:05.091 --> 02:03:07.730
<v Speaker 3>ending this life of this life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2703
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:09.800
<v Speaker 3>it's gone through its course and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2704
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 3>It's an inevitable thing and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>our biological limitations that are</v>

2705
02:03:14.481 --> 02:03:19.481
<v Speaker 3>terrified and sparking up all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense primal fears of the end.</v>

2706
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:22.700
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a 100 percent in agreement</v>

2707
02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.980
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife jennifer will lead to is a</v>

2708
02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:27.740
<v Speaker 2>science writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called me and myself and</v>

2709
02:03:27.741 --> 02:03:31.250
<v Speaker 2>why searching for the science of self</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2710
02:03:31.251 --> 02:03:32.600
<v Speaker 2>one of our friends said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2711
02:03:32.601 --> 02:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna write a book about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>self,</v>

2712
02:03:33.791 --> 02:03:37.940
<v Speaker 2>you got to do lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we did and she researched it.</v>

2713
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating history,</v>

2714
02:03:40.251 --> 02:03:40.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2715
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eldest huxley,</v>

2716
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know about how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole story and he took lsd to do</v>

2717
02:03:46.581 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 2>exactly this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had throat cancer and it completely</v>

2718
02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 2>helped you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never fun to die,</v>

2719
02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:54.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it absolutely helped ease that</v>

2720
02:03:54.591 --> 02:03:59.591
<v Speaker 2>journey in a very simple way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just as we are a sort of immature</v>

2721
02:04:00.051 --> 02:04:05.000
<v Speaker 2>society that doesn't want to face up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of our eventual deaths were</v>

2722
02:04:05.001 --> 02:04:08.090
<v Speaker 2>also very culturally conservative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeamish about drugs.</v>

2723
02:04:08.091 --> 02:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so were.</v>

2724
02:04:09.611 --> 02:04:12.530
<v Speaker 2>We don't even let people do research on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these drugs.</v>

2725
02:04:12.531 --> 02:04:13.670
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2726
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of growing up to do when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to,</v>

2727
02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:18.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just living a good life,</v>

2728
02:04:18.381 --> 02:04:20.900
<v Speaker 2>but also having a good death and also so</v>

2729
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:25.480
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to actual scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have studied these compounds and</v>

2730
02:04:25.481 --> 02:04:30.481
<v Speaker 3>really understand what the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them are and have researched them deeply</v>

2731
02:04:30.731 --> 02:04:33.510
<v Speaker 3>and have personal experiences with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're saying these,</v>

2732
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:36.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things have been demonized and</v>

2733
02:04:36.401 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 3>there are tools that we can use</v>

2734
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>to sort of mitigate a lot of the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that we have,</v>

2735
02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>whether it's culturally or personally</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these transitionary times,</v>

2736
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>like death is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that we know it's inevitable,</v>

2737
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what the main problem would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be with someone taking psilocybin before</v>

2738
02:04:53.611 --> 02:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>they die and letting them ease their way</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this.</v>

2739
02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same reaction that doesn't want</v>

2740
02:05:00.421 --> 02:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>people to have a basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2741
02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>There is a sort of moral feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're weak.</v>

2742
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't struggle against dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2743
02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2744
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It's no sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

2745
02:05:12.331 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that,</v>

2746
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the universal basic income topic is</v>

2747
02:05:18.871 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>one of those knee jerk reaction or</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics that I,</v>

2748
02:05:21.121 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend eddie wong,</v>

2749
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>have introduced it to me for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I,</v>

2750
02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>my initial knee jerk reaction was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2751
02:05:28.771 --> 02:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that to people.</v>

2752
02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to get lazy.</v>

2753
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>And then the more I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2754
02:05:34.051 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just cover their food and their</v>

2755
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they really going to get,</v>

2756
02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>is it really going to kill their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition?</v>

2757
02:05:40.381 --> 02:05:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Like why would that kill it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is our own ambition,</v>

2758
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>our ambition uniquely tied to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

2759
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.840
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2760
02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same weird thing that people</v>

2761
02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>use against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2762
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>having a progressive tax system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we have,</v>

2763
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:57.660
<v Speaker 1>we tax people's money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't want to work anymore,</v>

2764
02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

2765
02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you still want more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't them so much that you have less</v>

2766
02:06:02.341 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 1>money to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

2767
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so but,</v>

2768
02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but also for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the universal basic income stuff,</v>

2769
02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I think people have to reconcile</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2770
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:15.180
<v Speaker 1>So what if someone wants to just sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and play video games all day,</v>

2771
02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the worst thing in the world?</v>

2772
02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:18.083
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2773
02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that there will be people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2774
02:06:20.101 --> 02:06:24.450
<v Speaker 1>There will still be other people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to write poetry and build sailboats</v>

2775
02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a spacecraft,</v>

2776
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or build artificial intelligence.</v>

2777
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if everyone could do whatever they</v>

2778
02:06:30.961 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 1>want when they were kids when they're 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

2779
02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:34.620
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were taught a good programming</v>

2780
02:06:34.621 --> 02:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>language and could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:37.740
<v Speaker 1>make up whatever apps and programs they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

2782
02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Like there'll be a whole different world</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what we live in right now.</v>

2783
02:06:41.250 --> 02:06:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And it might be very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2784
02:06:43.051 --> 02:06:48.000
<v Speaker 1>creatively it could possibly expand a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people's potentials,</v>

2785
02:06:48.001 --> 02:06:50.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they no longer have to have a job.</v>

2786
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:55.410
<v Speaker 1>So they could do whatever this one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're thinking about doing.</v>

2787
02:06:55.410 --> 02:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Write a book or a screenplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop something in the short term.</v>

2788
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if a basic income work sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of economically,</v>

2789
02:07:02.791 --> 02:07:06.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if we believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more and more stuff that can be</v>

2790
02:07:06.271 --> 02:07:09.660
<v Speaker 1>done by computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by robots or whatever automation,</v>

2791
02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 1>then it's absolutely something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be taken seriously.</v>

2792
02:07:12.781 --> 02:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that this is the whole thing,</v>

2793
02:07:14.641 --> 02:07:17.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is great because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking a lot of different angles about</v>

2794
02:07:17.281 --> 02:07:22.281
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the shape of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing in a way that makes what it</v>

2795
02:07:22.471 --> 02:07:25.350
<v Speaker 1>means to be human changing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2796
02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:28.720
<v Speaker 1>facing up to what those changes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we died,</v>

2797
02:07:28.721 --> 02:07:30.810
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make up purpose and meaning for</v>

2798
02:07:30.811 --> 02:07:35.811
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and in our lives and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we are physically in terms</v>

2799
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.280
<v Speaker 2>of bodies and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and machines and so forth is Also</v>

2800
02:07:39.281 --> 02:07:41.920
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this part of the theme of my</v>

2801
02:07:41.921 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope is that,</v>

2802
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think through some of these issues to</v>

2803
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:47.590
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answers,</v>

2804
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but I want to ask the questions about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2805
02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:50.850
<v Speaker 2>who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're living,</v>

2806
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>what should we be doing about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because god's not going to give us the</v>

2807
02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2808
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2809
02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 3>podcasts like yours and I mean any</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts where people are really</v>

2810
02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:06.460
<v Speaker 3>carefully considering issues there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's important about them that</v>

2811
02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:11.860
<v Speaker 3>really didn't exist before is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone can sort of digest these very</v>

2812
02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:17.951
<v Speaker 3>complex subjects through to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation about it that</v>

2813
02:08:18.261 --> 02:08:23.030
<v Speaker 3>perhaps are more informed and have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>data and have more experience and have</v>

2814
02:08:23.031 --> 02:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>more thought about these particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2815
02:08:26.210 --> 02:08:30.050
<v Speaker 3>So what you can do and what sam harris</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do in a lot of people can do that</v>

2816
02:08:30.051 --> 02:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>are creating these podcasts about these</v>
<v Speaker 3>really complex issues,</v>

2817
02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:37.871
<v Speaker 3>is you start that conversation and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>seed gets planted into someone's head</v>

2818
02:08:38.901 --> 02:08:41.360
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they carry with them at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They carry with them,</v>

2819
02:08:41.690 --> 02:08:44.900
<v Speaker 3>carry it with them when they're on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>subway or during the commute home,</v>

2820
02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.380
<v Speaker 3>and then they become a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>broader conversation that we have as a</v>

2821
02:08:48.381 --> 02:08:48.930
<v Speaker 3>couple.</v>

2822
02:08:48.930 --> 02:08:49.651
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2823
02:08:49.651 --> 02:08:53.970
<v Speaker 2>and that'S why I sort of want to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>draw a distinction between science and</v>

2824
02:08:53.971 --> 02:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>other ways of thinking deeply about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2825
02:08:56.191 --> 02:08:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Because I want people to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2826
02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often said this as a joke,</v>

2827
02:09:00.571 --> 02:09:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to live in a world where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>work hard in the factory and they go out</v>

2828
02:09:04.411 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>for a drink afterwards and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>their favorite interpretation of quantum</v>

2829
02:09:07.171 --> 02:09:08.070
<v Speaker 2>mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2830
02:09:08.690 --> 02:09:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I want that to be the kind of thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are bullshitting about,</v>

2831
02:09:11.941 --> 02:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over beer.</v>

2832
02:09:13.110 --> 02:09:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a world I want to live in is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2833
02:09:15.230 --> 02:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever run into a quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics conversation at a bar?</v>

2834
02:09:18.690 --> 02:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>There are far too many people who think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand something about quantum</v>

2835
02:09:21.181 --> 02:09:22.650
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and are going to explain it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2836
02:09:22.651 --> 02:09:27.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'm at the existing conversations to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a little bit more informed.</v>

2837
02:09:27.710 --> 02:09:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's.</v>

2838
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:30.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a few people online.</v>

2839
02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Someone has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get this guy on and then I've</v>

2840
02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 3>listened to them talk and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure</v>

2841
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>that that guy's full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't really point out how I know</v>

2842
02:09:40.711 --> 02:09:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but feel free to email me.</v>

2843
02:09:42.751 --> 02:09:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I will help you out if a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2844
02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bring this one guy up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2845
02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:48.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'll talk to you about it the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2846
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of woo out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it's quantum mechanics,</v>

2847
02:09:52.141 --> 02:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of very respectable people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound crazy if you don't know too deeply</v>

2848
02:09:56.011 --> 02:09:56.970
<v Speaker 2>what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying.</v>

2849
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So that is the fineman quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2850
02:09:59.521 --> 02:10:01.230
<v Speaker 2>If you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know quantum mechanics,</v>

2851
02:10:01.231 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you definitely don't know quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics exactly.</v>

2852
02:10:03.090 --> 02:10:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Which is the whole point of my book is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to overcome that feeling because I think</v>

2853
02:10:07.531 --> 02:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2854
02:10:08.761 --> 02:10:11.520
<v Speaker 2>it's true that we don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We physicists don't agree in what</v>

2855
02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we now fetishize the fact that we</v>

2856
02:10:15.781 --> 02:10:16.530
<v Speaker 2>don't understand it.</v>

2857
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Like it's good that we don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2858
02:10:18.330 --> 02:10:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Like if you try to understand it too</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

2859
02:10:20.251 --> 02:10:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you're wasting your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2860
02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I so disagree with that view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the quantum mechanics is and</v>

2861
02:10:26.671 --> 02:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>should be understandable by everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a squirrely concept.</v>

2862
02:10:30.930 --> 02:10:31.980
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2863
02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:10:33.250 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 2>It's weird and that's why I'm a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2865
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:39.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people who I know who</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends of mine who are professors in</v>

2866
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:44.651
<v Speaker 2>philosophy departments because they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phd in physics and they realized what</v>

2867
02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>they really wanted to do was to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about quantum mechanics in a deep way</v>

2868
02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.260
<v Speaker 2>and they would never get a job in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics department doing that to put</v>

2869
02:10:51.261 --> 02:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>philosophy would let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

2870
02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2871
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>And what they're really doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

2872
02:10:57.590 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers are happy with and</v>

2873
02:11:00.141 --> 02:11:00.590
<v Speaker 2>physicists.</v>

2874
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:05.450
<v Speaker 2>And what year did the concept of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics become invented?</v>

2875
02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Invented in test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it started in 1900.</v>

2876
02:11:08.781 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they sort of perfected the modern</v>

2877
02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 2>version around 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27.</v>

2878
02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:16.790
<v Speaker 2>What was the original thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know?</v>

2879
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

2880
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The history is amazing and a messy</v>

2881
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.300
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't have so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdness going on.</v>

2882
02:11:26.301 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It was max plunk plunk radiation if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard of that.</v>

2883
02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a german physicist.</v>

2884
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So black body radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something glows when you heat it up.</v>

2885
02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what happens when you heat</v>

2886
02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 2>something up is all the atoms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules start vibrating.</v>

2887
02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:46.670
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of charged particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A charged particle has an electric field</v>

2888
02:11:46.730 --> 02:11:48.320
<v Speaker 2>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you vibrate it,</v>

2889
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:52.040
<v Speaker 2>the electric field starts vibrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call that light or radiation,</v>

2890
02:11:52.041 --> 02:11:52.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gravity.</v>

2891
02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Electromagnetic waves are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitted.</v>

2892
02:11:55.850 --> 02:12:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So you could in the year 1900,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could sit down and do a calculation.</v>

2893
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:01.710
<v Speaker 2>What should that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2894
02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>if you heed everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much radiation should it give off?</v>

2895
02:12:05.330 --> 02:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>And there the problem was it should give</v>
<v Speaker 2>off an infant amount of radiation at</v>

2896
02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>very long wavelength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously false,</v>

2897
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously not how things really</v>

2898
02:12:13.251 --> 02:12:16.280
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was this blatant disagreement</v>

2899
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.280
<v Speaker 2>between everything we thought we knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the late 19th century,</v>

2900
02:12:21.281 --> 02:12:25.130
<v Speaker 2>in the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people really thought in physics that</v>

2901
02:12:25.131 --> 02:12:27.260
<v Speaker 2>they were close to the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2902
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:30.830
<v Speaker 2>They had a picture where there were</v>
<v Speaker 2>particles like electrons and protons.</v>

2903
02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And then there were fields like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic field and the</v>

2904
02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 2>gravitational field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the particles were matter and the</v>

2905
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:38.900
<v Speaker 2>fields push them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They interacted,</v>

2906
02:12:38.901 --> 02:12:39.270
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2907
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 2>they were the forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2908
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:45.020
<v Speaker 2>And this picture was so good and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling that people were basically</v>

2909
02:12:45.021 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're almost done with physics,</v>

2910
02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:47.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2911
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:50.720
<v Speaker 2>We almost have it all figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there were a couple of little</v>

2912
02:12:50.721 --> 02:12:53.720
<v Speaker 2>things like the black body radiation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you made a prediction.</v>

2913
02:12:53.721 --> 02:12:55.580
<v Speaker 2>It was wildly off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>

2914
02:12:55.581 --> 02:12:56.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen?</v>

2915
02:12:56.361 --> 02:13:00.500
<v Speaker 2>So plonk says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe when this electromagnetic</v>

2916
02:13:00.501 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 2>radiation is admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a continual stream of</v>

2917
02:13:03.771 --> 02:13:06.380
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if like individual little packets</v>

2918
02:13:06.381 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 2>of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had no reason to say that.</v>

2919
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just out of the blue is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled out of his butt.</v>

2920
02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was just sitting there with a pad.</v>

2921
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just contemplate and think what if.</v>

2922
02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:18.890
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if he gets exactly the right</v>

2923
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:19.850
<v Speaker 2>answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2924
02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:20.961
<v Speaker 2>The data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2925
02:13:20.961 --> 02:13:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

2926
02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he public and he,</v>

2927
02:13:24.081 --> 02:13:26.810
<v Speaker 2>he himself wasn't sure what to make of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2928
02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this idea.</v>

2929
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It gives the right answer.</v>

2930
02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

2931
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 2>And it was five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young man named albert einstein said,</v>

2932
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going on.</v>

2933
02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Those little packets of energy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

2934
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.580
<v Speaker 2>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that light is not a wave.</v>

2935
02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:44.460
<v Speaker 2>There's particles that are being given</v>
<v Speaker 2>off photons,</v>

2936
02:13:44.461 --> 02:13:45.870
<v Speaker 2>would they relate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are called right?</v>

2937
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he won the nobel prize</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

2938
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never won a nobel prize for</v>

2939
02:13:49.411 --> 02:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won the nobel prize for inventing</v>

2940
02:13:51.871 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>photons basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2941
02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was that.</v>

2942
02:13:56.431 --> 02:13:58.260
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were two tracks going on.</v>

2943
02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Remember I just said in the 19th</v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

2944
02:14:00.151 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 2>it was the world's made of particles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields.</v>

2945
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:05.430
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that happened is</v>
<v Speaker 2>people started thinking about these</v>

2946
02:14:05.431 --> 02:14:06.870
<v Speaker 2>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic field.</v>

2947
02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:07.770
<v Speaker 2>And einstein saYs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2948
02:14:07.771 --> 02:14:09.870
<v Speaker 2>there's something a little bit particle</v>
<v Speaker 2>like about it,</v>

2949
02:14:10.230 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is not a hardened from distinction.</v>

2950
02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Then separately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at adam's right?</v>

2951
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:20.190
<v Speaker 2>So you have a electron orbiting and adam</v>
<v Speaker 2>orbiting the nucleus of an atom.</v>

2952
02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:22.560
<v Speaker 2>You have this picture that everyone has</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen the cartoon of an atom,</v>

2953
02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:24.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the electron orbiting around.</v>

2954
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a prediction.</v>

2955
02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:31.260
<v Speaker 2>That electron moving around the nucleus</v>
<v Speaker 2>of anatomies should be giving off light.</v>

2956
02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a moving electron when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you accelerate and electronic gives</v>

2957
02:14:34.471 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 2>off light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it should lose energy and spiral into</v>

2958
02:14:37.981 --> 02:14:40.260
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should not just stay in the same</v>

2959
02:14:40.261 --> 02:14:42.350
<v Speaker 2>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be losing energy by radiating</v>

2960
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:43.650
<v Speaker 2>energy away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

2961
02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>You can calculate for a typical adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long should it take before the adam</v>

2962
02:14:48.101 --> 02:14:52.200
<v Speaker 2>shrinks to zero size and the answer is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hundred billion to of a second.</v>

2963
02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:57.240
<v Speaker 2>So all the atoms that you and I are made</v>
<v Speaker 2>of should just go right away.</v>

2964
02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Rapper that break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give off light and squint.</v>

2965
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Scrunch down to zero size.</v>

2966
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:03.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2967
02:15:03.031 --> 02:15:04.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not compatible with the data.</v>

2968
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:09.450
<v Speaker 2>So niels bohr in 1913 ish comes along</v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

2969
02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:12.360
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if the electrons don't do that?</v>

2970
02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Because they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if there's certain orbits that</v>

2971
02:15:15.811 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to have and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to have any other ones?</v>

2972
02:15:18.450 --> 02:15:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulled out of nowhere for no good</v>

2973
02:15:21.181 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he says,</v>

2974
02:15:22.801 --> 02:15:24.900
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I predict the following,</v>

2975
02:15:24.930 --> 02:15:27.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of radiation from hydrogen.</v>

2976
02:15:27.151 --> 02:15:27.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look it up,</v>

2977
02:15:27.751 --> 02:15:29.370
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fits the data,</v>

2978
02:15:29.371 --> 02:15:32.310
<v Speaker 2>perfect jesus and people like what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell is going on?</v>

2979
02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:35.820
<v Speaker 2>and then it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that took like another 10,</v>

2980
02:15:35.821 --> 02:15:40.080
<v Speaker 2>15 years before people like heisenberg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and schrodinger built that up into</v>

2981
02:15:40.081 --> 02:15:45.081
<v Speaker 2>saying it's not just that waves of light</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a certain particle illness.</v>

2982
02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 2>It's also that particles like electrons</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a certain waviness and there's a</v>

2983
02:15:50.221 --> 02:15:53.340
<v Speaker 2>wave function and they're getting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics and we're still</v>

2984
02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:54.420
<v Speaker 2>arguing about it to this day.</v>

2985
02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a difficult concept to wrap</v>

2986
02:15:58.591 --> 02:16:00.480
<v Speaker 2>your head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been distorted,</v>

2987
02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2988
02:16:02.090 --> 02:16:04.740
<v Speaker 2>especially in the womb merchants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

2989
02:16:04.741 --> 02:16:08.820
<v Speaker 2>a fun part of my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I list like 20 titles that came up in</v>

2990
02:16:08.821 --> 02:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you type the word quantum in</v>

2991
02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 2>quantum love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum power,</v>

2992
02:16:13.351 --> 02:16:14.880
<v Speaker 2>quantum yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum healing,</v>

2993
02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.040
<v Speaker 2>quantum politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum theology,</v>

2994
02:16:17.041 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's used for every crazy bit of</v>

2995
02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:22.980
<v Speaker 2>nonsense that you've ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you mitigate that?</v>

2996
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Write more books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more podcasts,</v>

2997
02:16:25.411 --> 02:16:26.250
<v Speaker 2>keep talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2998
02:16:26.251 --> 02:16:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never get rid of it entirely</v>

2999
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you may have heard,</v>

3000
02:16:30.251 --> 02:16:31.930
<v Speaker 2>there are people who still believe the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth is flat.</v>

3001
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard,</v>

3002
02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 2>so you're never going to completely get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of the wrong ideas,</v>

3003
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:39.970
<v Speaker 2>but you can get the right ideas out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there more effectively.</v>

3004
02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's possible that.</v>

3005
02:16:44.690 --> 02:16:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean this concept was created and</v>
<v Speaker 3>invented somewhere around the 19</v>

3006
02:16:49.221 --> 02:16:51.980
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that another theory</v>

3007
02:16:51.981 --> 02:16:56.981
<v Speaker 3>that's just as revolutionary is being</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed right now and through things</v>

3008
02:16:57.741 --> 02:17:02.741
<v Speaker 3>like the large hadron collider and</v>
<v Speaker 3>search for understanding the elementary</v>

3009
02:17:03.531 --> 02:17:07.880
<v Speaker 3>particles of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that we could develop a</v>

3010
02:17:07.881 --> 02:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>new theory and are there any that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>being contemplated right now,</v>

3011
02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:16.520
<v Speaker 2>so it's absolutely possible that what</v>
<v Speaker 2>einstein and tried his best to do right?</v>

3012
02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:18.900
<v Speaker 2>He thought that he could do better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics and he did not</v>

3013
02:17:18.901 --> 02:17:23.901
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big difference is that when real</v>

3014
02:17:25.021 --> 02:17:27.390
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics was developed between</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,990,</v>

3015
02:17:27.391 --> 02:17:31.320
<v Speaker 2>27 at every step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was because there was some dramatic</v>

3016
02:17:31.321 --> 02:17:36.321
<v Speaker 2>disagreement between the theory and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data and right now our theories are good</v>

3017
02:17:36.481 --> 02:17:38.460
<v Speaker 2>enough that they fit the data really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

3018
02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:40.590
<v Speaker 2>So we're trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3019
02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I and others are proposIng new ideas to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to understand,</v>

3020
02:17:43.801 --> 02:17:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how spacetime emerges in quantum</v>

3021
02:17:46.021 --> 02:17:48.810
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and things like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can try to do better than quantum</v>

3022
02:17:48.811 --> 02:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all just on pure principle,</v>

3023
02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>right on pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coherence and beauty and elegance</v>

3024
02:17:56.371 --> 02:17:59.010
<v Speaker 2>because we have a theory that fits the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data fine.</v>

3025
02:17:59.130 --> 02:18:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's so much harder to make progress</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to do it in your</v>

3026
02:18:02.521 --> 02:18:04.140
<v Speaker 2>brain rather than doing it by data.</v>

3027
02:18:04.450 --> 02:18:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as for right now,</v>

3028
02:18:08.290 --> 02:18:10.690
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else being contemplated</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3029
02:18:10.770 --> 02:18:11.603
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty unique.</v>

3030
02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Is being contemplated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing promising.</v>

3031
02:18:13.331 --> 02:18:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

3032
02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:16.750
<v Speaker 2>nothing emergent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are people who think they can</v>

3033
02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 2>do better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no one who agrees that someone</v>

3034
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:20.720
<v Speaker 2>else is doing better right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3035
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Are there any standout theories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have sort of,</v>

3036
02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I think replacing quantum mechanics or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even improving quantum mechanics is</v>

3037
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:33.100
<v Speaker 2>because there's no guidance whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>from experiments.</v>

3038
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not even a sort of leading</v>

3039
02:18:35.831 --> 02:18:36.940
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3040
02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the right way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that given right now,</v>

3041
02:18:39.970 --> 02:18:43.450
<v Speaker 2>given the fact that we have quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and yet don't quite understand</v>

3042
02:18:43.451 --> 02:18:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our job should be to understand what we</v>

3043
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:46.354
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

3044
02:18:48.250 --> 02:18:49.083
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3045
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:52.010
<v Speaker 3>what has come out of the large hadron</v>
<v Speaker 3>collider.</v>

3046
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I know that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some discussion as to whether</v>

3047
02:18:57.441 --> 02:19:01.130
<v Speaker 3>or not they found the higgs boson or</v>
<v Speaker 3>boston.</v>

3048
02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I say bows on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pose on was with a z.</v>

3049
02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:08.660
<v Speaker 3>It's pronounced with [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's spelled with a dance boo son.</v>

3050
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

3051
02:19:09.470 --> 02:19:11.510
<v Speaker 3>It's pronounced [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only read it.</v>

3052
02:19:11.511 --> 02:19:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I never had a physicist a bose on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

3053
02:19:13.821 --> 02:19:14.331
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3054
02:19:14.331 --> 02:19:19.331
<v Speaker 3>So the higgs boson there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some discussion that they had</v>

3055
02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:23.390
<v Speaker 3>absolutely proven its existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there was also some debate</v>

3056
02:19:23.391 --> 02:19:26.870
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually a very bittersweet.</v>

3057
02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 3>The large hadron</v>

3058
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.070
<v Speaker 2>collider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bittersweet.</v>

3059
02:19:30.430 --> 02:19:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3060
02:19:31.041 --> 02:19:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Life doesn't promise you a rose garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3061
02:19:35.090 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>we found the higgs boson fairly quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>after getting the large hadron collider</v>

3062
02:19:38.901 --> 02:19:41.090
<v Speaker 2>up to speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We founded in 2012.</v>

3063
02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 2>You can read that in my other book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particle at the end of the universe.</v>

3064
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't find anything else.</v>

3065
02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.490
<v Speaker 2>So did we find the higgs boson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3066
02:19:49.491 --> 02:19:53.480
<v Speaker 2>it is crystal clear that we found a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particle and that particle is exactly</v>

3067
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:58.481
<v Speaker 2>what we predicted 40 years before that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higgs boson would look like it talks</v>

3068
02:19:58.701 --> 02:20:01.610
<v Speaker 2>to the other particles in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has the right mass and has the same</v>

3069
02:20:01.611 --> 02:20:04.790
<v Speaker 2>lifetime and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is a puzzle.</v>

3070
02:20:04.850 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So this is what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have blatant disagreement</v>

3071
02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:08.450
<v Speaker 2>between theory and experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3072
02:20:08.451 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 2>we have our puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3073
02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our mismatches between our</v>

3074
02:20:13.251 --> 02:20:16.430
<v Speaker 2>informal expectation and what reality is</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3075
02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3076
02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:21.680
<v Speaker 2>so there's a number which is the mass of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higgs bozon.</v>

3077
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:23.330
<v Speaker 2>We measured it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3078
02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:26.060
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 30 some times the mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a proton.</v>

3079
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.880
<v Speaker 2>But there's a guess as to what the mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have been if,</v>

3080
02:20:29.881 --> 02:20:33.140
<v Speaker 2>if nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're natural nature is natural,</v>

3081
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but if our notion of nature have worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the way it was,</v>

3082
02:20:35.601 --> 02:20:37.430
<v Speaker 2>what should the mass of the higgs bows</v>
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>

3083
02:20:37.431 --> 02:20:39.950
<v Speaker 2>B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's literally a quadrillion times</v>

3084
02:20:39.951 --> 02:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>bigger than what it actually does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a quadrillion tended to 15.</v>

3085
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3086
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm not making this up.</v>

3087
02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:49.930
<v Speaker 2>You can google this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3088
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:53.930
<v Speaker 2>the mass of the higgs boson should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormously bigger by sort of what our</v>

3089
02:20:53.931 --> 02:20:57.020
<v Speaker 2>intuitive feelings about quantum</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and quantum field theory say.</v>

3090
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:59.420
<v Speaker 2>So there's a known problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been known for a long time called</v>

3091
02:20:59.421 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even before we discovered the</v>

3092
02:21:03.591 --> 02:21:04.880
<v Speaker 2>higgs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew it wasn't that heavy.</v>

3093
02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:07.190
<v Speaker 2>We knew as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much lighter than what it should be.</v>

3094
02:21:07.191 --> 02:21:10.040
<v Speaker 2>So the hierarchy problem was a known</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and people said,</v>

3095
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:11.390
<v Speaker 2>how could it be true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3096
02:21:11.391 --> 02:21:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to change the theory a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

3097
02:21:13.101 --> 02:21:16.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to like add some new particles</v>
<v Speaker 2>or predict some new features,</v>

3098
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 2>a physics going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many,</v>

3099
02:21:19.191 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself included,</v>

3100
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:24.800
<v Speaker 2>we're very optimistic that the large</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadron collider would find evidence for</v>

3101
02:21:24.801 --> 02:21:27.620
<v Speaker 2>what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would find more particles than just the</v>

3102
02:21:27.621 --> 02:21:31.640
<v Speaker 2>higgs bozon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's found nothing else maybe would find</v>

3103
02:21:31.641 --> 02:21:35.750
<v Speaker 2>supersymmetry or extra dimensions or</v>
<v Speaker 2>strings or some new kinds of</v>

3104
02:21:35.751 --> 02:21:38.780
<v Speaker 2>combinations of old particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's found nothing else.</v>

3105
02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.540
<v Speaker 2>So now we have a puzzle and no answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3106
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:44.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most frustrating thing</v>

3107
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:47.120
<v Speaker 2>because they're the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3108
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:49.100
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to say this out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here we go.</v>

3109
02:21:49.101 --> 02:21:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Since no one's listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3110
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:53.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time particle physicists were</v>

3111
02:21:53.391 --> 02:21:58.391
<v Speaker 2>surprised by an experimental result from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particle accelerator was in the 19</v>

3112
02:21:58.581 --> 02:21:59.414
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

3113
02:22:00.350 --> 02:22:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Since then we found new particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were already predicted and</v>

3114
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:06.020
<v Speaker 2>expected to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never found a particle since the</v>

3115
02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:09.980
<v Speaker 2>seventies that no one had anticipated</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding long before.</v>

3116
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of a particle collider as</v>

3117
02:22:14.331 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 2>a lay person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person just looking on the outside,</v>

3118
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:21.520
<v Speaker 2>like you got to create crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet like that's the only way to find out</v>

3119
02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:25.470
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic building blocks of the</v>

3120
02:22:25.471 --> 02:22:27.300
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to rush things and knew each</v>

3121
02:22:27.301 --> 02:22:28.111
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3122
02:22:28.111 --> 02:22:28.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3123
02:22:28.711 --> 02:22:32.580
<v Speaker 2>so the secret to that is that really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is not made of particles.</v>

3124
02:22:32.581 --> 02:22:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It's really made a fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3125
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 2>That's quantum field theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laBel given to this.</v>

3126
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 2>So for the electromagnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the light coming out of the light</v>

3127
02:22:40.501 --> 02:22:41.880
<v Speaker 2>bulbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

3128
02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:44.490
<v Speaker 2>We figured out the fields first and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave down the particles later.</v>

3129
02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:46.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's also true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we were just talking about,</v>

3130
02:22:46.861 --> 02:22:49.350
<v Speaker 2>for the particles like electrons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protons,</v>

3131
02:22:49.351 --> 02:22:50.280
<v Speaker 2>quirks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrinos.</v>

3132
02:22:50.281 --> 02:22:54.090
<v Speaker 2>These are all vibrations and fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you should think about when</v>

3133
02:22:54.091 --> 02:22:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you think of colliding particles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not little pea shaped things that</v>

3134
02:22:57.690 --> 02:22:59.070
<v Speaker 2>are bumping into each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smushing,</v>

3135
02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:01.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really like a little vibration into</v>

3136
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:06.720
<v Speaker 2>fields that are coming into the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and overlapping and all the</v>

3137
02:23:06.721 --> 02:23:11.721
<v Speaker 2>particles that could potentially exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fields that are out there in the</v>

3138
02:23:11.851 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 2>world and usually they're just quietly</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there not doing anything.</v>

3139
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:19.320
<v Speaker 2>But when these particles that you made</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the large hadron collider hitting</v>

3140
02:23:19.321 --> 02:23:22.470
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sets up vibrations in every field</v>

3141
02:23:22.471 --> 02:23:24.870
<v Speaker 2>in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like very faint little jiggles up and</v>

3142
02:23:24.871 --> 02:23:27.510
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you look and you see in quantum</v>

3143
02:23:27.511 --> 02:23:30.300
<v Speaker 2>mechanics says there's a probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>will look one way versus another.</v>

3144
02:23:30.330 --> 02:23:33.630
<v Speaker 2>So the way you make it how in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a higgs boson by colliding</v>

3145
02:23:33.631 --> 02:23:35.700
<v Speaker 2>protons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the higgs boson is over a</v>

3146
02:23:35.701 --> 02:23:37.830
<v Speaker 2>hundred times heavier than a proton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3147
02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:40.680
<v Speaker 2>The answer is really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're setting up vibrations and the</v>

3148
02:23:40.681 --> 02:23:43.770
<v Speaker 2>higgs field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was always there all along,</v>

3149
02:23:44.250 --> 02:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you very quickly actually you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

3150
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:48.750
<v Speaker 2>The higgs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higgs boson disappears so quickly.</v>

3151
02:23:48.751 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 2>You'll never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what it decays into,</v>

3152
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:54.030
<v Speaker 2>you see what it converts into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vibrations and the higgs field get</v>

3153
02:23:54.031 --> 02:23:57.030
<v Speaker 2>transferred to vibrations and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that's what we observe in our</v>

3154
02:23:57.031 --> 02:23:58.490
<v Speaker 2>detector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

3155
02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 2>if you are able to do this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptual switched from particles to</v>

3156
02:24:01.231 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 2>fields than the reason why we need an</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerator and a collider to make new</v>

3157
02:24:05.521 --> 02:24:07.260
<v Speaker 2>particles begins to make a bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

3158
02:24:08.730 --> 02:24:09.760
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you?</v>

3159
02:24:10.290 --> 02:24:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it now.</v>

3160
02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 2>There was something that I had read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying one more thing.</v>

3161
02:24:16.850 --> 02:24:21.060
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a room with two pianos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you play one piano,</v>

3162
02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.880
<v Speaker 2>the piano will start vibrating along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it a little bit.</v>

3163
02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting way to look at it.</v>

3164
02:24:25.831 --> 02:24:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the one field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quarks and gluons and the proton</v>

3165
02:24:29.371 --> 02:24:32.490
<v Speaker 2>start the higgs field vibrating a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit and that's what we eventually see.</v>

3166
02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you mentioned glue on's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3167
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:37.890
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I had read</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that they did,</v>

3168
02:24:38.490 --> 02:24:43.260
<v Speaker 2>they had either discovered or were able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to observe with the large hadron</v>

3169
02:24:43.261 --> 02:24:47.790
<v Speaker 2>collider was a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called quark glue on plasma.</v>

3170
02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it right.</v>

3171
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3172
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:54.420
<v Speaker 2>which is an immensely dense thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3173
02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:58.290
<v Speaker 2>the way they described it was something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something that was a fraction of</v>

3174
02:24:58.291 --> 02:25:01.320
<v Speaker 2>the size of a sugar cube would weigh as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as the earth itself.</v>

3175
02:25:01.350 --> 02:25:02.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

3176
02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:06.990
<v Speaker 2>So usually what you try to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>particle accelerators is discovered new</v>

3177
02:25:06.991 --> 02:25:08.070
<v Speaker 2>particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3178
02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:11.670
<v Speaker 2>So to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why haven't you discovered them already?</v>

3179
02:25:11.671 --> 02:25:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's because they're too heavy.</v>

3180
02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 2>It takes energy to make them equals mc</v>
<v Speaker 2>squared.</v>

3181
02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:20.580
<v Speaker 2>If their mass is big and a lot of energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in as smallest possible region.</v>

3182
02:25:20.610 --> 02:25:23.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how you make new particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to do that,</v>

3183
02:25:23.810 --> 02:25:25.810
<v Speaker 2>you take some particles that are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

3184
02:25:25.811 --> 02:25:27.550
<v Speaker 2>like protons and you smash them</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

3185
02:25:27.551 --> 02:25:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's how we discovered the higgs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're looking for other things.</v>

3186
02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 2>But maybe your goal in life is not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discover new particles,</v>

3187
02:25:34.031 --> 02:25:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but to understand the particles that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>already know about,</v>

3188
02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:38.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that case,</v>

3189
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:39.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want to see what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

3190
02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:43.120
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge number of particles together in</v>

3191
02:25:43.121 --> 02:25:46.120
<v Speaker 2>the same place with a lot of energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how they interact with each other</v>

3192
02:25:46.121 --> 02:25:48.670
<v Speaker 2>and make a plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plasma is like what's at the center of</v>

3193
02:25:48.671 --> 02:25:49.570
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3194
02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.130
<v Speaker 2>But instead of electrons and photons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make it a quarks and</v>

3195
02:25:54.131 --> 02:25:54.964
<v Speaker 2>gluons.</v>

3196
02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:00.120
<v Speaker 2>So instead of smashing together protons</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach on has three corks each,</v>

3197
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>we smashed together the nucleus of a</v>

3198
02:26:03.491 --> 02:26:06.460
<v Speaker 2>heavy adam like an iron or lead adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3199
02:26:06.461 --> 02:26:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Which has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3200
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>dozens of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of protons and neutrons in it.</v>

3201
02:26:10.421 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 2>So we get as many particles as we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze together in the same place.</v>

3202
02:26:14.711 --> 02:26:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So the energy is a bit more diffuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we get to study how they interact</v>

3203
02:26:18.671 --> 02:26:21.130
<v Speaker 2>with each other because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions were like near the big bang.</v>

3204
02:26:21.131 --> 02:26:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Lots of particles going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just two particles smacking</v>

3205
02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:26.170
<v Speaker 2>into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're learning a lot about what</v>

3206
02:26:26.171 --> 02:26:28.510
<v Speaker 2>conditions were like in the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very early universe.</v>

3207
02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.790
<v Speaker 2>What is the mass of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This core gluon plasma,</v>

3208
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:37.830
<v Speaker 2>like there's some insane number that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading,</v>

3209
02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:40.720
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by neural implant is failing me,</v>

3210
02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:42.400
<v Speaker 2>so it's not remember the number right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

3211
02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:43.234
<v Speaker 2>but we could google it.</v>

3212
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.400
<v Speaker 2>It's very dense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic,</v>

3213
02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:47.980
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a bit of a cheat,</v>

3214
02:26:47.981 --> 02:26:48.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3215
02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:49.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always,</v>

3216
02:26:49.091 --> 02:26:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I get laughed when I give talks on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>higgs boson because uh,</v>

3217
02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned that the hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lifetime of the higgs bozon already</v>

3218
02:26:56.141 --> 02:26:57.730
<v Speaker 2>said it disappears very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3219
02:26:58.180 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So I say it's one zeptosecond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is true.</v>

3220
02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:03.660
<v Speaker 2>That's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3221
02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you when I say quadrillion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3222
02:27:05.591 --> 02:27:07.240
<v Speaker 2>what does that number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said 10 and 15,</v>

3223
02:27:07.241 --> 02:27:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the point of a zeptosecond really</v>

3224
02:27:10.511 --> 02:27:12.430
<v Speaker 2>short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I say it's a zeptosecond,</v>

3225
02:27:12.431 --> 02:27:16.870
<v Speaker 2>which is a really short period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone laughs it's 10 to the minus</v>

3226
02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:19.750
<v Speaker 2>21 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who cares if I said 10 to the minus</v>

3227
02:27:19.751 --> 02:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that have changed your opinion at</v>

3228
02:27:21.331 --> 02:27:22.510
<v Speaker 2>the expose on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any way?</v>

3229
02:27:22.511 --> 02:27:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a really short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3230
02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Like five quadrillion.</v>

3231
02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Is that more than a trillion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:27:27.430 --> 02:27:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really affect your life in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any meaningful way.</v>

3233
02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:35.970
<v Speaker 2>What is going on right now with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with science that is particularly</v>

3234
02:27:37.241 --> 02:27:39.100
<v Speaker 2>compelling to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than things we've already</v>

3235
02:27:39.101 --> 02:27:40.960
<v Speaker 2>discussed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3236
02:27:40.961 --> 02:27:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in entropy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity,</v>

3237
02:27:44.141 --> 02:27:46.030
<v Speaker 2>complex systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3238
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a wonderful place in New Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>in santa fe just called the santa fe</v>

3239
02:27:49.451 --> 02:27:51.820
<v Speaker 2>institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is devoted to the study of complex</v>

3240
02:27:51.821 --> 02:27:54.100
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physicists are really,</v>

3241
02:27:54.101 --> 02:27:57.790
<v Speaker 2>really good at studying simple systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of articles at a time,</v>

3242
02:27:57.850 --> 02:27:59.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's certain techniques they have</v>

3243
02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:01.420
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why we have theories that</v>

3244
02:28:01.421 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 2>explain all the data because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking questions about the simplest</v>

3245
02:28:04.451 --> 02:28:09.451
<v Speaker 2>possible things that we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have a bacterium or a,</v>

3246
02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>an elephant or an economic system or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>

3247
02:28:15.281 --> 02:28:17.770
<v Speaker 2>these are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex systems with many moving</v>

3248
02:28:17.771 --> 02:28:19.810
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with each other and complicated</v>

3249
02:28:19.811 --> 02:28:20.644
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

3250
02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 2>And so you can start asking yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about are there laws that</v>

3251
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:29.720
<v Speaker 2>govern the behavior of these complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that we wouldn't have noticed if</v>

3252
02:28:29.721 --> 02:28:34.721
<v Speaker 2>we just studied them piece by piece?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is a little bit yes,</v>

3253
02:28:35.650 --> 02:28:39.740
<v Speaker 2>he to keep advertising my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we had Jeffrey West on the podcast.</v>

3254
02:28:39.741 --> 02:28:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Who is hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3255
02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:41.923
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't hate it.</v>

3256
02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not actually telling you the</v>

3257
02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:46.700
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but saw through me there.</v>

3258
02:28:46.701 --> 02:28:50.300
<v Speaker 2>I love advertising my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Jeffrey West who's a brilliant</v>

3259
02:28:50.301 --> 02:28:54.860
<v Speaker 2>physicist who actually started as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particle physicist and then when we were</v>

3260
02:28:54.861 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 2>going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember,</v>

3261
02:28:56.331 --> 02:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>we were going to build the</v>
<v Speaker 2>superconducting super collider in the</v>

3262
02:28:59.001 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was going to be our version of the</v>

3263
02:29:00.951 --> 02:29:05.360
<v Speaker 2>lhc large hadron collider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the ssc would have been both sooner</v>

3264
02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:07.350
<v Speaker 2>and better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have been higher energy</v>

3265
02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

3266
02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:10.070
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3267
02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.130
<v Speaker 2>well it started during the reagan</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and then clinton let it</v>

3268
02:29:13.131 --> 02:29:15.950
<v Speaker 2>be killed by congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3269
02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.440
<v Speaker 2>so Jeffrey West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a particle physics at the time</v>

3270
02:29:18.441 --> 02:29:20.470
<v Speaker 2>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my life's work.</v>

3271
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping for this to come online and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to see what,</v>

3272
02:29:23.140 --> 02:29:25.730
<v Speaker 2>what else can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

3273
02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:30.760
<v Speaker 2>he found that in biology there are what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is known as scaling laws.</v>

3274
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:34.310
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at different organisms</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mammals or whatever,</v>

3275
02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.650
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can plot different quantities like</v>

3276
02:29:36.651 --> 02:29:40.700
<v Speaker 2>their mass and their metabolism or their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifespan and things like that.</v>

3277
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:43.550
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that they are related</v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

3278
02:29:43.551 --> 02:29:44.384
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3279
02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:47.750
<v Speaker 2>if you know how heavy a mammal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how long it's going to live,</v>

3280
02:29:47.810 --> 02:29:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you can figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3281
02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.820
<v Speaker 2>and in fact it's related to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolism also.</v>

3282
02:29:52.821 --> 02:29:55.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's a wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically the bigger you are,</v>

3283
02:29:55.271 --> 02:29:57.440
<v Speaker 2>the longer you live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

3284
02:29:57.441 --> 02:30:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the bigger you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the slower your heartbeats and they</v>

3285
02:30:01.161 --> 02:30:05.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly cancel out so that every mammal</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives for about one and a half billion</v>

3286
02:30:05.421 --> 02:30:06.830
<v Speaker 2>heartbeats on.</v>

3287
02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I've read that and I relayed that to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that are runners and I was like,</v>

3288
02:30:12.671 --> 02:30:14.980
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think if you're an ultra</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon runner,</v>

3289
02:30:14.981 --> 02:30:16.450
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend cameron hanes,</v>

3290
02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:21.460
<v Speaker 3>he runs these 240 mile runs this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just did that in death valleY and the</v>

3291
02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:25.060
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I keep saying that ass,</v>

3292
02:30:25.061 --> 02:30:27.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Water.</v>

3293
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty five mileS.</v>

3294
02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:34.210
<v Speaker 3>These are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta think like exertion over</v>

3295
02:30:34.211 --> 02:30:36.070
<v Speaker 3>long periods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell them you're juicing up your</v>

3296
02:30:36.071 --> 02:30:38.110
<v Speaker 3>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get a finite number,</v>

3297
02:30:38.111 --> 02:30:39.760
<v Speaker 3>a fixed number of heartbeats to begin</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3298
02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:43.540
<v Speaker 3>but you know what they do do though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lowers their resting heart rate,</v>

3299
02:30:43.541 --> 02:30:44.890
<v Speaker 3>which is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3300
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:47.190
<v Speaker 3>So all this extreme exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3301
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:51.580
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting heartbeats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also your heartbeat is probably like</v>

3302
02:30:51.581 --> 02:30:54.460
<v Speaker 3>78.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas there's this 34,</v>

3303
02:30:54.730 --> 02:30:58.240
<v Speaker 3>now they're winning overall it totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>compensates weird,</v>

3304
02:30:58.241 --> 02:31:01.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird sort of intuitive thing.</v>

3305
02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:02.070
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

3306
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:04.650
<v Speaker 2>100 billion and a half is just an</v>
<v Speaker 2>average.</v>

3307
02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:07.340
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Jeffrey West and his collaborator.</v>

3308
02:31:07.341 --> 02:31:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that you know,</v>

3309
02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:13.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't make an animal that's twice as</v>
<v Speaker 2>big and lives the same blank.</v>

3310
02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3311
02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

3312
02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:19.050
<v Speaker 2>So they actually came up with a theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the fact that our bodies are</v>

3313
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.160
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our circulatory system or respiratory</v>

3314
02:31:23.161 --> 02:31:24.330
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our nervous system,</v>

3315
02:31:24.331 --> 02:31:25.950
<v Speaker 2>and they all have the same structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trees,</v>

3316
02:31:25.951 --> 02:31:28.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fractals and,</v>

3317
02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:31.170
<v Speaker 2>and they were able to show that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if our,</v>

3318
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:36.171
<v Speaker 2>if the resources that our biology uses</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel through these fractal networks in</v>

3319
02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:38.810
<v Speaker 2>a three dimensional space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3320
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:42.450
<v Speaker 2>The weird three dimensional beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get these scaling laws,</v>

3321
02:31:42.451 --> 02:31:46.950
<v Speaker 2>you get the this universal behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fits the data and now you know,</v>

3322
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you can extend it to the behavior of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like cities and corporations and</v>

3323
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:52.794
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3324
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So when you get people in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk faster,</v>

3325
02:31:57.300 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people in little small towns mosey</v>

3326
02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:02.370
<v Speaker 2>down the street and everyone in the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>city walks faster.</v>

3327
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3328
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:06.780
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

3329
02:32:06.850 --> 02:32:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would not be surprised to learn that</v>

3330
02:32:08.731 --> 02:32:11.460
<v Speaker 2>there are more patents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3331
02:32:11.490 --> 02:32:13.860
<v Speaker 2>that are generated in a big city than</v>
<v Speaker 2>this small town.</v>

3332
02:32:13.861 --> 02:32:17.400
<v Speaker 2>But there are even more patents per</v>
<v Speaker 2>person in a big city.</v>

3333
02:32:17.730 --> 02:32:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Like living in that dense environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes the rate of innovation and</v>

3334
02:32:22.351 --> 02:32:25.890
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're studying how we can try to</v>

3335
02:32:25.891 --> 02:32:30.450
<v Speaker 2>extract these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not quite as precise as particle</v>

3336
02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:32.940
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still very general robust</v>

3337
02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>relationships between these large</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and learn from that,</v>

3338
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:40.740
<v Speaker 2>how to make things more sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more creative,</v>

3339
02:32:40.741 --> 02:32:43.530
<v Speaker 2>more innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more livable and things like that.</v>

3340
02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think all this stuff is very fast.</v>

3341
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:50.400
<v Speaker 3>They've actually done studies where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've put cameras up on streets and</v>

3342
02:32:50.401 --> 02:32:54.390
<v Speaker 3>they watch people walk by and the amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of footsteps they take per minute,</v>

3343
02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:59.600
<v Speaker 3>they can accurately depict or they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurately predict how many people live</v>

3344
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:02.250
<v Speaker 3>in that city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

3345
02:33:02.251 --> 02:33:03.630
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3346
02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Just based on how and also how fast you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

3347
02:33:06.970 --> 02:33:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fast you talk.</v>

3348
02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3349
02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:13.630
<v Speaker 2>how fast the line moves in the dmv</v>
<v Speaker 2>office in,</v>

3350
02:33:13.690 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it's dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure but,</v>

3351
02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:19.000
<v Speaker 2>but Jeffrey West has this picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dublin.</v>

3352
02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:22.480
<v Speaker 2>There's this tourist area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's both a big city where a lot</v>

3353
02:33:22.481 --> 02:33:24.940
<v Speaker 2>of people live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a famous tourist</v>

3354
02:33:24.941 --> 02:33:27.190
<v Speaker 2>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're foreigners come in and wander</v>

3355
02:33:27.191 --> 02:33:28.024
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3356
02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:31.330
<v Speaker 2>And the locals who live in a big city</v>
<v Speaker 2>and want to get where they want to go</v>

3357
02:33:31.331 --> 02:33:34.270
<v Speaker 2>became so frustrated with all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>moseying tourists.</v>

3358
02:33:34.450 --> 02:33:38.010
<v Speaker 2>They literally made walking lanes for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the locals where you have to walk</v>

3359
02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:38.831
<v Speaker 3>faxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3360
02:33:38.831 --> 02:33:41.590
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to meander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

3361
02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:43.570
<v Speaker 3>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3362
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for doing this.</v>

3363
02:33:46.930 --> 02:33:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for being you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for this podcast.</v>

3364
02:33:49.991 --> 02:33:53.590
<v Speaker 3>You're putting out the books you write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so important for people like me to</v>

3365
02:33:53.591 --> 02:33:56.320
<v Speaker 3>have someone like you that can sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate a lot of these things.</v>

3366
02:33:56.321 --> 02:33:56.780
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3367
02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:58.030
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really appreciate your time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My pleasure and mindscape podcast.</v>

3370
02:34:04.210 --> 02:34:05.920
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's available now.</v>
