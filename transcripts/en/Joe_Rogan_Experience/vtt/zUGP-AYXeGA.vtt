14
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>saxophone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you could have met Dolly.</v>

31
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any old title and that's not a sign of</v>

32
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>prosperity or success or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

33
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that happened back on clerks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

34
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>But those days when Dolly Parton was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>

35
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>there was only like three channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>She fills arenas like it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive.</v>

37
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And just watching somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw when I went up to Vancouver to</v>

39
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>shoot an episode of the Flash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and I was like,</v>

40
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a part of me,</v>

41
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big country guy,</v>

42
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but my old man loved country and Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we came from New Jersey and</v>

43
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>we weren't even from like Southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jersey.</v>

44
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>We're from Central Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved country,</v>

45
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>West country and western.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated it growing up.</v>

46
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's now dead for like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 years.</v>

47
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And naturally the older one gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that music,</v>

48
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>it takes you not to the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right back to your childhood.</v>

49
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I've never been a country</v>

50
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find more country leaking into my life</v>

51
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and it has everything to do with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>father or something like that.</v>

52
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So I went to see the show and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I might as well taking my dad with</v>

53
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been dead so long.</v>

54
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>But like that was his dream show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he loved Dolly parties,</v>

55
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>big country music fan generally love</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dolly Parton.</v>

56
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>So I went to see the show the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>

57
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

58
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I was blown away by her</v>
<v Speaker 1>showmanship,</v>

59
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>a storyteller as well.</v>

60
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't just sit there and play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music between songs.</v>

61
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>She'll sit there and tell you a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>about growing up in the rocky mountains.</v>

62
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking funny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know she's got like patterns she's</v>

63
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>probably been doing for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she talks about.</v>

64
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a little girl,</v>

65
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>like we went into town and they grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking poor and she's one of 13</v>

<v Speaker 1>children or something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

67

<v Speaker 1>that's why she's got the look.</v>

76
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.163

<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

77
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it cost a lot of money to look this</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she was going for.</v>

96
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It was awkward dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a moment where they were the</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody's mother is very singular</v>

102
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mom had this thing I was trying to</v>

103
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:11.921
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

104
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>when did this person die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were talking about Barbara.</v>

105
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did aunt Barbara di and my mom's</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

107
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had this thing when we were</v>

108
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she get a calendar from church and</v>

109
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't write on it your birthday</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a relative's birthday.</v>

110
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>She'd write the day that they died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like this day was the day uncle Andy</v>

111
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>die this day and Connie died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my mom keeps all that information.</v>

112
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

113
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>She comes out with a box of like funeral</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass cards.</v>

114
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Like when somebody dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a funeral,</v>

115
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a little trading card that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of St John.</v>

116
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>The bag has a person's name and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were born,</v>

117
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>when they were dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom has like a collection,</v>

118
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the way you would collect baseball cards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit and we spread them all out on</v>

119
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>the table is 12 significant deaths in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our family.</v>

120
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>She had lots more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ones that would matter to both</v>

121
00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:00.871
<v Speaker 1>me and her in our immediate zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a family and between 12 deaths I was</v>

122
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>able to quiz my mother like who died in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1980 and she was like,</v>

123
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.274
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was grandpa Smith.</v>

124
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Like she is my mom's obsessed with death</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in a like death is metal.</v>

125
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>When she was a child in Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to explain hell her,</v>

126
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you do in Catholic school,</v>

127
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>and she was fucking far too young to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea.</v>

128
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>So death has been her obsession her</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

129
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Staving it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping it from taking not just her but</v>

130
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.251
<v Speaker 1>her family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>she lost her husband to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all.</v>

132
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Death is just a natural part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

133
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>My mom finds it like she's terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I as a,</v>

134
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>as a creative person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder if you feel the same way</v>

135
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and I fancy myself a creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like you,</v>

136
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>not very creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fancy myself a creative person.</v>

137
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>No caveats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death to me is not scary as much as like</v>

138
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>a repugnant idea where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

139
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Stop all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just getting the hang of it.</v>

140
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just learning like I got so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>more jokes to tell and Shit like that.</v>

141
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Like death to people who make stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and that's why you might be the</v>

142
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>exception because you deal with death on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis.</v>

143
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Like with hunting and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just something that probably</v>

144
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>enters your purview farm with a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is like one of those things,</v>

145
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you like wow,</v>

146
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't really thought about that too</v>
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>

147
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>but she's thinks about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often when I think of death I'm</v>

148
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>irritated by it because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfair.</v>

149
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

150
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>But I imagine if I was by my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother,</v>

151
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother lost her sight 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 years before she died and I loved</v>

152
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just play cards with her and shit like</v>

153
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

154
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And then when she lost her sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did.</v>

155
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>She was no longer interested in living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she would sit around and be like,</v>

156
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>how are you gram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go visit her,</v>

157
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>she'd be sitting in the dark and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to the radio,</v>

158
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe no longer crocheting like she used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

159
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>We used to play cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do any of that shit.</v>

160
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>So she just sat there and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

161
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>And she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I asked him to take me and he said</v>

162
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>he didn't answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still not today.</v>

163
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Graham.</v>

164
00:06:55.971 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>She's like Jesus every day I pray that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finally take me and I'm still here.</v>

165
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And she grew slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew to be bitter about life and shit.</v>

166
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from where I sit right now,</v>

167
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never want this party to an oh shit.</v>

168
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>But I guess there could be a time in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life where you know,</v>

169
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>everyone you know and love is past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get to a place where you're</v>

170
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

171
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>

172
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:23.891
<v Speaker 1>Like who was it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singer that that just passed a law</v>

173
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>was the guy that sang Hallelujah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Cohen,</v>

174
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Cohen didn't interview like</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he passed like five months,</v>

175
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 40 past where he was like,</v>

176
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready for death.</v>

177
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty much done everything I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do and I'm,</v>

178
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he went fairly short there.</v>

179
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandma didn't Ms. Young on for a while</v>

180
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>but wanted to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm never that person.</v>
