<v Speaker 1>You guys still fucking rock hard,</v>

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't.</v>

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I love aerosmith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a huge aerosmith fan when I was</v>

11
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line they became</v>

12
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>a ballot van somewhere along the line I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing movies for music,</v>

13
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>for mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

14
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>for movies that appeal to like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent teenage girls.</v>

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something happened.</v>

16
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

18
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And then other people start writing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs.</v>

19
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's I think the,</v>

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate kind of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 2>not given up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've,</v>

22
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've lost your way.</v>

23
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to talk to you about like </v>

24
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a transition that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people make and either they </v>

25
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>make it or they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

26
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transition is to go from being </v>

27
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>hungry and filled with all this anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>to being like stupid,</v>

28
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>wealthy and famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still keeping your art relevant.</v>

29
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you do that?</v>

30
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're super competitive.</v>

31
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.891
<v Speaker 2>People were really perfectionists and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate to let each other down.</v>

32
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

33
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 2>there's always a better riff coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a better album.</v>

34
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's the never satisfied part </v>

35
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>to us that will keep us going til we </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

36
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the ultimate lyric that's</v>

37
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>going to connect to everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world or something.</v>

38
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>There is always a better something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't got yet.</v>

39
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So is that mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you.</v>

40
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the beginning you just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it right?</v>

41
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a successful band?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to make it,</v>

42
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're filled with adjuncts,</v>

43
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>but your music as a same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity to it.</v>

44
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Like today in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in there,</v>

45
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't listened to your new album or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

46
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I fucking cranked it up to nine and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

47
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I turned it on and right from the </v>

48
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 1>jump I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

49
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard rock album that just gets </v>

50
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you pumped up and you guys are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent a plus.</v>

51
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Succeeded with this one.</v>

52
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Awesome to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

53
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>that's why we do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We write music,</v>

54
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>we write music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we record music that we want to hear </v>

55
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 2>because we're not hearing it out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

56
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it's been since day one.</v>

57
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>as you were were pretty honest in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>music too.</v>

59
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So I love the fact that from album one </v>
<v Speaker 2>to here we're doing it our way and we're</v>

60
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:48.501
<v Speaker 2>writing songs for ourselves and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an honesty that has to be in it </v>

61
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>or people</v>

62
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can see that shit on.</v>

63
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like little animals.</v>

64
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>They smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

65
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

66
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they smell,</v>

67
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>they smell it the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:07.711
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's refreshing to see a band that's </v>

69
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 2>been at it for a long time that's super </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

70
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>That still goes after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.691
<v Speaker 2>The thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that bugs me a lot is when </v>

72
00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:15.691
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that you're now that you're sober or</v>

74
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:22.891
<v Speaker 2>now that you're matured now all this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've worked out all your inner demons </v>

75
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:28.351
<v Speaker 2>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your music's going to be all soft </v>

76
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>and flowery and I tell Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

77
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>if I could exercise all those demons I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have and it,</v>

78
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something you,</v>

79
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>you embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of me and I get to celebrate</v>

80
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>it in my music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to communicate it.</v>

81
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.991
<v Speaker 2>I get to use it as a therapy to help my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own insanity and other people do too.</v>

82
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So when you get those like minded people</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a place and play live music </v>

83
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 2>does something to people like you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>

84
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I get to watch people at our shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform from God.</v>

85
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I just took my tie off or I still have </v>
<v Speaker 2>my frigging briefcase,</v>

86
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like handcuffed to me.</v>

87
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I want out of this and I get to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose and I get to see these people </v>

88
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>transform and s and watch music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do stuff to them.</v>

89
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforms the right word,</v>

90
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does,</v>

91
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

92
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an element of music that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get discussed that it does have </v>

93
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.241
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an effect on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's like when you hear a good </v>

94
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>song and you're in your Cannula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a drug.</v>

95
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

96
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a shot of this caveman nitrile is</v>

97
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>more powerful than that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's instantaneous,</v>

98
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of seating tickets.</v>

99
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the best place like for Lars</v>

100
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and I to listen to the music when we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it together,</v>

101
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it make the car test?</v>

102
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you're yourself in your </v>

103
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if no one else is in there,</v>

104
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

105
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 2>you get to celebrate and listen and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go frigging nuts in your car.</v>

106
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car test,</v>

107
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be where most people </v>

108
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:13.591
<v Speaker 2>listened to most of their music these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days with all the commuting people do.</v>

109
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Especially here in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous place as where you </v>

110
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 2>live in these totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We save people from road rage,</v>

111
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>the kids just headbang people ramping it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

112
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not too much shooting people in </v>

113
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.251
<v Speaker 2>cars anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going on for awhile in the </v>

114
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:32.251
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as Trinity.</v>

115
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>What do you live these days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Vail,</v>

116
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

117
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda cool.</v>

118
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Is very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quiet.</v>

119
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>No frigging traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

120
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 2>and especially now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super quiet snow.</v>

121
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>A snow dose does something to calm you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a little bit.</v>

122
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was a kid in Boston,</v>

123
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 2>there was those days when it would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow hard.</v>

124
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 2>He'd go outside and you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet like it.</v>

125
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Never heard it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

126
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything filtered by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>

127
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

128
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

129
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lone wolf part of me that I,</v>

130
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can relate to,</v>

131
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but I like being by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also like,</v>

132
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I need people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to connect with as well.</v>

133
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.390
<v Speaker 2>But when I get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in Vail,</v>

135
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>moving from California to Colorado was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

136
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.800
<v Speaker 2>was a great thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really ugh.</v>

137
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I feel a part of nature there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

138
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 2>and you don't want to be inside there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about it.</v>

139
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 2>You just want to be outside all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

140
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.450
<v Speaker 2>What's so beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Colorado this weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is something about Colorado.</v>

144
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Those mountains are just the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural artwork like you could ever look</v>

145
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.350

<v Speaker 2>We get to look at the Gore range right </v>

147
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:52.601
<v Speaker 2>out our mountain and I've drank plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>of coors lights in my life and that's </v>

148
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 2>the one on the can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of great snowmobiling,</v>

152
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.130

<v Speaker 2>paddleboard and you name it.</v>

153
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a fourteener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 14,000</v>

154
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete peaks.</v>

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,000</v>

156
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who are in the climate,</v>

157
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>those crazy peaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Or hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>what made you move out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

160
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you go there and visit first or just</v>

161
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 2>decided you needed a separate from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hive and.</v>

162
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:28.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a multitude of things </v>

163
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 2>that made it happen.</v>

164
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>My wife grew up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was born in Argentina,</v>

165
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 2>they moved to Vail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went to elementary school there,</v>

166
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going to Tahoe a lot to do </v>

167
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.590
<v Speaker 2>skiing and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

168
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you gotta we gotta go to Vale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

169
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>this is not snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will go to Vail and feel snow.</v>

170
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 2>And we went there a few times and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved it.</v>

171
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not a huge skier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can ski and have fun doing it.</v>

172
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 2>My kids love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and so that my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife turns into a kid when we go </v>

174
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I kind of like,</v>

175
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 2>she can be a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 2>a little too on point and a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

179
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

180
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 2>she loosens up and she becomes young </v>
<v Speaker 2>again there.</v>

181
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's that kind of got sick of the </v>

182
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 2>bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attitudes of people.</v>

183
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>They're a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

184
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about how diverse they are and</v>

185
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 2>things like that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine if you're diverse like them,</v>

186
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

187
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up with a deer on the bumper </v>

188
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fly in Marin county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

189
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

190
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.110
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my form of eating organic doesn't vibe </v>

191
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.110
<v Speaker 2>with theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

192
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have issues with that?</v>

193
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Like with the people you lived with up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Marin county with hunting?</v>

194
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Or was it just something you felt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

195
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something I felt,</v>

196
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably made it up in my head a </v>

197
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.180
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

198
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>because I'm pretty good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty creative and I can start fights </v>

199
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>with myself in my head all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people get.</v>

200
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

201
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 2>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just a,</v>

202
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt that there was an elitist </v>

203
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.231
<v Speaker 2>attitude there that if you weren't there</v>
<v Speaker 2>way politically their way,</v>

204
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>environmentally all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

206
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were looked down upon.</v>

207
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I think in Colorado everyone is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>

208
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>People are not playing some game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not posturing,</v>

209
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very into,</v>

210
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like doing that?</v>

211
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that go?</v>

212
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 2>How you doing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

213
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

214
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 2>they're less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're less obsessed with stopping what</v>

215
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:54.651
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and more enjoying what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

216
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

217
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the bay area,</v>

218
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but I've always felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you nailed it.</v>

219
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.610
<v Speaker 1>The Bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love diversity as long as you're </v>

220
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.610
<v Speaker 1>diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they're diverse.</v>

221
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.470
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so tech oriented,</v>

222
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it's so absorbed with one aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

223
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>technology and cell phones and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and electric cars and it's so </v>

224
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>locked into that one sort of mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being that I think a guy like you goes </v>

225
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>out there and shoot an elk or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

226
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a little creepy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

227
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

228
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I just think I feel more at home in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>midwest or the mountains or something.</v>

229
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the ocean and I love the bay </v>

230
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:39.700
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love what it's got to offer,</v>

231
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an attitude that it was,</v>

232
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

233
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.990
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't healthy for me starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>

234
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:52.991
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just fighting all the time and I </v>

235
00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:52.991
<v Speaker 2>just had to</v>

236
00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 1>get out of my own head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Colorado does it for me.</v>

237
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 1>You were doing that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunt that,</v>

238
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show that,</v>

239
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>what is it on history channel or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that where it was all </v>

240
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 1>about a grizzly bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were doing the narration for that.</v>

241
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

242
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw this crazy blow back because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where there was people were they </v>

243
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.210
<v Speaker 1>wanted a boycott at music festival that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys were on and,</v>

244
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>and there was photos of another guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't you or they're getting circled </v>

245
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.530
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saying it was you.</v>

246
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 1>They killed a grizzly bear and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

247
00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>we have to ban this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is heartless.</v>

248
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was your reaction to all that?</v>

249
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda just took it as,</v>

250
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:36.141
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it's been for me in the bay </v>

251
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:36.141
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

252
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand it and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like with anything,</v>

253
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they understand that </v>

254
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>someone can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is passionate about something else,</v>

255
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as passionate as they are about what </v>

256
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:53.720
<v Speaker 2>they are passionate about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

257
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you're as a passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

258
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 2>there's someone who's the opposite and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

259
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 2>You can get along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can talk about it.</v>

260
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 2>No one's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's wrong.</v>

261
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 2>This is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to live in it this way.</v>

262
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 2>You like living your life that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally get it,</v>

263
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but we can coexist in this and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really be diverse,</v>

264
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me going out,</v>

265
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 2>whether it's planning my own vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having my own beehives,</v>

266
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 2>getting our own honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

267
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 2>harvesting my own meat on the ranch.</v>

268
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love sustaining my family with as </v>

269
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 2>organic as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

270
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

271
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect people that don't want the </v>

272
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:47.650
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want all that scene.</v>

273
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 2>They would rather see their meat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

274
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 2>show up in a nice cellophane package and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's handed to them.</v>

275
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to know how it got </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

276
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I I respect that my kids are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to see it going on,</v>

277
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 2>but I want to be as close to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be as part of it as possible.</v>

278
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to be part of every bit of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect it.</v>

279
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that sentiment and I always found </v>

280
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it strange how many people get upset at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

281
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:21.361
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile they're eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the San Francisco is filled with </v>

282
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 1>restaurants that are serving meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>

283
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.060
<v Speaker 1>every single store you pass by has meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it and to focus on you for going out </v>

284
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 1>and hunting is always a little weird.</v>

285
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm more old school.</v>

286
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>

287
00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:38.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the bay area prides itself and </v>

288
00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad there is a place that prides </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself on being progressive,</v>

289
00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 2>very moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

290
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:45.870
<v Speaker 2>we're creating the future here and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love the convenience and stuff of that,</v>

291
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a part of me that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe is like frontier style.</v>

292
00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I just love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather be simple.</v>

293
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>

294
00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also probably you're </v>

295
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.001
<v Speaker 1>performing in front of fucking hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of people all the time and </v>

296
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:02.460
<v Speaker 1>he just like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a balance.</v>

297
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need some sort of an opposite end of</v>

298
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:06.570
<v Speaker 1>the scale just to weigh things out.</v>

299
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Very true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very true.</v>

300
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.610
<v Speaker 2>what about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want me time,</v>

302
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill time,</v>

303
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.750
<v Speaker 2>quit pulling me all these different ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

304
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not complaining.</v>

305
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:20.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what I choose to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also choose this too.</v>

306
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where a vail completely makes </v>

307
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.790
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long have you been raising bees?</v>

308
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Probably only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe four years.</v>

309
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.350
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get started in that?</v>

310
00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:34.380
<v Speaker 2>How do you start raising bees?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start with one.</v>

311
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Speaker 2>We'll actually start with to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

312
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like rabbits,</v>

313
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 2>but they do produce quite quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

314
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad raised bees,</v>

315
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

316
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.830
<v Speaker 2>we always saw boxes out in the corner of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house.</v>

317
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 2>We grew up in la here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 2>the weather's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of activity.</v>

319
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the bummer about being in Vale </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

320
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of action going on.</v>

321
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.460
<v Speaker 2>It's too high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too cold and you know,</v>

322
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>certain vegetables grow there but not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

323
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in California,</v>

324
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 2>the ranch love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

325
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I got to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who in his backyard,</v>

326
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:18.251
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably had six hives and he had </v>

327
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 2>this one really intense kind of rogue </v>
<v Speaker 2>hive where maybe the queen had some kind</v>

328
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:25.691
<v Speaker 2>of strain of a africanized or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and her wife could not,</v>

329
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 2>his wife could not go out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard without being attacked,</v>

330
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>

331
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I go put my bees on your property so</v>

332
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 2>they can cycle this queen out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 2>they got some breeding in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just off Jesus Christ.</v>

334
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brought it out to the ranch,</v>

335
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 2>he pinched the B and then a pinch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The queen pinched it.</v>

336
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.140
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean killed it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she's crying.</v>

337
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice euphemism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to shoot it or nothing,</v>

338
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold still.</v>

339
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 2>So he just grabbed the queen and killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

340
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Well has pinched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could because she was reproducing.</v>

341
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lay a million eggs in their lives.</v>

342
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:05.680
<v Speaker 2>It's insane that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

343
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically,</v>

344
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:11.951
<v Speaker 2>I could sit here and talk a whole hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>about bees because they're so </v>

345
00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:11.951
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

346
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the listener,</v>

347
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not scaring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

348
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>they listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll listen.</v>

349
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting stuff.</v>

350
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.620
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it put a new queen in there and </v>

351
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cycled through all of the other bs.</v>

352
00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only live a month.</v>

353
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.640
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a normal reaction when people go </v>

354
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 2>in the yard would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just disinterest.</v>

355
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.310
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't care about you as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not interrupting the hive.</v>

356
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your wife would go out there and </v>

357
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:39.370
<v Speaker 2>they would just get crazy.</v>

358
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

359
00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

360
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.670
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was my friend's wife.</v>

361
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.210
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

362
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

363
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

364
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of used to it and she was not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was out to go swimming or go out </v>

365
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 2>there and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would get crazy with him,</v>

366
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't bother me.</v>

367
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 2>But she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this queen.</v>

368
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this hive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

369
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>

370
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 2>And there's certain things if we're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

371
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 2>they all attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You almost think you're a bear.</v>

372
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like just eaten banana's,</v>

374
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.530
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

375
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a smell or a something in it that is </v>

376
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>similar to their attack pheromone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they set off.</v>

377
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 2>So there's a few things I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>

378
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Tony and bananas and don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't wear black.</v>

379
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you gotta do.</v>

380
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 2>But I learned this stuff being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bee club.</v>

381
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

382
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

383
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

384
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 2>in the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

385
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 2>We'd meet down at the American Legion </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hall and have a monthly meeting.</v>

386
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>One of those dorks like me and my buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

387
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.660
<v Speaker 2>we would just sit there and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh about him.</v>

388
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're sitting,</v>

389
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.960
<v Speaker 2>we're here to learn some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were people up there,</v>

390
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We inseminated the queen with this and </v>

391
00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're counting bs,</v>

392
00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put little numbers on every B and </v>

393
00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 2>we've caught their flight pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many were reproducing this.</v>

394
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

395
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a,</v>

396
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

397
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

398
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.970
<v Speaker 2>they're doing research on how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the be stronger because the bees are </v>

399
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 2>going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

400
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

401
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 2>this might this little a Varroa mite </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's killing a lot of them too,</v>

402
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>along with the pesticides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>herbicides,</v>

403
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

404
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are so into it and we're </v>

405
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 2>just gonna sit in there going home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

406
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 2>what have we gotten ourselves into?</v>

407
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.050
<v Speaker 2>But it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>it's funny in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm glad that it's happening.</v>

409
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

410
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it at the end of the season,</v>

411
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:45.561
<v Speaker 2>you get like 500 pounds of honey and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're handing them out to your friends </v>

412
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five hundred pounds of honey.</v>

413
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 2>And we're bottling it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My kids are filtering it,</v>

415
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>we're bottling it up and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

416
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just straight from the hive into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle.</v>

417
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you've filtered it.</v>

418
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And it really helps with allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps with,</v>

419
00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:07.480
<v Speaker 2>the whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the pollens and the,</v>

421
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.560
<v Speaker 2>and the nectar is from the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you take that in and it helps </v>

422
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 2>build your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

423
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've experienced that person.</v>

424
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think being stung by bees helps </v>

425
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 2>you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps with,</v>

426
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 2>with something getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your immune system built up to.</v>

427
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be really good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis.</v>

428
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.060
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take people like literally take </v>

429
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.060
<v Speaker 2>bees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>

430
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 2>that have serious arthritis in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and they sting their hands with it</v>

431
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 2>on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

432
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some people that do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their lips here in la.</v>

433
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you need people that are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

434
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:45.651
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep into the pe world because you're </v>

435
00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:45.651
<v Speaker 2>not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it,</v>

436
00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:48.711
<v Speaker 2>but if someone's just so far gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're measuring all their bs and </v>

437
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 2>monitoring their flight patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>checking their DNA.</v>

438
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fascinated that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear differentiation between a normal b</v>

439
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:02.030
<v Speaker 2>and the way these bees were behaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could tell that the queen was </v>

440
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 2>kind of a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Italia,</v>

441
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 2>those freak beast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Africanized or whatever.</v>

442
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a Zombie bee and we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get into that too,</v>

443
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

444
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.850
<v Speaker 2>they are aggressive and an aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like any society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do well,</v>

446
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get most,</v>

447
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.190
<v Speaker 2>they produce a lot of honey and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

448
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very prolific in what they do,</v>

449
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I've had killer bee honey.</v>

451
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.660
<v Speaker 2>They make killer bee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what sounded good on it.</v>

452
00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:35.661
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he knows any better if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a killer bee honey better than </v>

453
00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 2>regular honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just pretty dope to have killer bee </v>

454
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 2>honey around your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's from their brains.</v>

469
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Brain juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

470
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it come out?</v>

471
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it come out of a hole somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

472
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have to scoop it out of their </v>

473
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking heads?</v>

474
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it that close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they injected into the,</v>

475
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 2>injected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the queen cell or there's a cell </v>

476
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that they make when a new queen is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>made to all the bees that are flying </v>

477
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 2>around that you see out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 2>they're all females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge.</v>

479
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 2>It's all female society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the drones that are in there,</v>

480
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 2>which were the males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there just to reproduce and then</v>

481
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 2>they get kicked out in the wintertime </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't all die.</v>

482
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

483
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

484
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 2>It's hard outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

485
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Brutal for us men in the B world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they all die,</v>

486
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 2>how do they continue to reproduce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

487
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:51.950
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the couple stay on.</v>

488
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

489
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 2>the queen makes more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

490
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 2>So those guys are just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Queen makes more on the new ones.</v>

491
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Takeover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new boys.</v>

492
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

493
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.380
<v Speaker 2>and they're just doing work.</v>

494
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 2>They're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just fertilizing.</v>

495
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just there to fuck.</v>

496
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody else doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real word fuck and go die.</v>

497
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a brutal world.</v>

498
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what a fucking crazy world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the queen goes around the hive </v>

499
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.020
<v Speaker 2>and finds the females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

500
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 2>other potential queens and stabs them </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're in the hive.</v>

501
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

502
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Well they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all females.</v>

503
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 2>All females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Septa for those drones.</v>

504
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's,</v>

505
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 2>if they're making a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 2>she knows she's going to die or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of pissed off with her.</v>

507
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:39.850
<v Speaker 2>She's not reproducing as much as she </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

508
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 2>She will take off with half the hive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you see a swarm.</v>

509
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.380
<v Speaker 2>So she'll go and form a new hive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then these ones have a little queen cell</v>

510
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 2>that they've laid eggs and start to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new queen.</v>

511
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 2>So that's how they reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if there's three or four queen cells</v>

512
00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first queen that's born,</v>

513
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.470
<v Speaker 2>she comes out and she kills all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other Queens so she can rule game of </v>

514
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 2>thrones type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

515
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to get bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell them from right now looking </v>

516
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking at websites in my hand.</v>

517
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm like trying to find out where to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bees.</v>

518
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like an amazing way to get </v>

519
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.150
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

520
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it just sounds like a really cool thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do to taste so good.</v>

521
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

523
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>we have a place in Hawaii so we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiian flavored Hawaiian flavored.</v>

524
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Well there's stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

526
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:36.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the nectar and pollen from over </v>

527
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:36.961
<v Speaker 2>there and had Hawaii's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

528
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting honey year round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What island and Maui.</v>

529
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Maui.</v>

530
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

531
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>so when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know</v>

532
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 3>that a b is Africanized?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that was the big thing that </v>

533
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.311
<v Speaker 3>everybody was worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember it was like the early </v>

534
00:23:54.311 --> 00:23:54.311
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>

535
00:23:54.311 --> 00:23:58.110
<v Speaker 3>can we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found an African killer bee and no next </v>

536
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.110
<v Speaker 3>echo or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was like,</v>

537
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.950
<v Speaker 3>it's coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna,</v>

538
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna Swarm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They going to take over the country.</v>

539
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 3>And inside of a few years there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big hysteria about that,</v>

540
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

541
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are,</v>

542
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:10.570
<v Speaker 3>there are states where there are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevalent than others and they're just </v>

543
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.310
<v Speaker 3>more aggressive or more aggressive in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

544
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

545
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very protective.</v>

546
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.910
<v Speaker 3>So you'll get stung if you're messing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them to,</v>

547
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 3>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing so.</v>

548
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.420
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a big concern that they were </v>

549
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 3>going to take hold and that it was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be that these bees,</v>

550
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna come here and outbreed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regular bs and I hear laughing,</v>

551
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.830
<v Speaker 3>remember possible?</v>

552
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

553
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 3>There's some great movies about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

554
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the killer bees,</v>

555
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way to tell by looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

556
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

557
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm somewhat into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't,</v>

558
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 3>haven't investigated that part yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these bees that came over from the,</v>

559
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.160
<v Speaker 3>perhaps africanized bees that when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed the queen and then introduce </v>

560
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 3>those bees to the rest of the bs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody chill out.</v>

561
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just that one crazy bitch.</v>

562
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

563
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.370
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

564
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 3>she's laying the eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's passing on the whatever DNA.</v>

565
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are the,</v>

566
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

567
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the forage or bees,</v>

568
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:12.851
<v Speaker 3>the ones that you see out and about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only live a month so they will die </v>

569
00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long did she live?</v>

570
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 3>She can live between one to five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

571
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 3>What a bizarre culture stream.</v>

572
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool.</v>

573
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 3>And without them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

574
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.640
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

575
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orange almonds,</v>

576
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially here in California and the,</v>

577
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

578
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the center,</v>

579
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 3>a center of California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that farming.</v>

580
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 3>If there's no bs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no fruit.</v>

581
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a bizarre sort of symbiotic </v>

582
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 3>relationship that we have with some one </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird insect pollination.</v>

583
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would've thought that that would </v>

584
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 3>have been taken care of some other way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wouldn't be that a baby has to do</v>

585
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

586
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 3>there are others that do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What other butterflies?</v>

587
00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just honeybees,</v>

588
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably over 3000 different </v>

589
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.300
<v Speaker 3>kinds of bees there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have,</v>

590
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a hive society like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>honeybees do,</v>

591
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.870
<v Speaker 3>but all these other bees are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>loners.</v>

592
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in the ground or something and</v>

593
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:22.151
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get enough pollen for </v>

594
00:26:22.151 --> 00:26:25.001
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're kind of lone lone wolves out </v>

595
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:26.480
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the honeybees are the ones that have</v>

596
00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 3>more of a society.</v>

597
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I raised chickens and the chicken thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us happened.</v>

598
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 3>We just got a couple of chickens and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next thing you know,</v>

599
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:39.101
<v Speaker 3>we got this giant fucking chicken house </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 23 chickens and they're running </v>

600
00:26:39.101 --> 00:26:39.780
<v Speaker 3>around my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same way with the leg?</v>

601
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of like slowly step into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then get deeper and deeper?</v>

602
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just like getting your first </v>

603
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 3>tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

604
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

605
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want more.</v>

606
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

607
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:55.281
<v Speaker 3>you just start to appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when I come off tour it's like </v>

608
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:57.570
<v Speaker 3>my head is like ricocheting around in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there a,</v>

609
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.540
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goal.</v>

610
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 3>When I sit and watch the bees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just watch them go in and out,</v>

611
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 3>in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like this frigging landing strip</v>

612
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 3>that he come in and they look so busy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it relaxes me.</v>

613
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

614
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that busy,</v>

615
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 3>just cool.</v>

616
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Just chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

617
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:22.581
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you like a glass wall in any way </v>

618
00:27:22.581 --> 00:27:25.911
<v Speaker 3>where you can see into the hive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen those hives where they </v>

619
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:25.911
<v Speaker 3>make them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have it like that?</v>

620
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:26.520
<v Speaker 3>We can look in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

621
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I've got one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that's like a display one would bring</v>

623
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:35.391
<v Speaker 3>into schools and see I don't have one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those but I got a couple of different </v>

624
00:27:35.391 --> 00:27:37.640
<v Speaker 3>kinds of hives and it's fun to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

625
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:42.650
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have the frames that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>already kind of prebuilt and then they </v>

626
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:48.081
<v Speaker 3>just deposit their stuff in it or you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch them grow their own comb from </v>

627
00:27:48.081 --> 00:27:52.221
<v Speaker 3>nothing and it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get them to stay there </v>

628
00:27:52.221 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how does it work?</v>

629
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I see those boxes and I know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bees do have hives in those boxes,</v>

630
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 3>but how does it initially start?</v>

631
00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the queen.</v>

632
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Wherever the queen is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where they go.</v>

633
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 3>So she decides to be in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you get her to stay in that </v>

634
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 3>box?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

635
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 3>do you have a place for her to lay eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

636
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.510
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

637
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.040
<v Speaker 3>And she will stay and if she's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when they go off to to swarm to</v>

638
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:20.091
<v Speaker 3>go find a new hive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever seen a swarm up in a </v>

639
00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 3>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a giant,</v>

640
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.730
<v Speaker 3>like football size or even bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shape of just bs at Queen is right in </v>

641
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 3>the middle and they're all just around </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and then they send off the scouts to</v>

642
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 3>find a new spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come back say,</v>

643
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:39.381
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over here to do the little wiggle </v>

644
00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:39.381
<v Speaker 3>dance and that shows them how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

645
00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:43.641
<v Speaker 3>And they all go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had an incident once on fear factor </v>

646
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:43.641
<v Speaker 3>where we covered these people with bs.</v>

647
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:48.060
<v Speaker 3>There was like a beekeeper there and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had his hives and a local hive came over</v>

648
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240
<v Speaker 3>and a group of bees came over and met </v>
<v Speaker 3>with these bees and we had a clear the </v>

649
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.120
<v Speaker 3>area out and they had to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

650
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Like literally what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were in the air just floating </v>

651
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.441
<v Speaker 3>around and then they worked it out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the rbs came back and they went </v>

652
00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 3>back to the hive and the bees went about</v>
<v Speaker 3>their business.</v>

653
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 3>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck's going on?</v>

654
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You guys moving in here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing?</v>

655
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Territorial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow or another,</v>

656
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 3>they worked it out though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no death,</v>

657
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't be fucking braveheart war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

658
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 3>they figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had a good negotiator.</v>

659
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they communicate with any living</v>

660
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 3>these in pheromones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how are they?</v>

661
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Smells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smells and dances.</v>

662
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Dances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

663
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Some B will find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

664
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.870
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found like a garden somewhere and </v>

665
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>they'll come back and they'll see them </v>
<v Speaker 3>do the little wiggle thing.</v>

666
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:42.081
<v Speaker 3>It's like how many wiggles this way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they turned left and then turn </v>

667
00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:42.081
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

668
00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:42.081
<v Speaker 3>that's like</v>

669
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 2>a half a mile this way and then that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

670
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And then they all learn it and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for,</v>

671
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found some water,</v>

672
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 2>here's a place to go.</v>

673
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So they literally can tell them where </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is.</v>

674
00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:52.520
<v Speaker 1>But the movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

676
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a body language pretty much.</v>

677
00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And they all know it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instinctively.</v>

678
00:30:01.251 --> 00:30:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

679
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bizarre.</v>

680
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot to learn about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

681
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.030
<v Speaker 1>That's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that they can tell each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other where something is just by </v>

683
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.890
<v Speaker 1>wiggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have like this means a mile.</v>

684
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That means go left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

685
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:19.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get.</v>

686
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get deep and bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

687
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

688
00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

689
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's probably a feel of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

690
00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.080
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

691
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole society right here in my</v>

692
00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Speaker 2>yard and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm overseeing it,</v>

693
00:30:34.611 --> 00:30:36.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a sense of importance.</v>

694
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

695
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I lay off of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people that are </v>

696
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.930
<v Speaker 2>checking them all the time and this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and oh,</v>

697
00:30:44.931 --> 00:30:49.931
<v Speaker 2>you got to put the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the certain pads in there to kill the </v>

698
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Mites and you gotta do this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like another natural man.</v>

699
00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:56.210
<v Speaker 2>They've been around longer than we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just let them go.</v>

700
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.130
<v Speaker 2>They know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who,</v>

701

<v Speaker 2>who's to say I know what I'm doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

702
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Do they need specific types of plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them in order to survive?</v>

703
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

704
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.940
<v Speaker 2>something that they can pollinate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

705
00:31:07.941 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 2>it's from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to plant,</v>

706
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what I've planned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've planted stuff that,</v>

707
00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

708
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:21.041
<v Speaker 2>it blooms in the spring and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff that blooms in the summer </v>

709
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:21.041
<v Speaker 2>and then there's other stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blooms,</v>

710
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the late summer.</v>

711
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So they've always got something going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

712
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.960
<v Speaker 2>But they hibernate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hibernate in the winter.</v>

713
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.370
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bears.</v>

714
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have obviously a really cold weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the winter,</v>

717
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.220
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just shut down and stay in the hive</v>

718
00:31:37.221 --> 00:31:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and don't move.</v>

719
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

720
00:31:39.111 --> 00:31:44.111
<v Speaker 2>I don't have bees in vail yet and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to try and figure out how to do </v>

721
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:44.111
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I haven't found a place to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have bees go where there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's less snow,</v>

727
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure something out because it's </v>

728
00:31:59.410 --> 00:31:59.410
<v Speaker 2>something I love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds amazing.</v>

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a beautiful thing,</v>

746
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:47.321
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing about Neil Young's </v>

747
00:32:47.321 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 1>place that he's got some giant ranch up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and Neil young and just chills out</v>

748
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:52.571
<v Speaker 1>and apparently has speaker set up around</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lake where he can be on a boat and </v>

749
00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 1>push the boat out into the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake and the speakers will broadcast.</v>

750
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly set up because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a serious audio file.</v>

751
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see his MP3 thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>created?</v>

752
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch on.</v>

753
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really catch on for some </v>

754
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.291
<v Speaker 1>reason because people were just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to listen to music on their </v>

755
00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:11.291
<v Speaker 1>phones now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

756
00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing little device and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just did that to,</v>

757
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:17.430
<v Speaker 1>to really put that much effort and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intention into something that's not </v>

758
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 1>really necessary in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just shows you what a serious audio file</v>

759
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 1>that guy is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He loves the nature as well.</v>

762
00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And I've been up to his ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:54.960

00:35:57.811 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 2>All that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

825
00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:06.961

<v Speaker 1>you guys have to realize what an </v>

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.290
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably fortunate and amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience you guys are on.</v>

827
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 1>How many people have a dream when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are being a fucking rock star?</v>

828
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 1>How many people get to be in Metallica?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

829
00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:21.100
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

830
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I wake up everyday and think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking blessed.</v>

831
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is unbelievable.</v>

832
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.220
<v Speaker 2>What if I complain once today punched me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face,</v>

833
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid,</v>

834
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact,</v>

835
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:37.100
<v Speaker 2>so stupid that I would complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

836
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tell you,</v>

837
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:45.310
<v Speaker 2>it is hard at times being on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing stuff and when you don't want to </v>

838
00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.340
<v Speaker 2>do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>

839
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.640
<v Speaker 2>But then you find something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find someone,</v>

840
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:54.500
<v Speaker 2>you find a thing and it's usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in the crowd that's just,</v>

841
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see myself right there.</v>

842
00:36:57.141 --> 00:37:01.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm that kid right there at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the motorhead concert looking up at.</v>

843
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Let me go on.</v>

844
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.110

845
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I just suck that energy and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

848
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.560
<v Speaker 1>That was a hard one right when lenny </v>
<v Speaker 1>lenny died.</v>

849
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 1>We went hard to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt he really did.</v>

850
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He fucking war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That breaks out or the tires out fucking</v>

851
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 1>screeched right into the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

852
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't want anyone to know that </v>

853
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 2>it was really that sick and he just kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

854
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.971
<v Speaker 2>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he knew and it's what he </v>

855
00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:40.971
<v Speaker 2>loved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's what he was.</v>

856
00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

857
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought the man was immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.610
<v Speaker 2>he was just this icon of a figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

859
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 2>he was the godfather of heavy music for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

861
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Without him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there certainly wouldn't be a Metallica,</v>

862
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.300
<v Speaker 2>certainly wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

863
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 2>he was the catalyst for Lars and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting together,</v>

864
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ad in the paper,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is that crazy?</v>

869
00:38:13.371 --> 00:38:16.010
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you got back.</v>

870
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how you guys get together back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

871
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 1>That's how you found band members ads in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paper looking for a drummer.</v>

872
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.940
<v Speaker 1>He goes straight to them.</v>

873
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Each section,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

877
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

878

<v Speaker 2>Just get right to age,</v>

880
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>sit heavy metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we should meet.</v>

883
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 2>There's only two of us.</v>

884
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have been through such a </v>

885
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 1>fascinating change in music too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean obviously lars was a huge</v>

886
00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:56.621
<v Speaker 1>figure in the controversy surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>mp3s and that was like during the </v>

887
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 1>napster days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the time where everybody </v>

888
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

889
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.080
<v Speaker 1>something just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

890
00:39:03.081 --> 00:39:05.000
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think we realized it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

891
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I think lars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways was one of the first </v>

892
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.600
<v Speaker 1>people sounding the horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first people going,</v>

893
00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:14.660
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this selling record shit is gonna go</v>

894
00:39:14.661 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

895
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:20.491
<v Speaker 1>do you understand what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just taking things and putting </v>

896
00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:21.590
<v Speaker 1>them online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a totally new thing.</v>

897
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

898
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that poor guy still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:31.010
<v Speaker 2>he's taken bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's taking hits for it still really?</v>

900
00:39:31.011 --> 00:39:36.011
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh everyone who's got a beef with any </v>

901
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:37.100
<v Speaker 2>other thing than a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.610
<v Speaker 2>napster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

903
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.700
<v Speaker 2>it just gravitates towards that all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

904
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.380
<v Speaker 2>That poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:47.381
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got beat up by that and we all stood </v>

906
00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:47.450
<v Speaker 2>behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he was the spokesman for it.</v>

907
00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:48.270
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

908
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.420
<v Speaker 2>he chose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chose to do that.</v>

909
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Management said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

910
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.200
<v Speaker 2>this is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is coming,</v>

911
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.770
<v Speaker 2>let's be the ones that stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

912
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.740
<v Speaker 2>And he took that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

913
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>he grabbed the flag is that I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were lots of other musicians </v>

914
00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:12.281
<v Speaker 2>and people that were on board as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't as vocal or taking the </v>

915
00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.070
<v Speaker 2>hits like he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about,</v>

916
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like a Dr Dre,</v>

917
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 2>he was on board with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason in the rap world </v>

918
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

919
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.190
<v Speaker 2>it's all about money.</v>

920
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

921
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.700
<v Speaker 2>so what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for heavy metal,</v>

922
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>there was some kind of stigma around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

924
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole if you're rich or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been successful or something.</v>

925
00:40:36.861 --> 00:40:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got to pull you down into </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell with us,</v>

926
00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

927
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.230
<v Speaker 2>don't be getting good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

928
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was that stigma.</v>

929
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:48.020
<v Speaker 2>But there were other artists that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>show up at shows saying,</v>

930
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.810
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you're doing what you're</v>

931
00:40:50.811 --> 00:40:51.800
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

932
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:52.700
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

933
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.800
<v Speaker 2>join us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

934
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My career would be over.</v>

935
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:59.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck,</v>

936
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so frustrating.</v>

937
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

938
00:41:02.991 --> 00:41:05.160
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

939
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Then stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

940
00:41:06.741 --> 00:41:07.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

941
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.560
<v Speaker 2>it will fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something will happen.</v>

942
00:41:09.561 --> 00:41:10.520
<v Speaker 2>My fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah.</v>

943
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were concerned about their own </v>

944
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.690
<v Speaker 2>careers and not the big picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

945
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:22.550
<v Speaker 2>And obviously these days you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no copyright laws,</v>

946
00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:23.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

947
00:41:23.631 --> 00:41:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you can rip this and that and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do whatever you want with it.</v>

948
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a beauty to that and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity comes out of it,</v>

949
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but it gets watered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

950
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

951
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we acknowledged that.</v>

952
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:43.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an inspiration somewhere for </v>

953
00:41:43.361 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 2>everything blatantly taking that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it is,</v>

954
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.210
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty frustrating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

955
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 2>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

956
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:54.401
<v Speaker 2>we were at that point where we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a such a following.</v>

957
00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.520
<v Speaker 2>We had such a strength in Metallica that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we survived all of that stuff.</v>

958
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of bands that </v>

959
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't sustain themselves,</v>

961
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.110
<v Speaker 2>couldn't feed their families because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

962
00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:14.111
<v Speaker 2>And I think the frustrating part was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one really understood that music is our </v>

963
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:22.180
<v Speaker 2>if you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take our,</v>

965
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 2>like the way we wanted to present our </v>
<v Speaker 2>music is part of the art.</v>

966
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an album,</v>

967
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.400
<v Speaker 1>meaning like one song leads to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>song winning</v>

968
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 2>well like releasing an album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how we'd like to release it.</v>

969
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't want it leaked over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want this happening.</v>

970
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 2>We don't know a present a presentation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is part of the art.</v>

971
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Like when you walk into an art studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artist has been in there putting it </v>

972
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>together like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

973
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I want you to see this first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that.</v>

974
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you go here and you get Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

975
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:59.230
<v Speaker 2>that there's a passion behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone just throws it out </v>

976
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.311
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it kind of loses a leaves an </v>

977
00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

978
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm complaining punched me in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

979
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 2>but we have survived and we feel good </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and we've adapted.</v>

980
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.250
<v Speaker 2>But the record companies certainly did </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

981
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took it</v>

982
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.990
<v Speaker 1>a hard hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

983
00:43:18.991 --> 00:43:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the record deals,</v>

984
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the deal that record companies make with</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists and you see like what,</v>

985
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.430
<v Speaker 1>what a record company selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

986
00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:28.950
<v Speaker 1>they're only selling your work without </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work,</v>

987
00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:31.860
<v Speaker 1>without your creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without your creations.</v>

988
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they sell.</v>

989
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at these insanely one </v>
<v Speaker 1>side and deals that they cut with </v>

990
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.251
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially emerging artists that might </v>

991
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:43.590
<v Speaker 1>be a little bit more desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't realize that potential,</v>

992
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.170
<v Speaker 1>especially the potential for income that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have in the future.</v>

993
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of those.</v>

994
00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:52.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was that one that somebody said </v>

995
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that courtly love didn't really write </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

996
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:55.080
<v Speaker 1>that it was ghost written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck wrote it,</v>

997
00:43:55.081 --> 00:43:57.090
<v Speaker 1>but courtly love put it out saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she wrote it,</v>

998
00:43:57.091 --> 00:44:02.091
<v Speaker 1>but it was a breakdown of how artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money from the creation of an </v>

999
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 1>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a creation of an album to having it sold</v>

1000
00:44:05.651 --> 00:44:10.100
<v Speaker 1>and record stores to where the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets extracted and how much is left with</v>

1001
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the actual artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking disturbing.</v>

1002
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even A.</v>

1003
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1004
00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:20.431
<v Speaker 2>A couple of years ago we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the rights to our catalog or our </v>

1005
00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:24.820
<v Speaker 2>music from kill 'em all up until now we </v>
<v Speaker 2>own it finally,</v>

1006
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.040
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My tell my kids,</v>

1007
00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1008
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.760
<v Speaker 2>let's go celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got,</v>

1009
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 2>we got the master recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we own it finally.</v>

1010
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 2>And they were just looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you talking about?</v>

1011
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it yours?</v>

1012
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll have a little talk about how </v>

1013
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.890
<v Speaker 2>it was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1014
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you would somewhat sell a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your soul to get a bigger something,</v>

1015
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:55.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was basically the record company was </v>

1016
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 2>a bank and a marketing tool to get you </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want it to be.</v>

1017
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.210
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1018
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 2>it was a necessary thing at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's great to have our stuff back </v>

1019
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1020
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 2>we own our own record press.</v>

1021
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 2>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1022
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.940
<v Speaker 2>In Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our management people found a </v>

1023
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.381
<v Speaker 2>place that had some machines that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sale and we bought one and so we </v>

1024
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 2>press our own vinyl man and we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of do whatever we want.</v>

1025
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 2>What color vinyl today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 2>or what crazy things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys can kind of do whatever the </v>

1028
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:33.700
<v Speaker 2>fuck you want now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1029
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 2>But you don't need a record company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do anything.</v>

1030
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

1031
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a record company.</v>

1032
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 2>We own our own in America or North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1033
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world is a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tougher,</v>

1034
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of countries out there,</v>

1035
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:51.561
<v Speaker 2>especially in Europe and there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can deal with the distribution in </v>

1036
00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 2>each different country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've cut really good deals with,</v>

1037
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.910
<v Speaker 2>with other record companies that have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision and a,</v>

1038
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.920
<v Speaker 2>have a love for Metallica and understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is powerful stuff and people </v>

1039
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 2>love it and we want to be part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1040
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having your own record press is </v>

1041
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.250
<v Speaker 2>pretty darn cool thing that was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired by Jack White,</v>

1042
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1043
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1044
00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.040
<v Speaker 2>white stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>

1045
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 2>they rec on tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done a lot of stuff,</v>

1046
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.720
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves that stuff.</v>

1047
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>He's pressing his own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's coming up with different ways of </v>

1048
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 2>doing vinyls and colors and hidden </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks and cool stuff like that.</v>

1049
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:38.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just another way to get creative </v>

1050
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your career is vinyl.</v>

1051
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 2>What's selling more than anything now </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to actual physical hard </v>

1052
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:48.980
<v Speaker 2>copies of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the numbers and they're </v>

1053
00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.701
<v Speaker 2>probably very all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but vinyl has never gone away and it's,</v>

1054
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's coming back,</v>

1055
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:01.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's more popular than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just something tactile </v>

1056
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.931
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something great that people are </v>

1057
00:47:05.931 --> 00:47:06.330
<v Speaker 2>finally understanding that you can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at artwork,</v>

1058
00:47:06.331 --> 00:47:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

1059
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:14.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ritualization of opening up the </v>

1060
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it out and blowing on it,</v>

1061
00:47:16.741 --> 00:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>clean and it putting it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>setting the needle down.</v>

1062
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's something really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1063
00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I came down to La a few months ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hung out with some high school buddies.</v>

1064
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1065
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:33.381
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to some songs and he </v>

1066
00:47:33.381 --> 00:47:34.880
<v Speaker 2>takes out the Kansas Angel album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it on and.</v>

1067
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1068
00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:42.740
<v Speaker 1>this sounds</v>

1069
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were actually listening to music,</v>

1070
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to it.</v>

1071
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 2>My kids got into vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a,</v>

1072
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at urban outfitter,</v>

1073
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.230
<v Speaker 2>you buy the little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the setup now and that's where they,</v>

1074
00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 2>that's where you can get vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1075
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.190
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some record stores out there,</v>

1076
00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:06.191
<v Speaker 2>but that's where they gravitate towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got them this little player and uh,</v>

1077
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:11.590
<v Speaker 2>they just picked out some album covers </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating even know who they were just </v>

1078
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:11.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cow,</v>

1079
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.680
<v Speaker 2>this cover looks cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this speaks to me.</v>

1080
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm buying this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember telling them that kind of </v>

1081
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool cover.</v>

1082
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I discovered tons of bands.</v>

1083
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 2>So they go into the room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leave them alone for awhile and they </v>

1084
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:24.860
<v Speaker 2>come back and I haven't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1085
00:48:24.861 --> 00:48:26.150
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look in there,</v>

1086
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:27.530
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1087
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>the record players on the floor covers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff strewn out all over the place </v>

1088
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 2>and they're laying on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to.</v>

1089
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what that was me,</v>

1090
00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:37.940
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1091
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.980
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter comes out and she said,</v>

1092
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.390
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never guess what,</v>

1093
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 2>like what their songs</v>

1094
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.000
<v Speaker 1>on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1095
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a CD,</v>

1096
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1097
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.310
<v Speaker 1>she discovered some huge thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1098
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was one of the things that was</v>

1099
00:48:55.311 --> 00:49:00.311
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this vinyl sales outperformed </v>

1100
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:03.491
<v Speaker 1>digital downloads for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shows a significant shift in how </v>

1101
00:49:03.921 --> 00:49:06.350
<v Speaker 1>people are consuming music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

1102
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Stick man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

1103
00:49:07.741 --> 00:49:12.741
<v Speaker 2>that's just cool in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more ways you can get music to </v>

1104
00:49:12.871 --> 00:49:14.340
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>

1105
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing that you were </v>

1106
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a whole presentation.</v>

1107
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 1>The album cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you opened it up,</v>

1108
00:49:20.451 --> 00:49:25.451
<v Speaker 1>the inside the artwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that represents your vision of what </v>

1109
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you guys are trying to put out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the things that kind</v>

1110
00:49:27.021 --> 00:49:30.260
<v Speaker 1>of went away with digital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden there were no album</v>

1111
00:49:30.261 --> 00:49:31.940
<v Speaker 1>covers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the CD was that big,</v>

1112
00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.320
<v Speaker 1>so you couldn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't,</v>

1113
00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tiny little piece of art and</v>

1114
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:37.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're downloading it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even getting that,</v>

1115
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just getting the music itself.</v>

1116
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1117
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and you would get downloadable artwork </v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really looking at the </v>

1118
00:49:46.111 --> 00:49:49.500
<v Speaker 2>artwork while you're listening to it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mobile device,</v>

1119
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1120
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.970
<v Speaker 2>the event of sitting down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1121
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.300
<v Speaker 2>and disappearing into the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.580
<v Speaker 2>being a real music listener,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not while you're driving.</v>

1123
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1124
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.120
<v Speaker 2>it's keeping you from killing people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>

1125
00:50:03.121 --> 00:50:07.680
<v Speaker 2>but when you go home and you sit and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get lost in stuff.</v>

1126
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Even like those cheap friggin </v>
<v Speaker 2>headphones,</v>

1127
00:50:12.271 --> 00:50:13.800
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little earbuds,</v>

1128
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:18.980
<v Speaker 2>my kids were listening to stuff on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys haven't experienced </v>

1129
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.650
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1130
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.710
<v Speaker 2>good sound here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try these headphones on the like,</v>

1131
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.710
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear stuff I didn't hear before.</v>

1132
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just seeing my kids get excited </v>

1133
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 2>about going to a live concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 2>they go there and they absorb it in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every sense.</v>

1135
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:43.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not just having your ears hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and that will never be,</v>

1136
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the frigging goggles or some kind </v>

1137
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 2>of audio visual stuff will reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>live shows,</v>

1138
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:59.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about being next </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a sweaty fucker at a Gig and you </v>

1139
00:50:59.581 --> 00:51:01.950
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pushing you or uh,</v>

1140
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing someone headbang wildly are </v>

1141
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 2>getting thrown over the top of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just so much smells,</v>

1142
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.300
<v Speaker 2>things like that that just can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreated.</v>

1143
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.400
<v Speaker 2>So live music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter,</v>

1144
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:18.401
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that guy just pressed a </v>

1145
00:51:18.401 --> 00:51:21.581
<v Speaker 2>button on his computer and he's singing </v>
<v Speaker 2>over his own music that's not </v>

1146
00:51:21.581 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 2>performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1147
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 2>she discovered that on her own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1148
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 2>these guys are actually playing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments and they fucked up.</v>

1149
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up a song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so cool.</v>

1150
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw something that I wouldn't have,</v>

1151
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool like that.</v>

1152
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lip syncing thing,</v>

1153
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:43.541
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to see a concert and you </v>

1154
00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 2>find out that people that lip sanking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so disturbing.</v>

1155
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just what have you done with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what is the point of this?</v>

1156
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It is disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is live performance?</v>

1157
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:56.561
<v Speaker 2>Live performance is supposed to be your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in this thing actually </v>

1158
00:51:56.561 --> 00:52:00.131
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're watching this person express </v>

1159
00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:00.131
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're not.</v>

1160
00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to be pretending.</v>

1161
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you pretending you're you will get </v>

1162
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 2>money back because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

1163
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretending.</v>

1164
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:15.461
<v Speaker 2>That's not singing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not gone to see plenty of shows with my </v>

1165
00:52:15.461 --> 00:52:17.190
<v Speaker 2>kids and you can tell it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1166
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:21.530

<v Speaker 2>still sing in and it's like,</v>

1167
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 2>well they have to have the backing </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks.</v>

1168
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1169
00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.730
<v Speaker 2>they're dancing and they're out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath like,</v>

1170
00:52:25.731 --> 00:52:28.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stopped dancing to the song.</v>

1171
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean are you a dancer or you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>musician or singer in cardio?</v>

1172
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Just start running hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be Diego to Vail and run up.</v>

1173
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 2>The 14 are exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be done,</v>

1174
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen shows where there's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and then he'll get real,</v>

1175
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:51.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit down on a couch plugging and </v>

1176
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.911
<v Speaker 2>acoustic and sing out a key and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really try and struggle with a song or </v>

1177
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 2>sing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's natural.</v>

1179
00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:01.780
<v Speaker 2>That feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would not gravitate towards that </v>

1180
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 2>than listening to the album?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to listen to the album.</v>

1181
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>A home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:09.070
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's cool to just see an </v>
<v Speaker 2>acoustic set sometimes from people you </v>

1183
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like it's as minimal as possible.</v>

1184
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>You're breaking it down to the bare </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones,</v>

1185
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>just a guitar and sing it or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1186
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty intimidating.</v>

1187
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I tell you when we do like that Neil </v>
<v Speaker 2>young benefit where it's,</v>

1192
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.310
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like when,</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing and they put makeup on you.</v>

1195
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing that?</v>

1196
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1210
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:06.850

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1212
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:12.410

<v Speaker 2>three guys get the stuff put on and then</v>

1213
00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I show up,</v>

1214
00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.970
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1216
00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:21.210

<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That dude sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.940
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1219
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.240
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to the napster thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen with Lars,</v>

1220
00:54:28.241 --> 00:54:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1221
00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what's really happening and this</v>

1222
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:37.090
<v Speaker 1>is how people look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really happening was like all</v>

1223
00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden this door got opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Pandora's box got open,</v>

1224
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:42.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you guys were looking at it going,</v>

1225
00:54:42.641 --> 00:54:43.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1226
00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose our record sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you do.</v>

1227
00:54:45.521 --> 00:54:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You understand that like people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been consuming music in a certain way,</v>

1228
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.750
<v Speaker 1>had been paying for music and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for music is supported.</v>

1229
00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.100
<v Speaker 1>All these people that are a part of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that makes albums,</v>

1230
00:54:57.101 --> 00:55:00.520
<v Speaker 1>there's this gigantic thing behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all going to go away because you</v>

1231
00:55:00.521 --> 00:55:04.030
<v Speaker 1>just put a hole in the bottom of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money is gonna get dropped out.</v>

1232
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:09.550
<v Speaker 1>But then the way it looks is look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this rich motherfucker.</v>

1233
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

1234
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:12.250
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't appreciate his fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

1235
00:55:12.251 --> 00:55:17.251
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford your album right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if I just download it for </v>

1236
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:18.430
<v Speaker 1>free?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people thought,</v>

1237
00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1238
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.360
<v Speaker 1>people who can afford it will still be </v>
<v Speaker 1>downloading it and then they'll buy it </v>

1239
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.590
<v Speaker 1>when they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't really the case,</v>

1240
00:55:26.591 --> 00:55:26.920
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

1241
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1242
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1243
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for convenience in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology moving forward,</v>

1244
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 2>getting music out to people is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>important part.</v>

1245
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.520
<v Speaker 2>But just make sure the artist gets what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they deserve from it because without </v>

1246
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to become a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants,</v>

1247
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see the paramedics show </v>

1248
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 2>up at my house and it's like a hobby for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1249
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1250
00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really getting paid for what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I should get paid for my creation,</v>

1251
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I'll save your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1252
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people didn't relate that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1253
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>their career or something equivalent.</v>

1254
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I think because the money wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent.</v>

1255
00:56:14.091 --> 00:56:16.040
<v Speaker 1>They looked at you guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are already so rich.</v>

1256
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:18.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you give a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to be broke.</v>

1257
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.590
<v Speaker 1>You guys made millions and millions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars to tour all over the</v>

1258
00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:26.591
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it became touring thing was way </v>

1259
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:26.591
<v Speaker 1>artists made money then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1260
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Touring and merchandise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's now how record companies are </v>

1261
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:32.210
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Structuring their deals,</v>

1262
00:56:32.211 --> 00:56:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1263
00:56:32.571 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 2>we get a piece of your merge in and</v>

1264
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.620
<v Speaker 1>touring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's bizarre though.</v>

1265
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The record companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a piece of your touring to me is</v>

1266
00:56:39.531 --> 00:56:44.531
<v Speaker 1>very strange and I've seen not just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece but an exorbitant amount and that </v>

1267
00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:45.870
<v Speaker 1>disturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1268
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.060
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way they can survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1269
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be around them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you become a parasite because you </v>

1270
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 1>don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1271
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:55.430
<v Speaker 1>especially now where bands can literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>become gigantic because of Youtube.</v>

1272
00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:00.820
<v Speaker 1>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin bieber become huge just entirely </v>

1273
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:00.820
<v Speaker 1>because of youtube.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know it was a.</v>

1278
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1279
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you the,</v>

1280
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.250
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1281
00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

1282
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:18.800
<v Speaker 2>would you go up to the artist and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out of his pocket?</v>

1283
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you go into a record store and </v>

1284
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 2>just lift that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal it,</v>

1285
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:24.810
<v Speaker 2>run out the door with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.780
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do that with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1287
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1288
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1289
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 2>there's big corporations that are rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and would you go walk in and just steal </v>

1290
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:35.210
<v Speaker 2>their stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1291
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.520
<v Speaker 2>they're software companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>

1292
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.410
<v Speaker 2>What'd you go in there and just rip </v>
<v Speaker 2>their stuff.</v>

1293
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't call me old school,</v>

1294
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.580
<v Speaker 2>but you need to earn what you get and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets stolen from you,</v>

1295
00:57:49.581 --> 00:57:54.581
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense that it's hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fathom and what it seems like to me,</v>

1296
00:57:55.641 --> 00:58:00.641
<v Speaker 2>and I could be talking out my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the record companies dropped the </v>

1297
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:05.201
<v Speaker 2>ball and the new record companies became</v>
<v Speaker 2>itunes in control at all.</v>

1298
00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Here's how much we're charging for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>music and here's how much you're going </v>

1299
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's even.</v>

1300
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like some communist approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.220
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

1302
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're an artist and we make a lot of </v>

1303
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's up to us.</v>

1304
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:25.870
<v Speaker 2>If we give all our money away to charity</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we throw it back into a movie that </v>

1305
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:26.450
<v Speaker 2>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happened,</v>

1306
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our choice.</v>

1307
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.880
<v Speaker 2>We're the fucking artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to do what we want.</v>

1308
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 2>It's our party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're invited and we can destroy this </v>

1309
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:38.330
<v Speaker 2>thing if we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to destroy it.</v>

1310
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The itunes distribution models of very </v>

1311
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 1>bizarre one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange how they've,</v>

1312
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:48.530
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what they're doing and you </v>

1313
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.431
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a system that worked and I'm </v>

1314
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:51.431
<v Speaker 2>up for bucking the system and making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1315
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't get better.</v>

1316
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1317
00:58:54.921 --> 00:58:57.020
<v Speaker 2>the cat got out of the bag and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it back in,</v>

1318
00:58:57.021 --> 00:58:57.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't.</v>

1319
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>

1320
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got spotify or you got something </v>

1321
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.010
<v Speaker 2>else where streaming's going to help get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artists their money and it's,</v>

1322
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1323
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies like that are losing money.</v>

1324
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:14.870
<v Speaker 2>A lot of spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1325
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact workings and I'm </v>

1326
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 2>not going to speak for them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hasn't been figured yet is what</v>

1327
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

1328
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been figured out how to make a</v>

1329
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:30.041
<v Speaker 1>music model work and there's no one way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there will never be one way again </v>

1330
00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still unbalanced.</v>

1331
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Well this technology continues to evolve</v>
<v Speaker 1>and change is sort of in a lot of ways </v>

1332
00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:42.281
<v Speaker 1>like twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many millions and hundreds of </v>

1333
00:59:42.281 --> 00:59:45.460
<v Speaker 1>millions of people use twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't figure out a way to make </v>

1334
00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 1>money with it is this very strange thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people just want to use stuff,</v>

1335
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:51.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to give you any money so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out some way to </v>

1336
00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.491
<v Speaker 1>extract money from all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>using stuff and if you have a streaming </v>

1337
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:54.491
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1338
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:59.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a free streaming service and I see </v>

1339
00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>some of the fees that they pay artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>for music that's been played millions of</v>

1340
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>times like wasn't what does that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

1341
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was like the most played</v>
<v Speaker 1>song on spotify and then they have the </v>

1342
01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>numbers that the guy got for that actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>song and you're like,</v>

1343
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>well where the fuck is the money going </v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

1344
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1345
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>we're talking a lot about money here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is for Almay to,</v>

1347
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.660

1348
01:00:26.661 --> 01:00:30.290

<v Speaker 1>Looks like you're using an ad blocker.</v>

1349
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using an ad blocker to stop this.</v>

1350
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck Jesus Christ had a display </v>

<v Speaker 1>in song writing royalties from 43 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million plays of his song that I can't </v>

1353

<v Speaker 1>look at the ad because the fucking ad </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocker.</v>

1354
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:51.700

<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business insider.</v>

1356
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1357
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Business insider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you either got it,</v>

1358
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't have the ads just pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1359
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Those are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1360
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it's frustrating I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's another thing.</v>

1361
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>That's how they're making money right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away because nobody wants to buy </v>

1362
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>magazines anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1363
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that's how they're making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not for l,</v>

1364
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>$3.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million plays of happy 2000 bucks.</v>

1365
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a plane ticket for $43 million.</v>

1366
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>

1367
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 1>We talked a lot about money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1368
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about the money and it doesn't </v>

1369
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>mean it shouldn't be anybody's fricking </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1370
01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>How much you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much he makes.</v>

1371
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to reveal it,</v>

1372
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is there such a stigma around </v>

1373
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>being successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that people will just</v>

1374
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>want to repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat for it.</v>

1375
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a disingenuous idea that,</v>

1376
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>or the disingenuous approach to art if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just doing art to make money and </v>

1377
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what people hate.</v>

1378
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>People like what are the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved about your new album is it's </v>

1379
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>totally clear 100 percent that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real metallica album.</v>

1380
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just some ham and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make some money.</v>

1381
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's slap together some shitty ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them metallica album out of it </v>

1382
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>and we know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1383
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking metallica album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1384
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's because you're creating your </v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

1385
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not necessarily doing it saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1386
01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>if we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to make money.</v>

1387
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Then that's I think when people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone's just trying to make </v>

1388
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives them crazy because they,</v>

1389
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>someone people know in their head that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how great artists created </v>

1390
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that you might have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money might be a consequence of </v>

1391
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>great art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1392
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1393
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>let's make a movie that makes $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

1394
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No the fuck it's not.</v>

1395
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna be a bunch of Shitty CGI </v>
<v Speaker 1>and explosions and a hot girl and the </v>

1396
01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>guy and the girl kiss at the end and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1397
01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw it all coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been done before and it's been done</v>

1398
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>before because you're just slapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a formula and that stuff drives</v>

1399
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>people nuts when you know that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing something just for money,</v>

1400
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>so whenever money gets discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people automatically get that sort of </v>

1401
01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>weird distaste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God's money,</v>

1402
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>that fucking money is ruining </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1403
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be doing ballads on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some teenage angst fucking movie next.</v>

1404
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1405
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>that's not hard wired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1406
01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we're still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still.</v>

1408
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>We're men.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The ultimate riff.</v>

1411
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>You're still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's most important.</v>

1412
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>You're still doing it and it can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1413
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I think when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there weren't old rockers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got energy.</v>

1428
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Not only him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>then we'll let you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>soccer players getting brain dead.</v>

1469
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:02.780

<v Speaker 1>but he might give a fuck.</v>

1470
01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the price you pay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>megadeath anthrax,</v>

1475
01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>these four bands that are still going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unbelievably after 35 years myself,</v>

1476
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Dave Mustaine and Tom Arrive all had </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck surgery from all of this head.</v>

1477
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Neck surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of neck surgery?</v>

1478
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a partial diskectomy in like c,</v>

1479
01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I think c six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1480
01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:37.161
<v Speaker 2>So you had a bulging disc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was we pressing on your nerve would </v>

1481
01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:37.161
<v Speaker 2>rest on my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arm.</v>

1483
01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't</v>

1484
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>pick my nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like making your hands numb.</v>

1485
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I couldn't pick my arm up.</v>

1486
01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever do decompression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like spinal decompression chamber?</v>

1487
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spinal decompression.</v>

1488
01:06:49.971 --> 01:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Like they put a harness on your neck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stretch your neck.</v>

1489
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you have one of those at home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to get one of those </v>

1491
01:06:59.020 --> 01:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so simple.</v>

1492
01:06:59.151 --> 01:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just a harness that you put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>straps,</v>

1493
01:07:01.311 --> 01:07:06.311
<v Speaker 1>velcro around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It connects to a door at the top of a </v>

1494
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>door and you just sit down a chair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're hanging yourself.</v>

1495
01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1496
01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:12.610
<v Speaker 1>click this and it just stretches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It carries your weight a little bit on </v>

1497
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still sitting.</v>

1498
01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.670
<v Speaker 1>You could totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1499
01:07:13.671 --> 01:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Like there seat up in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one of those in my house.</v>

1500
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking invaluable.</v>

1501
01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so giant because it's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to legitimately stretch your neck and a </v>

1502
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:27.191
<v Speaker 1>lot of spinal decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of bolts discs and the pain and </v>

1503
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 1>discomfort associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can mitigate a lot of that with one </v>

1504
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 1>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big.</v>

1505
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to wear that shirt right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1506
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>You wear whatever you want to go naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got another thing I'm going to show </v>

1507
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you that's called the iron neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll strengthen your neck up.</v>

1508
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>We were looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy just brought it in last week.</v>

1510
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with it.</v>

1511
01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also good.</v>

1512
01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to do,</v>

1513
01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's also good for not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthening your neck,</v>

1514
01:07:52.311 --> 01:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>but increasing your range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1515
01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine they're all after a while,</v>

1516
01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1517
01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just that,</v>

1518
01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:03.410
<v Speaker 2>but just the posture of your guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1519
01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1520
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you're playing really low and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and you're back.</v>

1521
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's posture stuff,</v>

1522
01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>but I agree that making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

1523
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.920
<v Speaker 2>making it straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making your back straight is harder now </v>

1524
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>than it was leaning against the wall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1525
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that old dude.</v>

1526
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Punched over the middle of his back is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a frigging,</v>

1527
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1528
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1529
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>hunchback of Notre Dame or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It creeps in on you.</v>

1530
01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:34.151
<v Speaker 2>You don't even realize it's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>until it's too late and then you can't </v>

1531
01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:34.151
<v Speaker 2>straighten it back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1532
01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:38.500
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a physical trainer in Vail,</v>

1534
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically keeping range of motion going </v>

1535
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:43.560
<v Speaker 2>core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1536
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of hiking,</v>

1537
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1538
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1539
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:54.671
<v Speaker 2>power bulking up or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just trying to stay mobile.</v>

1540
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure everyone my age has some of</v>

1541
01:08:58.761 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1542
01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spinal stenosis where there's calcium </v>

1543
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:04.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
<v Speaker 2>kind of our threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritic buildup around the nerves </v>

1545
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 2>around your spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So keeping that mobile,</v>

1546
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:16.841
<v Speaker 2>keeping things moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to a holistic healer to who was </v>

1547
01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 2>breaking up calcium on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on fingers and toes and stuff.</v>

1548
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:24.641
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing all I can do and all I can to </v>

1549
01:09:24.641 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 2>get up there and be angus young still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:31.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're experiencing issues with </v>

1551
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:31.511
<v Speaker 2>stenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1552
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that machine can help that a lot.</v>

1553
01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Strengthen your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole spinal cord.</v>

1554
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And I got another thing in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you.</v>

1555
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It's called the reverse hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>

1556
01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it right here.</v>

1557
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 1>It actually helps decompress your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1558
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 1>it decompresses your spinal column and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthens it at the same time.</v>

1559
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's created by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that guy with the black shirt.</v>

1560
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a fucking psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stems,</v>

1561
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Louie Simmons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

1562
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>We interviewed him for the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's completely out of his fucking mind.</v>

1563
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.340
<v Speaker 1>He's been on steroids straight since </v>
<v Speaker 1>1976.</v>

1564
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:03.341
<v Speaker 1>He's never gone off of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed that lady like something's </v>

1565
01:10:03.341 --> 01:10:07.190
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck he's explaining what it does to </v>

1566
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:07.190
<v Speaker 1>your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1567
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 1>that machine man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody with back issues,</v>

1568
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:14.201
<v Speaker 1>any back issue at all because what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine does is it allows your back to </v>

1569
01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>actively decompress from the lower back </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to your,</v>

1570
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your neck area and uh,</v>

1571
01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it strengthens everything and decompress</v>

1572
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1573
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So it lengthens your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stretches all that tissue out and </v>

1574
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 1>pulls all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Fascia and all that stuff out.</v>

1575
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see him like </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating in here when this woman </v>

1576
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>gets up there and see as it goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually pulling your back.</v>

1577
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the only exercise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen that decompresses.</v>

1578
01:10:40.551 --> 01:10:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And then on the lift up strengthens all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those muscles.</v>

1579
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:48.521
<v Speaker 1>And then on the way down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pulls them down and have a bunch of </v>

1580
01:10:48.521 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 1>different things in the back because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some disc issues myself,</v>

1581
01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but I took care of all of them without </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1582
01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Right on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't.</v>

1583
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>The doctors are trying to cut me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1584
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 1>that's the immediate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1585
01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in there,</v>

1586
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably eventually going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have your disks a fuse.</v>

1587
01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1588
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Like wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving around.</v>

1589
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1590
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

1591
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 1>How come you guarantee that it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>get worse?</v>

1592
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it that when you're one at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one state,</v>

1593
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>they never think you can improve this</v>

1594
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>with physical therapy and it can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1595
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Their immediate reaction is it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>get worse.</v>

1596
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 3>So count on getting the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1597
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:22.300
<v Speaker 3>that's what they know and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're schooled on.</v>

1598
01:11:22.301 --> 01:11:27.301
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that you're giving them </v>

1599
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:27.301
<v Speaker 3>the finger and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1600
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to go down that path.</v>

1601
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1602
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of different ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1603
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:35.700
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately mine was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was touching the nerve and I couldn't</v>

1604
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 3>lift my arm and it was atrophy happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so something had to happen.</v>

1605
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 3>But my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1606
01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I've gone onto,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1609
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 3>singing with two broken ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Fun.</v>

1610
01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1611
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:58.470
<v Speaker 3>the back man when it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it hurts,</v>

1612

<v Speaker 3>you turn into a fucking baby man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>

1614
01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have like a torn calf muscle </v>

1615
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 3>and you limp around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you seem to be okay.</v>

1616
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 3>But you're back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1617

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that here it is,</v>

1789
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Definitely having some fun there.</v>

1790
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also a cool thing to see from a </v>

1791
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard band too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1792
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't necessarily take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1793
01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.780
<v Speaker 1>you obviously take yourself seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously,</v>

1794
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you're serious about what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take yourself too seriously.</v>

1795
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

1796
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.720
<v Speaker 2>About your art or art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we write a song,</v>

1797
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're serious about this,</v>

1798
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but when we go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we play live,</v>

1799
01:19:36.191 --> 01:19:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1800
01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:41.380
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not the best musicians separately,</v>

1801
01:19:41.381 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1802
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:46.600
<v Speaker 2>and someone might disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you put us together,</v>

1803
01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:49.810
<v Speaker 2>something happens and we create </v>
<v Speaker 2>something really cool.</v>

1804
01:19:49.811 --> 01:19:54.811
<v Speaker 2>There's an energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think back from the very </v>

1805
01:19:55.151 --> 01:19:58.630
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when someone fucked up the song,</v>

1806
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.910
<v Speaker 2>we just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1807
01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try it again.</v>

1808
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.210
<v Speaker 2>We can do this better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1809
01:20:05.710 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 2>And people said with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to do that.</v>

1810
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not very professional.</v>

1811
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1812
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 2>but that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1813
01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 2>if we're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to do it better and we know we </v>

1814
01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:20.541
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to stop it and do it </v>

1815
01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:20.541
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1816
01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:20.541
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I mean,</v>

1817
01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:24.861
<v Speaker 2>just like the other day I was like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>frigging brainfart on stage where we're </v>

1818
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 2>up there and they play the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intro to one,</v>

1819
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.980
<v Speaker 2>which is like this army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heck you,</v>

1820
01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the war going on.</v>

1821
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 2>And then I start this thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started the wrong song.</v>

1822
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I started to fade to black instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different song.</v>

1823
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do now?</v>

1824
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wave of shame comes over you like </v>

1825
01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>

1826
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking over my roadie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going not that song.</v>

1827
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1828
01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop it.</v>

1829
01:20:57.031 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to the other song and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm able later to go up and say,</v>

1830
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.840
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear faded black again?</v>

1831
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:07.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a joke about it or else you,</v>

1832
01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you become.</v>

1833
01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like you gotta expose your </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable parts.</v>

1834
01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:18.650
<v Speaker 2>People people make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll make fun of that and they'll take </v>

1835
01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:22.440
<v Speaker 2>advantage of it sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the times people will relate</v>

1836
01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1837
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.330
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's human.</v>

1838
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1839
01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trusting that there's more,</v>

1840
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 2>there's more lifeguards than sharks out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there most of the time.</v>

1841
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I think also there's a beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People differentiate the big difference </v>

1843
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.430
<v Speaker 1>between a mistake and someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>careless or doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1844
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very true.</v>

1845
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are obviously very serious </v>

1846
01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:49.391
<v Speaker 1>about what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody occasionally has a brain </v>

1847
01:21:49.391 --> 01:21:49.391
<v Speaker 1>fart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no getting around it.</v>

1848
01:21:49.391 --> 01:21:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the middle of a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcasts and I fucking forget </v>

1849
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:57.521
<v Speaker 1>someone's name and I called their fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 times and I can't remember why I </v>

1850
01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:02.201
<v Speaker 1>can't remember the name and then for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason I have to look down at </v>

1851
01:22:02.201 --> 01:22:02.600
<v Speaker 1>my notes in there it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just angry with myself.</v>

1852
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Just sometimes it just doesn't work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no rhyme or reason to why your </v>

1853
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>brain doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1854
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1855
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So you're tough on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1856
01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm horrible myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>You say this to yourself that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even say to your worst enemy.</v>

1858
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no words.</v>

1859
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just feelings.</v>

1860
01:22:20.591 --> 01:22:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Just I could have a show where I</v>

1861
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.860
<v Speaker 1>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fuck up one word and one joke and </v>

1862
01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that's all I can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just no way.</v>

1863
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:34.080
<v Speaker 1>If you care about what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just part of it.</v>

1864
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

1865
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:40.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a healthy part to that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving on from it is,</v>

1866
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>it's easier now than it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just,</v>

1867
01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 2>it would live in me for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1868
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you forgot the words to that song,</v>

1869
01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.020
<v Speaker 2>and then it becomes a mental block to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get up there and you go,</v>

1870
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1871
01:22:52.151 --> 01:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:54.500
<v Speaker 2>like a kicker or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.230
<v Speaker 2>a guy going to kick a field goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1874
01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed that one.</v>

1875
01:22:56.991 --> 01:22:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the next one,</v>

1876
01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:00.650
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's a thing,</v>

1877
01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:02.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1878
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:04.460
<v Speaker 2>so getting over those mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Fighters a fight and then</v>

1880
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>they come back and then you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort.</v>

1881
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.070
<v Speaker 1>You can see the confusion and the fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1882
01:23:14.071 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the side,</v>

1883
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological issues or some of the </v>

1884
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.501
<v Speaker 1>hardest issues that people ever overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just literally like a pattern </v>

1885
01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:26.431
<v Speaker 1>of thought in your mind or if you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're not as good as you </v>

1886
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:28.220
<v Speaker 1>used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manifest that in there.</v>

1887
01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Like physically you can do all the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1888
01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.190
<v Speaker 1>That is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1889
01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:33.860
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power of thought.</v>

1890
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 2>The power of my mind is it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous at times and being creative,</v>

1891
01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.990
<v Speaker 2>a makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crap,</v>

1892
01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a large largest doing that just to </v>

1893
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 2>fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>

1894
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.090
<v Speaker 2>And then you talk to them later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1895
01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.480
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1896

<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1897
01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:53.550
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1898
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a curse and a gift that creativity,</v>

1899
01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard was it for you to get sober?</v>

1900
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:05.060
<v Speaker 2>A fear was a big motivator in that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>behaviors that I brought home from the </v>

<v Speaker 2>someplace like basically tearing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to bones,</v>

1938
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.540
<v Speaker 2>ripping your life apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you thought about yourself</v>

1939
01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:56.390
<v Speaker 2>or what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you thought you had,</v>

1940
01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your career,</v>

1941
01:25:58.161 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything gone strip you down to just,</v>

1942
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:03.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1943
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 2>here's how you were when you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were okay,</v>

1944
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 2>you're a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good person.</v>

1945
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Let's get back to that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they slowly rebuild you.</v>

1946
01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.950
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1947
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.960
<v Speaker 2>another they call them aftercare places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there to a couple different ones </v>

1948
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:24.200
<v Speaker 2>and they fine tune stuff and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated back into life.</v>

1949
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Because when you're in this cocoon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your frigging raw,</v>

1950
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was raw meat when I came out and you </v>

1951
01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:32.620
<v Speaker 2>can see it in some kind of monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1952
01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty raw still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I could or what I </v>

1953
01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 2>should or shouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that helps relationships.</v>

1956
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 2>So they got me and my wife together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd see people separately and then come</v>

1957
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:54.701
<v Speaker 2>together and talk about what we did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication frigging saved my life </v>

<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1962
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:11.410
<v Speaker 2>She walked through fire with me and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked out together stronger,</v>

1963
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.810
<v Speaker 2>way stronger than we ever would have </v>

01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I can say sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell them,</v>

1969
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what happened when I did that.</v>

1970
01:27:35.121 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to preach to them.</v>

1971
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.960
<v Speaker 2>They got their own stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they,</v>

1972
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:44.570
<v Speaker 2>now they goof with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ruined my trust with my family and now</v>

1973
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.820
<v Speaker 2>by some miracle they are goofing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1974
01:27:48.821 --> 01:27:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

1975
01:27:49.791 --> 01:27:51.200
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you get them like,</v>

1976
01:27:51.201 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1977
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.010
<v Speaker 2>your overblowing this your way out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

1978
01:27:55.011 --> 01:27:57.330
<v Speaker 2>you're taken up way too much space here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1979
01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So they helped me and I realized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is help in a loving way.</v>

1980
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.260
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been sober now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>

1981
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen years.</v>

1982
01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Did it start out when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first started doing it,</v>

1983
01:28:10.091 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 1>did it feel like as you broke through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

1984
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to therapy and you got out of </v>

1985
01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Rehab and you're going through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

1986
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Was there a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shaky leg period where you're </v>

1987
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:23.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1988
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.000
<v Speaker 1>do I know who I am anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh absolutely.</v>

1989
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:26.290
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1990
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1991
01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the mind and how,</v>

1992
01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:32.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how my life works.</v>

1993
01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:37.020
<v Speaker 2>And to actually just completely throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>that away and start over,</v>

1994
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1995
01:28:38.041 --> 01:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who am I without this?</v>

1996
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1997
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1998
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shy.</v>

1999
01:28:45.061 --> 01:28:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm all of the stuff that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>booze was helping me with,</v>

2000
01:28:48.631 --> 01:28:50.480
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2001
01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:52.380
<v Speaker 2>booze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

2002
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:55.230
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shopping,</v>

2003
01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.660
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gambling,</v>

2004
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things that can manifest</v>

2005
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:05.220
<v Speaker 2>out that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all goes back to one core thing.</v>

2006
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know who I am.</v>

2007
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 2>So it took years and years and years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>

2008
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

2009
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 2>That's part of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is part of me,</v>

2010
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2011
01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2012
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2013
01:29:17.611 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 2>the quirkiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dork part of me,</v>

2014
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.600
<v Speaker 2>all these little things that make me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to hug them,</v>

2015
01:29:23.601 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I accept them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2016
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.260
<v Speaker 2>and quit running from them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending like I am some immovable </v>

2017
01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.250
<v Speaker 2>object on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tough and you know,</v>

2018
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.110
<v Speaker 2>nothing can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2019
01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:35.010
<v Speaker 2>nothing going to hurt me.</v>

2020
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.270
<v Speaker 2>But inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a cliche saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2022
01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:45.441
<v Speaker 2>the harder that external shield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the softer the inside and the more </v>

2023
01:29:45.441 --> 01:29:47.820
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and balancing that,</v>

2024
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like you're concentrating so much</v>

2025
01:29:50.671 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 2>on the outside that you ignore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

2026
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

2027
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 2>And then forget what I really want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you lose yourself in that other,</v>

2028
01:29:57.510 --> 01:30:00.780
<v Speaker 2>that other person and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in a band,</v>

2029
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:05.440
<v Speaker 2>certainly a accelerated that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2030
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.760
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was drink and drugs and all kinds </v>

2031
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.921
<v Speaker 2>of stuff just thrown at you all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's starts off as a fun little </v>

2032
01:30:12.921 --> 01:30:17.181
<v Speaker 2>thing and then it turns into whiskey and</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape and then all of a sudden you </v>

2033
01:30:17.181 --> 01:30:20.571
<v Speaker 2>don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't remember why you're out there </v>

2034
01:30:20.571 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 2>doing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on tour just so I could go to the</v>

2035
01:30:21.271 --> 01:30:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Strip club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and overcoming a drink here.</v>

2038
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And you knew all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the actual playing on stage,</v>

2039
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 2>it Kinda got forgotten about a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

2040
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:33.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2041
01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:36.120
<v Speaker 2>we get caught up in the rockstar stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a,</v>

2042
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:41.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a song on this album hell Motha </v>
<v Speaker 2>into flame that directly talks about the</v>

2043
01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:47.540
<v Speaker 2>how fame can be this crazy drug and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can completely take you over if you let </v>

2044
01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:49.830
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2045

<v Speaker 2>you're searching for that thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna save you and it's,</v>

2046
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:54.270
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's already there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just gotta you just gotTa find it </v>

2048
01:30:59.271 --> 01:30:59.271
<v Speaker 2>and accept it.</v>

2049
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very down to Earth Guy,</v>

2050
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:04.940
<v Speaker 1>which is very unusual for someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>as famous as you are.</v>

2051
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk to you about this because</v>

2052
01:31:08.391 --> 01:31:10.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now you're,</v>

2053
01:31:10.221 --> 01:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2054
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2055
01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you're just in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it seems like for someone who's</v>

2056
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:19.730
<v Speaker 1>as famous as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets on stage and you know,</v>

2057
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.760
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of people just don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy and you're up there.</v>

2058
01:31:25.431 --> 01:31:30.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has got to be intoxicating and </v>

2059
01:31:30.431 --> 01:31:33.161
<v Speaker 1>confusing and oftentimes I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are a prisoner to whatever image </v>

2060
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:40.510
<v Speaker 1>that either they projected initially or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes how the public perceives them</v>

2061
01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:47.180
<v Speaker 1>because of all their success and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact they go on stage and 100,000</v>

2062
01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>people go fucking ape shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2063
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:55.110
<v Speaker 1>what does that like trying to like find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself while you're also</v>

2064
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 2>kind of worshiped?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2065
01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Well enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hit it?</v>

2066
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the transitions from road to</v>
<v Speaker 2>home or always somewhat difficult.</v>

2067
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ptsd that goes along with it.</v>

2068
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:12.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:20.370
<v Speaker 2>where do I get my validation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really that's where I have to step back </v>

2072
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2073
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 2>am I who these people say I am or think </v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2074
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>They have their own vision or version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2075
01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 2>just like I had my own version of Lemmy,</v>

2078
01:32:39.511 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 2>way and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they meet you in normal life,</v>

2079
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting with your family eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>or your frigging in the supermarket,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

2117
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>we played in front of half a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and a million people.</v>

2118
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 2>And where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in Russia.</v>

2119
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 2>This was a shit in the airfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2120

<v Speaker 2>So we've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck was that like?</v>

2121
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a sea C of Russian people.</v>

2122
01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was,</v>

2123
01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 2>that this was in 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 2>91 91 when the,</v>

2124
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the curtain came down and all of that </v>

2125
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:40.411
<v Speaker 2>and a Time Warner had a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2126
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.720
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to basically get their foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the door and so they were created a </v>

2127
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 2>free concert.</v>

2128
01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Speaker 2>it was a ACDC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

2130
01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Pantera and I think maybe a local band </v>
<v Speaker 2>or some other bands.</v>

2131
01:34:55.241 --> 01:34:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they flew us in there.</v>

2132
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 2>We landed in this airfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2133
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:05.861
<v Speaker 2>Motley crew was on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landed in this airfield and as far as </v>

2134
01:35:05.861 --> 01:35:10.781
<v Speaker 2>the eye could see it when it was a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>concert and it was just people and we </v>

2135
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 2>get on stage and do what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there were,</v>

2136
01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>it was military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2137
01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>military and the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that photo.</v>

2138
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck?</v>

2141
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2142
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:34.280

<v Speaker 2>Is that the one?</v>

2143
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>That might be something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks a little newer,</v>

2144
01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but it says here it was from 91 mosque </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

2145
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty remarkable.</v>

2146
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And there were.</v>

2147
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a sea of people like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see there's a helicopter helicopter </v>

2148
01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 2>flying over people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2149
01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:52.130
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that thing goes down,</v>

2150
01:35:52.131 --> 01:35:55.150
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be chopping up photo.</v>

2151
01:35:55.690 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 2>We can go right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one onstage facing those people.</v>

2152
01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking insane.</v>

2153
01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 2>That helicopter would come down close </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were yelling at people like </v>

2154
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2155
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.810
<v Speaker 2>people were moshing are going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what that was.</v>

2156
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a fight.</v>

2157
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I freaking communist country man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>

2158
01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:18.380
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are getting out of order.</v>

2159
01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 2>This is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the Internet then either.</v>

2160
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what to expect of that.</v>

2161
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So there are people throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting people from the,</v>

2162
01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.630
<v Speaker 2>from the helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And down on the front there,</v>

2163
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>there were guys in uniforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2164
01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.860
<v Speaker 2>there was no police military.</v>

2165
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2166
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.240
<v Speaker 2>so they're standing there and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniforms and after like three or four </v>

2167
01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:40.240
<v Speaker 2>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2168
01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.470
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they took off their stuff and then </v>

2169
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 2>their headbanging and having a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2170
01:36:44.601 --> 01:36:49.601
<v Speaker 2>So we saw the transformation of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2171
01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2172
01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:55.300
<v Speaker 2>closed down society to freedom right </v>
<v Speaker 2>before us individually and in people.</v>

2173
01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like to stand in front</v>

2174
01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:04.340
<v Speaker 2>of 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

2175
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 2>What does this sound like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does the sound of their roars like?</v>

2176
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Pretty massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously,</v>

2177
01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost count it land on 300 and </v>

2178
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:17.440
<v Speaker 2>something thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tell you,</v>

2179
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 2>and they don't speak your language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just such a,</v>

2180
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the power of music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2181
01:37:23.721 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a language in its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connects people.</v>

2182
01:37:26.151 --> 01:37:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2183
01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:31.790
<v Speaker 2>we went to a place that no one spoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>English or people were telling us,</v>

2184
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned English from your lyrics.</v>

2185
01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit man,</v>

2186
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I failed English just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do so well in school.</v>

2187
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2188
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2189
01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:47.240
<v Speaker 2>that is intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

2190
01:37:47.241 --> 01:37:51.130
<v Speaker 2>that's an experience that almost no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's prepared for.</v>

2191
01:37:51.150 --> 01:37:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

2192
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a single human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that can do that and not be </v>

2193
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.870
<v Speaker 2>somewhat</v>

2194
01:37:56.870 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 1>affected by it or at least need a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decompression,</v>

2195
01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.610
<v Speaker 1>lot of downtime to sort of sort that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2196
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence Vale.</v>

2197
01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:50.860
<v Speaker 3>but not enough snow where the elk have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to struggle for food.</v>

2316
01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:52.540
<v Speaker 3>So they eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2317
01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:57.100
<v Speaker 3>lot of mount lines up there though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a massive,</v>

2318
01:42:57.190 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 3>massively thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big animal.</v>

2319
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was huge.</v>

2320
01:43:00.131 --> 01:43:02.650
<v Speaker 3>He was like a thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big ass elk,</v>

2321
01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:05.320
<v Speaker 3>but blow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one was a rifle.</v>

2322
01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shot one there last year with a bow</v>

2323
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:13.620
<v Speaker 3>this year I went with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We unsuccessfully hunted for five days </v>

2324
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.150
<v Speaker 3>and pulled out a rifle and got it done </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an hour.</v>

2325
01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:21.280
<v Speaker 3>I go back and forth with the bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not cheating.</v>

2326
01:43:21.281 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hunting,</v>

2327
01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 3>but if you want some really hunting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best way to go.</v>

2328
01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I am a meat hunter and that's the way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

2329
01:43:27.850 --> 01:43:32.850
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And New bowhunt hunt a the on my ranch </v>

2330
01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:37.850
<v Speaker 3>at home in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2331
01:43:37.851 --> 01:43:40.160
<v Speaker 3>it's just tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough with the black tail,</v>

2332
01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a fairly small deer too.</v>

2333
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty tough.</v>

2334
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I just liked pulling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like target practicing and stuff and </v>

2335
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have gone bowhunting.</v>

2336
01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking a pretty nice</v>

2337
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 2>alk with it when it's the Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

2338
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so amazing and it scares the shit </v>

2339
01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 2>out of you and the screening and friggin</v>
<v Speaker 2>froth</v>

2340
01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.710
<v Speaker 1>beast coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running down at you with a ready to kick</v>

2341
01:44:04.711 --> 01:44:06.390
<v Speaker 1>your ass or fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty intense moment.</v>

2343
01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2344
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:15.700
<v Speaker 2>but I've missed some stuff so much and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2345
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:17.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather use A.</v>

2346
01:44:17.530 --> 01:44:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to get the animal down and done.</v>

2347
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rifles,</v>

2348
01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.600
<v Speaker 1>definitely the best way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bow I bow hunting requires so much </v>

2349
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:27.600
<v Speaker 1>more discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2350
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a constant pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it's a great meditation.</v>

2351
01:44:31.091 --> 01:44:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Just the practice of archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

2352
01:44:32.530 --> 01:44:33.790
<v Speaker 1>not even just bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2353
01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of just I'll have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2354
01:44:35.291 --> 01:44:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll leave here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go home,</v>

2355
01:44:36.851 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot 100 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2356
01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to just clean my head out.</v>

2357
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to just [inaudible] you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't think about anything else other </v>

2358
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:45.610
<v Speaker 1>than that target in order to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2359
01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Especially shooting at like 70 yards or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something long.</v>

2360
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the coolest thing about bose is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unlike rifles,</v>

2365
01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology at such a high level,</v>

2366
01:45:05.301 --> 01:45:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but I have a rifle from three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2367
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just as good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both from three years ago it's.</v>

2368
01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little behind the times,</v>

2369
01:45:12.921 --> 01:45:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got some new technology,</v>

2370
01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you could still use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still kill something with it,</v>

2371
01:45:16.851 --> 01:45:20.690
<v Speaker 1>but the newest stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did the technology and bows,</v>

2372
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:22.340
<v Speaker 1>they essentially innovate every year.</v>

2373
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:55.010
<v Speaker 2>just the way they pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they balance and all that stuff </v>

2387
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2388
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:56.070
<v Speaker 2>with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2389
01:45:56.190 --> 01:46:01.190
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns have come a lot of wastes the long </v>

2390
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:01.320
<v Speaker 2>ways too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this awesome fierce gun that uh,</v>

2391
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon fiber barrel and it's super </v>

2392
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>lightweight for packing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it's down to like six pounds with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scope on it.</v>

2394
01:46:08.341 --> 01:46:10.680
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lightweight.</v>

2395
01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2396
01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go in like sheep hunting or </v>

2397
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:16.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going way up into the mountains.</v>

2398
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I know guys who cut the bottom off </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their toothbrush in order to save </v>

2399
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:22.960
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally they do everything they can.</v>

2400
01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:26.990
<v Speaker 1>They cut every ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it toothbrush for the kid to brush</v>

2401
01:46:26.991 --> 01:46:28.720
<v Speaker 1>your teeth up in the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't brush your teeth,</v>

2402
01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.140
<v Speaker 1>they're going to smell your stinky ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking breath before anything.</v>

2403
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:34.720
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the first thing they </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell.</v>

2404
01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:37.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm in successful guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually eat,</v>

2405
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:42.930
<v Speaker 1>like they'll take pine leaves and chew </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up inside their mouth just so that </v>

2406
01:46:42.930 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 1>their breath doesn't come off as some </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat eating monster Predator to a deer.</v>

2407
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably like one of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>big smells</v>

2409
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.150
<v Speaker 3>is the breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2410
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.200
<v Speaker 3>bio and then your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people smell breath smells </v>

2411
01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 3>worse than their bio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2412
01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>You've got to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially old old guy,</v>

2413
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:03.410
<v Speaker 3>old guy with rotten insides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:47:03.670 --> 01:47:06.450
<v Speaker 3>All that fucking funk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you spray up,</v>

2415
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:08.970
<v Speaker 3>you do all that stuff and get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't spray up.</v>

2416
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2417
01:47:10.021 --> 01:47:10.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've used.</v>

2418
01:47:10.861 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xanax,</v>

2419
01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>you know those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2420
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.900
<v Speaker 3>ozone things in a tree stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've used that where they,</v>

2421
01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.740
<v Speaker 3>they blow ozone on you and it confuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scent that actually works.</v>

2422
01:47:19.741 --> 01:47:22.800
<v Speaker 3>It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be directly on you.</v>

2423
01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 3>And the ozone somehow attaches itself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your scent molecules.</v>

2424
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And then when the deer gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2425
01:47:29.041 --> 01:47:34.041
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't blow off all those red </v>

2426
01:47:34.041 --> 01:47:34.300
<v Speaker 3>flags where he just wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2427
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:36.000
<v Speaker 3>he smells a Predator and he wants a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bolt.</v>

2428
01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2429
01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2430
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I guess it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see the results of it if </v>

2431
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.950
<v Speaker 3>you're in the same spot year after year </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

2432
01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.970
<v Speaker 3>But I'd never know if that stuff works </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're traveling,</v>

2433
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 3>doing different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different places all the time.</v>

2434
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Well most of the hunts I go on our spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stalk.</v>

2435
01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:53.340
<v Speaker 3>So that's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really apply.</v>

2436
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 3>But in that sense when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something spot and stalk,</v>

2437
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 3>you just have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wind.</v>

2438
01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Wind is going towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked.</v>

2439
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're designed for.</v>

2440
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean they can smell things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way I describe it to people is like,</v>

2441
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:08.760
<v Speaker 3>you know how you could smell a skunk if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it got killed like five blocks away.</v>

2442
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:11.970
<v Speaker 3>That's how a deer can smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can smell,</v>

2443
01:48:11.971 --> 01:48:14.670
<v Speaker 3>they can smell you like a skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>

2444
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.170
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get outta here.</v>

2445
01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smell skunk,</v>

2446
01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.840
<v Speaker 3>they bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen them smell you from 100,</v>

2447
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 3>200 yards out and they just catch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>wind like boing boing.</v>

2448
01:48:25.741 --> 01:48:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this bound away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So brush your teeth,</v>

2449
01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:30.840
<v Speaker 3>you get to bottom teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2450
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for the tip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a good idea.</v>

2451
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Fifty three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you to brush her teeth.</v>

2452
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell Rockstar to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2453
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one of the things that </v>

2454
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.770
<v Speaker 3>some people like about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have to wash it,</v>

2455
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:47.400
<v Speaker 3>just go out there and wear the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn closed for five,</v>

2456
01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:49.860
<v Speaker 3>six days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't send off a signal.</v>

2457
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly will.</v>

2458
01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 3>But you're wearing Merino wool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like base layers.</v>

2459
01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:57.060
<v Speaker 3>It actually can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That absorbs most of the smell.</v>

2460
01:48:57.150 --> 01:48:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So you think the baby wipes do good or </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad?</v>

2461
01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a baby wipes pro.</v>

2462
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.440
<v Speaker 3>It's probably better not to smell like </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2463
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Especially human shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'll like a fake cleaning product,</v>

2464
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 3>either fake cleaning product won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anything odd to a deer,</v>

2465
01:49:14.251 --> 01:49:19.251
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's probably specific </v>

2466
01:49:19.251 --> 01:49:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Predator smells that we exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2467
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:22.260
<v Speaker 3>unless you're like a strict vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also hunt,</v>

2468
01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nick,</v>

2469
01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:26.850
<v Speaker 3>you smelled terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can probably smell like a killer.</v>

2470
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're smelling.</v>

2471
01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:30.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know,</v>

2472
01:49:30.781 --> 01:49:34.020
<v Speaker 3>like if they could tap into the mind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a deer when it smells a person,</v>

2473
01:49:34.021 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What alarms go off.</v>

2474
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 3>That would be bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

2475
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:42.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think the red flag of the Cape on the </v>

2476
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:42.621
<v Speaker 3>bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not really red,</v>

2477
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:44.040
<v Speaker 3>it's just something's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2478
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:45.570
<v Speaker 3>what do they see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they hear?</v>

2479
01:49:45.571 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>What do they smell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I guess once you figure that out then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really on how much.</v>

2481
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.640
<v Speaker 2>How much shit did you have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was that,</v>

2482
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 2>the blowback from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hunt show,</v>

2483
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2484
01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I wanted to get into </v>

2485
01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.230
<v Speaker 2>voiceovers so that I took the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a great voice for it.</v>

2486
01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2487
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know it was your voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're doing.</v>

2488
01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.300
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2489
01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did it in a very professional </v>

2490
01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.611
<v Speaker 2>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very controversial show </v>

2491
01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:18.810
<v Speaker 2>because it was a grizzly bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2492
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2493
01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2494
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I took the Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2495
01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get into the voiceover </v>

2496
01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.170
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was offered to me and yeah,</v>

2497
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I probably had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have had a choice whether I did</v>

2498
01:50:31.511 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 2>it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what that was.</v>

2499
01:50:32.890 --> 01:50:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think the main,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main head happened when I did that </v>

2500
01:50:40.451 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 2>show and then we went to go do </v>
<v Speaker 2>Glastonbury,</v>

2501
01:50:42.970 --> 01:50:47.970
<v Speaker 2>which is like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a celebration of a English hippie </v>

2502
01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:55.101
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they somehow caught wind that I'd </v>

2503
01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.340
<v Speaker 2>been a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2504
01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.560
<v Speaker 2>always a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did this show and uh,</v>

2505
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.820
<v Speaker 2>and it was like boycott Metallica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2506
01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 2>don't play the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want that.</v>

2507
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.730
<v Speaker 2>And Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2508
01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we did was we made a,</v>

2509
01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:15.360
<v Speaker 2>we made this silly video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always something going on in </v>

2510
01:51:15.401 --> 01:51:16.780
<v Speaker 2>England where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2511
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:18.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>

2512
01:51:18.731 --> 01:51:21.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a controversy that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen with the,</v>

2513
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2514
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:24.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when an artist shows up,</v>

2515
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:26.140
<v Speaker 2>they do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2516
01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:28.330
<v Speaker 2>they want something special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they want.</v>

2517
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2518
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.900
<v Speaker 2>I did this bear hunting show and so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this movie,</v>

2519
01:51:35.150 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about uh,</v>

2520
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy in England put this movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>together that,</v>

2521
01:51:40.001 --> 01:51:45.001
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depicted old school English hunt </v>

2522
01:51:45.001 --> 01:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>huntsman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2523
01:51:45.251 --> 01:51:46.030
<v Speaker 2>they're on horseback.</v>

2524
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Fox hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2525
01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.120
<v Speaker 2>took doctor in our release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>release the Fox and all the hounds go </v>

2526
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.440
<v Speaker 2>and they go galloping through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2527
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2528
01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:56.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the English countryside,</v>

2529
01:51:57.070 --> 01:52:02.070
<v Speaker 2>and they come to a spot and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting shot at and it's,</v>

2530
01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:08.280
<v Speaker 2>these bears come out of the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shot the hunters and they become</v>

2531
01:52:08.411 --> 01:52:11.170
<v Speaker 2>the hunter and the crowd loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2532
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:12.340
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2533
01:52:12.341 --> 01:52:15.220
<v Speaker 2>right arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bears,</v>

2534
01:52:15.221 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2535
01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.830
<v Speaker 2>so it Kinda just instantly diffused all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bullshit and you know,</v>

2536
01:52:20.831 --> 01:52:22.990
<v Speaker 2>when you're able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we said earlier,</v>

2537
01:52:22.991 --> 01:52:26.140
<v Speaker 2>make fun of yourself and make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy.</v>

2538
01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of goes away and then you just </v>

2539
01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>get on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2540
01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:32.560
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back to business,</v>

2541
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:37.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it frustrating when they were </v>

2542
01:52:37.561 --> 01:52:37.561
<v Speaker 2>distributing that picture that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even you?</v>

2543
01:52:37.561 --> 01:52:40.600
<v Speaker 2>There was a photo of some guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked kind of like you in front of this</v>

2544
01:52:40.601 --> 01:52:41.680
<v Speaker 2>giant brown bear.</v>

2545
01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2546
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>told me about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're ignorant and that's not </v>

2547
01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>even me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2548
01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2549
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.880
<v Speaker 2>there are people out there that want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2550
01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:57.460
<v Speaker 2>just want to throw the fuel on the fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it crazier and get upset about </v>

2551
01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2552
01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2553
01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I got no control over that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2554
01:53:03.201 --> 01:53:04.930
<v Speaker 2>once it's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2555
01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spend all my time </v>
<v Speaker 2>justifying what I do or don't do it.</v>

2556
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:13.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not even something that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2557
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of time.</v>

2558
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you bear hunt at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

2559
01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I wear clothes.</v>

2560
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bear?</v>

2561
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:25.640
<v Speaker 2>That was really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2562
01:53:25.641 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like stupid jokes.</v>

2563
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you hunt bear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2564
01:53:31.881 --> 01:53:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

2565
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I went to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Khan Chaka and hunt bear.</v>

2566
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

2567
01:53:39.201 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 2>it was a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy adventure.</v>

2568
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Was it brown bear or what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they have up there?</v>

2569
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was brown.</v>

2570
01:53:44.661 --> 01:53:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Bear it wouldn't eat any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2571
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:51.760
<v Speaker 2>no I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one regret I have and I mean </v>

2572
01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:51.760
<v Speaker 2>getting the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2573
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>for some reason they didn't allow you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring meat from Russia into America,</v>

2574
01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 2>but we did have meat there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had meat from other bears and so </v>

2575
01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:07.781
<v Speaker 2>that's how we sustained ourselves out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the shot is brown bear.</v>

2576
01:54:08.061 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2577
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 2>bear doesn't taste great to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This super fatty for sure.</v>

2578
01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2579
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:18.710
<v Speaker 2>this was less fatty because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring bear and then,</v>

2580
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were out,</v>

2581
01:54:19.930 --> 01:54:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't,</v>

2582
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:22.160
<v Speaker 2>they just come out of hibernation.</v>

2583
01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 2>So he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2584
01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:30.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not my favorite thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll probably wouldn't hunt it again </v>

2585
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.470
<v Speaker 2>because I do like to eat what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a harvest so it wasn't,</v>

2586
01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:35.000
<v Speaker 2>wasn't great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had links.</v>

2587
01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:37.340
<v Speaker 2>We had all kinds of different stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that they,</v>

2588
01:54:37.341 --> 01:54:38.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they right in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2589
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Links.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2590
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.380
<v Speaker 2>What does that taste like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes like chicken.</v>

2591
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Everything tastes like chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2592
01:54:45.690 --> 01:54:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how you cook it.</v>

2593
01:54:47.181 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's meat and it tasted like meat and we</v>

2594
01:54:51.201 --> 01:54:55.640
<v Speaker 2>were in this little little hut that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>super short because,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

2596
01:54:56.841 --> 01:55:01.841
<v Speaker 2>really cold out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was like about eight feet of </v>

2597
01:55:01.841 --> 01:55:01.841
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2598
01:55:01.841 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this little hut that's really </v>

2599
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>short to keep warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2600
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
