<v Speaker 3>Much respect to the Korean Zombie.</v>

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo was wearing a Korean Zombie shirt.</v>

13
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 3>And what this means for you,</v>

14
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 3>non MMA people.</v>

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Chan,</v>

16
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 3>some Junge who's the,</v>

17
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 3>they call them the Korean Zombie.</v>

18
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 3>That's his nickname.</v>

19
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.330
<v Speaker 3>And this weekend on a Saturday night at the UFC against Leonard Garcia,</v>

20
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 3>he pulled off the first twister ever in the UFC.</v>

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 3>And the significance of course is at Eddie Bravo.</v>

22
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Our guests today actually invented the twister.</v>

23
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't invent it.</v>

24
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

25
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 3>you invented the rest.</v>

26
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Set up the setup.</v>

27
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 3>The setups.</v>

28
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

29
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.211
<v Speaker 3>The finishing move.</v>

30
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

31
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 3>when you called the rustling mode,</v>

32
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 3>but people used to finish people within wrestling.</v>

33
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

34
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 3>but did they do it your way with the s grip on the forehead?</v>

35
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was all like your,</v>

36
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 3>your uh,</v>

37
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 3>innovation to turn into submission.</v>

38
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

40
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:24.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:24.871
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

42
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.704
<v Speaker 1>People were cranky.</v>

43
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they were cranking and exactly the way I crank it,</v>

44
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure,</v>

45
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.773
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 3>you seen other people get submitted with it before you ever started doing it?</v>

47
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>We would like to,</v>

48
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>in high school,</v>

49
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled a couple of years and then I wrestled in Santa Anna High and in ninth</v>

50
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>grade a guy named Jesse Barrios and another guy,</v>

51
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>his buddy is the one who showed me,</v>

52
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name,</v>

53
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even remember it from my book,</v>

54
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>but Jesse Barrios is his friend,</v>

55
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Santa Ana high school in 1985.</v>

56
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>If anybody out there is from that,</v>

57
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>there's Jesse Barrios friend,</v>

58
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the other leg rider on that wrestling team.</v>

59
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

60
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his name was.</v>

61
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

62
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>he showed it to me and both of those and in wrestling,</v>

63
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>leg riding is for weak people.</v>

64
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And all that means is,</v>

65
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

66
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.401
<v Speaker 1>we need,</v>

68
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.031
<v Speaker 1>we're so weak,</v>

69
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:16.031
<v Speaker 1>we need to use our legs a lot more than the big strong dudes who are wrestling</v>

70
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:16.271
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

71
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

72
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and hitting the weights and had big chest and shoulders.</v>

73
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Those guys really didn't rely on their legs as much as the weak guys like me.</v>

74
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I would skip Russ,</v>

75
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting practice.</v>

77
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I was in the back of the house hiding.</v>

78
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

79
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I was weak.</v>

80
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Even back then.</v>

81
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I was a terrible athlete.</v>

82
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a great athlete,</v>

83
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>so I had to rely on using my legs.</v>

84
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

85
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.044
<v Speaker 1>they came to me,</v>

87
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Jesse came to me and I go,</v>

88
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:40.611
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

89
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>you'll be perfect for this.</v>

90
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>cause they knew I would just get out,</v>

92
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>just get smashed if I try to go heads up with people.</v>

93
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pending move in that I learned in wrestling.</v>

94
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

95
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.631
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

96
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I got pretty good at it.</v>

97
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

98
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>that was my shit.</v>

99
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.961
<v Speaker 1>Even in high school.</v>

100
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:57.351
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>

101
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing I always tried.</v>

102
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I got some cool ass stories that maybe one day I'll,</v>

103
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

104
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.591
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

105
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.211
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about them,</v>

107
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but I have some cool wrestling stories.</v>

108
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.071
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

109
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I sucked at wrestling.</v>

110
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I only had one take down two fucking years.</v>

111
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.204
<v Speaker 1>I sucked.</v>

112
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So I just totally relied on leg riding and and using the,</v>

113
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it's actually called the guillotine.</v>

114
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not called the twister,</v>

115
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it's called the guillotine,</v>

116
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but when I started doing it in Jujitsu,</v>

117
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Higgin Machado and John John Machado would just call it the twister because the</v>

118
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>guillotine already existed.</v>

119
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that that think that I'd like took this</v>

120
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>wrestling move and I said,</v>

121
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to fool the world and change the name and say I invented it.</v>

122
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands of people that think that it's hilarious.</v>

123
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>In my books from day one,</v>

124
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I I,</v>

125
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.230
<v Speaker 3>it was good people to hold on.</v>

126
00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So you're being a little bit modest because you invented all these setups and</v>

127
00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:51.020
<v Speaker 3>turned it into a very high percentage finish.</v>

128
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

129
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.310
<v Speaker 3>You did a lot of signups from a lot of different places where it became,</v>

130
00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing,</v>

131
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.900
<v Speaker 3>none of that stuff existed,</v>

132
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.700
<v Speaker 3>but this is the transition.</v>

133
00:03:58.701 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

134
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I ended up quitting wrestling.</v>

135
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:01.371
<v Speaker 1>The work,</v>

136
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:02.204
<v Speaker 1>the work,</v>

137
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 1>the work will,</v>

138
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.101
<v Speaker 1>the work ethic,</v>

139
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you need to be a good wrestler or something that is just not in my body.</v>

140
00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:07.844
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry.</v>

141
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I was not made to work really hard physically I,</v>

142
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

143
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I hated work.</v>

144
00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Regular jobs.</v>

145
00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I knew that's why it was all about rock stardom or,</v>

146
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.320
<v Speaker 1>or playing football.</v>

147
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

148
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I just want her to be like a famous dude who just played for a living and got</v>

149
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>paid and it was a fucking adored by everybody.</v>

150
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:27.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanted.</v>

151
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to work.</v>

152
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:29.714
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

153
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.531
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

154
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't want,</v>

155
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

156
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>what worked like actually like killed me inside.</v>

157
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>So it drove my artistic side.</v>

158
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>So once I realized that Mexicans don't play football,</v>

159
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

160
00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:42.411
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

161
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I was in ninth grade and I was the slowest motherfucker out there.</v>

162
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

163
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.850
<v Speaker 1>and the owl,</v>

164
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

165
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I had these dreams of playing football or make it an a music that football was</v>

167
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:54.020
<v Speaker 1>crushed in ninth grade.</v>

168
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Once everyone starts to grow,</v>

169
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.721
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

170
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:57.021
<v Speaker 1>Junior,</v>

171
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 1>all American and pee wee football,</v>

172
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up.</v>

173
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I played defensive lineman and middle linebacker in football.</v>

174
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I actually thought I was going to be a defensive lineman and a middle linebacker</v>

175
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>because when you're eight and year nine,</v>

176
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone is the same size.</v>

177
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

178
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you did some brainwashing going on that really thought I was going to be a</v>

179
00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:16.244
<v Speaker 1>football player.</v>

180
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I really thought I was until ninth grade shit.</v>

181
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

182
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:20.210
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

183
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.440
<v Speaker 1>when I was in sixth grade,</v>

184
00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to make the football team because in my neighborhood,</v>

185
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>in my neighborhood,</v>

186
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.751
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty,</v>

188
00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I was a pretty good football player around Mexicans from like a really poor</v>

189
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

190
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty bad ass.</v>

191
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.230
<v Speaker 1>But when you go to school,</v>

192
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.741
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>

193
00:05:33.741 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 1>when I went to sixth grade and then junior,</v>

194
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:35.811
<v Speaker 1>all American,</v>

195
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>

196
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.760
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

197
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 1>peewee football was pretty,</v>

198
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good.</v>

199
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.260
<v Speaker 1>But once people start growing and start changing,</v>

200
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:43.094
<v Speaker 1>and sixth grade,</v>

201
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I went to sixth grade and I didn't make the football team.</v>

202
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>They cut me off far from the,</v>

203
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

204
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

205
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.761
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

206
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I was so embarrassing,</v>

207
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but it was flag football.</v>

208
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't tackle.</v>

209
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>So in my head I'm like,</v>

210
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>wait until ninth grade when I get the high school,</v>

211
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna play some tap cause I'm going to show you what the fuck's going on.</v>

212
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I was thinking that I go,</v>

213
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck this year fucks it's sixth grade.</v>

214
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.170
<v Speaker 1>So seventh grade I transferred myself to a far,</v>

215
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.360

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>a school far away that I only went to,</v>

217
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>cause there's another story,</v>

218
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>there's more stories where I was driven away from my junior high school.</v>

219
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So I went to another school.</v>

220
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I tried out for the football team in the seventh grade.</v>

221
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I got good again,</v>

222
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was flag football.</v>

223
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But I was so embarrassed that I told,</v>

224
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I told my friends growing up,</v>

225
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>all my kids,</v>

229
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.231
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

230
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.100

231
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>So they had to cut me.</v>

232
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:32.691

<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

235
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>the kids that I grew up with thought I made the team,</v>

236
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>but I got cut because I got in a fight with a dude.</v>

237
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I kept that going.</v>

238
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I was so embarrassed that I didn't make the team.</v>

239
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I was so embarrassed and then in the eighth grade,</v>

240
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.501
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

241
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:52.334
<v Speaker 1>one of my,</v>

242
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.030
<v Speaker 1>the guys that I grew up with winter,</v>

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>he made the team.</v>

245
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.774
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>

246
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make the team again.</v>

247
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>He never brought up the fact that he never asked anybody,</v>

248
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>didn't even make the team last year.</v>

249
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>That never got brought up.</v>

250
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>They never humiliated me.</v>

251
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were talking behind my back like like I don't know.</v>

252
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>No one ever brought it up,</v>

253
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but I did lie about it and I'm coming clean with it now.</v>

254
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I totally lied about it.</v>

255
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think for dudes that competition like that,</v>

256
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 1>any kind of competition,</v>

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 1>whether it's football or wrestling or anything,</v>

258
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>is it so important for kids and they're growing up to know how hard it is?</v>

259
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to get good at something,</v>

260
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.350
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.041
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

263
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're Mexican and you think you're going to be a football player,</v>

264
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>look at reality.</v>

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.243
<v Speaker 1>There's not that very,</v>

268
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>there's one Mexican and he plays quarterback.</v>

269
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>You think you're going to be him?</v>

270
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Get Out,</v>

271
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>get out of football,</v>

272
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>get that shit out of your head if you're Mexican,</v>

273
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>unless you got some tall motherfuckers and your family.</v>

274
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of Mexicans out there but is easily made it as a four maybe.</v>

275
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you think maybe it's do with that.</v>

276
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more than just being an athlete.</v>

277
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's an athlete and a football.</v>

278
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have some serious skills and serious magic.</v>

279
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>He could've just been a really strong athletic guy.</v>

280
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Look at Matt Mitch Realm and strong and athletic match material is a fucking</v>

281
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.254
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

284
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that if those guys came over to the UFC,</v>

285
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.690

291
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that are playing football right now.</v>

292
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've sat,</v>

293
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

294
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a,</v>

295
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is,</v>

296
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>he's a super athlete and there's,</v>

297
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>there's dudes that are super athletes that are in maybe other sports and we're</v>

298
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>starting to see in the UFC.</v>

299
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big topic of discussion.</v>

300
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

301
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>how much of a difference does like serious athleticism make?</v>

302
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>It makes a huge,</v>

303
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones has been a fucking doing,</v>

304
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing mixed martial arts for only three years.</v>

305
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Before that he was a wrestler.</v>

306
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's incredible.</v>

307
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>

308
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.751
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

309
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's already happened in boxing.</v>

310
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Just look at what happened with boxing culturally look what happened.</v>

311
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though that football and it's,</v>

312
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just where the money is that the,</v>

313
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the high money ones like football and basketball,</v>

314
00:08:57.021 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>they get the best athletes.</v>

315
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

316
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though the UFC has been around now for,</v>

317
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:01.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>since [inaudible] 93 it's not been like a real accepted,</v>

319
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>a mainstream thing,</v>

321
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>but for like the last five or six years,</v>

322
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

323
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>when you say yes,</v>

324
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.161
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

325
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

326
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.790
<v Speaker 1>it's the super athletes that start Jujitsu early wrestling their whole lives and</v>

327
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.021
<v Speaker 1>striking early.</v>

328
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>They put it together like the roof old brothers.</v>

329
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

330
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the best athletes that start off like the raw Ruffo brothers,</v>

331
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

332
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

333
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.031
<v Speaker 1>it's some,</v>

334
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:32.031
<v Speaker 1>some people can start off with Jujitsu and wrestling and striking early and</v>

335
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>achieve so much physically from it,</v>

336
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>but still they weren't born with the athleticism.</v>

337
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.571
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

338
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be a natural.</v>

339
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's got to all come together.</v>

340
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have all the pieces together to make it in the big sports that we</v>

341
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>see today.</v>

342
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And they're like foot.</v>

343
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You can't start,</v>

344
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 1>start playing football when you're 22 and make the NFL.</v>

345
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>If you do that.</v>

346
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It may have happened once or twice.</v>

347
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Some African Guy,</v>

348
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

349
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It may have happened.</v>

350
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

351
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

353

354
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>one of them [inaudible] guys that started playing basketball for 18 months and</v>

355

358
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.860

359
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>look at what's going on with all the sports.</v>

360
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>They just go and find that dude and say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but one of those dudes I'm sure started playing basketball late.</v>

370
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.350

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

398
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:14.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

399
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:15.900
<v Speaker 1>they would also worry,</v>

400
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I think evolutionarily about that.</v>

401
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Is this real,</v>

402
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 1>is that a real word?</v>

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

404
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>about the baby getting too big inside of them and get stuck coming out of their</v>

405
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>poster and just blow it all out.</v>

406
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a seven foot three dude,</v>

407
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 1>imagine how big is fucking babies are.</v>

408
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>If it's half his baby,</v>

409
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you know you got a 1520 pound baby inside your hooker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

411
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I will say this though,</v>

412
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not attracted to zoo work that I'm not a talk track that a real tall checks,</v>

413
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:40.434

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:40.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and especially when they get fucking ridiculous.</v>

416
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>If a girl is six foot one,</v>

417
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>usually they gotta be,</v>

418
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>they gotta have really pretty faces and that's usually their bodies start to get</v>

419
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>out of whack.</v>

420
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.051
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

421
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:52.870
<v Speaker 1>It just like,</v>

422
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but I have looked at big tall ass checks and when you see them in public,</v>

423
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts we'll race through my mind.</v>

424
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.414
<v Speaker 1>Like damn,</v>

425
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that'd be nice just to pump a load into her and see what my baby would see,</v>

426
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>what my boy would turn out like,</v>

00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

428
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>How proud would I be up that fucking kid?</v>

429
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.053

431
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And you imagine he's six foot five and that's my son and he's eating ass Todd</v>

445
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 1>a child,</v>

453
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.140
<v Speaker 1>make great babies for him.</v>

454
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So he found her and he described like,</v>

455
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.180
<v Speaker 1>look what he did,</v>

459
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>boy and he had some method and then Zulu came out.</v>

520
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:26.051
<v Speaker 1>Hixon Gracie,</v>

521
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 1>he was like 18 I think he was a representative of Jujitsu,</v>

522
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>fought this shy,</v>

523
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's super athlete,</v>

524
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>black dude named Zulu.</v>

525
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.110

<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

527
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>just slamming them and Hixon eventually gets his back and strangle them and it's</v>

528
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>one of those all time great videos where people watch it like Jujitsu Gardens.</v>

529
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day it was like,</v>

538
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 3>a big fucking deal and the footage is so bad but it looks cool.</v>

539
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like 50th generation.</v>

540
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.370
<v Speaker 1>All that footage.</v>

542
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it got the DVD and then a copy and it already started off as terrible</v>

543
00:15:08.561 --> 00:15:09.220
<v Speaker 1>footage.</v>

544

<v Speaker 1>Now it's like like silhouetted kind of.</v>

545
00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a yellow and black and orange type thing,</v>

546
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.903
<v Speaker 1>but it classes.</v>

547
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the coolest things that I ever got at a being famous was I got to have</v>

548
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:20.670
<v Speaker 3>dinner with Hixson.</v>

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I had dinner with Hickson and then we went over his house and we watched fights</v>

553
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.550
<v Speaker 3>and he broke down what dudes were doing wrong.</v>

554
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.020
<v Speaker 3>He was watching Mario Sperry fight and coliseum and he was just talking about</v>

555
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:34.561
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:43.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

564
00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:46.110
<v Speaker 3>like his philosophy on Jujutsu very simple.</v>

565
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.940
<v Speaker 3>We started zero and from zero we're going to one and we're not going back to</v>

566
00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:51.774
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>

567
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.160
<v Speaker 3>And then from one we're going to two from two to three to checkmate,</v>

568
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.990
<v Speaker 3>that's where we're going to go.</v>

569
00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.100

612
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I think Marcella Garcia is the number one guy that's ever lived,</v>

626
00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:27.150
<v Speaker 3>to calm and control himself.</v>

627
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Hixon Gracie slapping them in the face.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I would freak out</v>

632
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.220
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

633
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:32.520
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

634
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.150
<v Speaker 1>if like me and Hickson would,</v>

636
00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there talking to Jujitsu.</v>

637
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not out of the question.</v>

638
00:17:40.021 --> 00:17:42.210
<v Speaker 1>That might happen in the future for sure.</v>

639
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.781
<v Speaker 1>It might.</v>

640
00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It might not.</v>

641
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.363
<v Speaker 1>I would love it.</v>

642
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

643
00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.210
<v Speaker 1>that would be a fucking dream of mine to hang out and talk to you Jitsu and</v>

644
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>break shit to the core of the people who don't know the history.</v>

645
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo tapped Hickson's brother boiler and a Abu Dhabi 2003,</v>

646
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's a giant upset when Eddie was a brown belt and he caught him with a</v>

647
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 1>triangle.</v>

648
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.683
<v Speaker 1>So there's like,</v>

649
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>is it perceived animosity sometimes because of that,</v>

650
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing exists.</v>

651
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>You've never been anything but respectful of any of those guys.</v>

652
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:11.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

653
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.564
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

654
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.643
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

655
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I know that there were trying to do some sort of a rematch with you and Heuler,</v>

656
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.753
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

657
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

658
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was badly or going to happen is a promoter called or emailed me</v>

659
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 1>last October,</v>

660
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

661
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>October or November.</v>

662
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And it was a guy that I've done privates for.</v>

663
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:31.584
<v Speaker 1>I know who is,</v>

664
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

665
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 1>he's really high up in Jujitsu in the Middle East in Abu Dhabi and um,</v>

666
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>they're putting together,</v>

667
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>they were putting together a Nogi world championship in Abu Dhabi.</v>

668
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>They never had a Nogi one.</v>

669
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>They're doing geeky world championships out there,</v>

670
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but the Nogi ones,</v>

671
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to have one in April.</v>

672
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And they asked me if,</v>

673
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.810
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to have me and Heuler as a supermatch,</v>

674
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but they never contacted him.</v>

675
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 1>They told him,</v>

676
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

677
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Then I emailed him back and I'm like,</v>

678
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.111
<v Speaker 1>you know me,</v>

679
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm down to rematch boiler anytime.</v>

680
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I've always been down.</v>

681
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I've never been the one denying it.</v>

682
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I want one more match.</v>

683
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to try it.</v>
