<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience and I,</v>

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to be because I tried,</v>

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>we eat yeah.</v>

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Once two years ago and I stayed hide for 14 days straight to God,</v>

6
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.091
<v Speaker 1>Did you eat it?</v>

8
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:18.661
<v Speaker 1>14 days.</v>

9
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>900 he smoked.</v>

10
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a vaporizer.</v>

11
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

12
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

13
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Vaporize vaporizer.</v>

14
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And I say hi for 14 days and I thought it doesn't right.</v>

16
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

17
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.461
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't high.</v>

18
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

19
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.033
<v Speaker 1>Well hopefully it wasn't,</v>

20
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was like disconnected from reality.</v>

21
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes that does happen and I know a story about a guy who is a straight</v>

22
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>laced guy who took some marijuana edible so that he could get to sleep and he</v>

23
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>had a real problem.</v>

24
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he got suicidal and freaked out and became just irrationally anxious.</v>

25
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>He had crippling anxiety and some time for some time for weeks.</v>

26
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And he's a confident guy and a very handsome,</v>

27
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>big muscular guy.</v>

28
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Like he just like,</v>

29
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you would never imagine this guy have any antianxiety.</v>

30
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I think some people have just the chemistry of different individuals.</v>

31
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't bar for death and that's what the doctor told me because I went to the</v>

32
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:14.694
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist.</v>

33
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.631
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

34
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:16.464
<v Speaker 1>you went to this like</v>

35
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

36
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead week.</v>

37
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That week I went to the psych guy through smell and I told him no,</v>

38
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I smoked that thing like 14 days ago and I still high.</v>

39
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

40
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>he looked at me and he gave me some,</v>

41
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>some cycle one.</v>

42
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He gave me some pills and I was like,</v>

43
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

44
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>if you stay high until tomorrow,</v>

45
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>take these pills.</v>

46
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Because what he told me,</v>

47
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:46.041
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I didn't know that he can be a trigger if you're has some</v>

48
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:51.051
<v Speaker 1>tennis of schizophrenia and a psychopath or if you feel have,</v>

49
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>which was not my case.</v>

50
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>And He's told this is very rare,</v>

51
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but he can't happen,</v>

52
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>which is not your case.</v>

53
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:56.841
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

54
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.841
<v Speaker 1>it was happy because of the up and the next day I was okay and I felt okay and I</v>

55
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>did it took the pills and it was crazy,</v>

56
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.793
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

57
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.451
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

58
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that I decided to record it,</v>

59
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

60
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

61
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

62
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

63
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>let me record what I'm thinking.</v>

64
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>At least let's get some good experience out of it.</v>

65
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that it started to record and I said,</v>

66
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to record everything that I'm thinking.</v>

68
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And when I look at the cell phone,</v>

69
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>it was 45 minutes,</v>

70
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes to talk.</v>

71
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even realize I just said that I'm going to record now.</v>

72
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And there was 45 minutes and when I listened to like 15 days after that,</v>

73
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

74
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm so crazy.</v>

75
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.244
<v Speaker 1>I'm so crazy.</v>

76
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.993
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

77
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

78
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to understand on my son's talking,</v>

79
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>talking to me right now.</v>

80
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

81
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>That was one hit of available.</v>

82
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

83
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it was more than one.</v>

84
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of hits.</v>

85
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>He was a bunch.</v>

86
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

87
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you're too tall.</v>

88
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.091
<v Speaker 1>You're big.</v>

89
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>You're like a 250 pounds.</v>

90
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>So fucking use it a lot.</v>

91
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

92
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>so they were saying keep hitting it because you're tall.</v>

93
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Because I wasn't feeling it.</v>

94
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

95
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 2>But when I felt it,</v>

96
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I felt for 14 and you know,</v>

97
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>having that belief does,</v>

98
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>does add up to that.</v>

99
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's step one in my opinion is visualize a nam believing it and on the</v>

100
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>flip side,</v>

101
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 2>having a negative self worth or a negative opinion of what you're about to do or</v>

102
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>a negative thought about the future can also manifest all sorts of terrible</v>

103
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

104
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.491
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

105
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

106
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Gotta think placebo effect is a real thing.</v>

107
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:25.301
<v Speaker 2>We know that,</v>

108
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:25.601
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

109
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>We know that if you really do believe that you're going to get better because of</v>

110
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>some sugar pill they give you,</v>

111
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a tangible result,</v>

112
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>100% if you really believe that salt guy,</v>

113
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>if the thing about all that stupid shit is,</v>

114
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 2>if you believe it,</v>

115
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it actually has an effect.</v>

116
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

117
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of healers out there that at least on paper are totally full of</v>

118
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

119
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe in these assholes,</v>

120
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

121
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I can make a difference.</v>

122
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>It's very slippery.</v>

123
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 2>The human mind is such a slippery thing.</v>

124
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

125
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>and I'll go back to my own experience and again,</v>

126
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how a femoral are out there you want to get,</v>

127
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>but I'm out there in Antarctica 54 days alone.</v>

128
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm telling you I'm doing this for this bigger purpose.</v>

129
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm feel like I'm tapped into that and like legitimately there were moments,</v>

130
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.221
<v Speaker 2>at least for me,</v>

131
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 2>whether I'm manifesting that in my mind,</v>

132
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

133
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>that I am actually feeling energetically uplifted by the people pushing me on.</v>

134
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Like there were days that were incredibly hard where I would sit there and I'd</v>

135
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

136
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.571
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

137
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can do this and I'm done.</v>

138
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:24.551
<v Speaker 2>Like boom.</v>

139
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Like I would get over,</v>

140
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I would hit with this sort of larger purpose,</v>

141
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>that's larger outcome and again,</v>

142
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not,</v>

143
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a super religious person.</v>

144
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I was actually raised on a hippie commune.</v>

145
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Like I come from a pretty untraditional background,</v>

146
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 2>but like the energetic field,</v>

147
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call that or if that's just the belief in something,</v>

148
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 2>the power of that.</v>

150
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt the strength from those moments.</v>

151
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>There was moments when my body's switched from kind of being negative.</v>

152
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.141
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

153
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 2>another hard day out here.</v>

154
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

155
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 2>it's minus 25 to tapping into those flow states.</v>

156
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

157
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

158
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't have perfect words for that.</v>

159
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

160
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to try to build my vocabulary around that.</v>

162
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>But that energy,</v>

163
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it was derived from what you're saying.</v>

164
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 2>If you start to believe it,</v>

165
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>if you can believe like,</v>

166
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:01.901
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

167
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a larger purpose in this,</v>

168
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:03.431
<v Speaker 2>or hey,</v>

169
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 2>this blue force fields A's and one foot,</v>

170
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>there is something that if you can originate that positivity in your mind that I</v>

171
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 2>think can give us incredible amounts of strength,</v>

172
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

173
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.491
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

174
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>and then we can tap into something greater.</v>

175
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine being this guy getting medals and awards for helping create jobs</v>

176
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>around the country and then realizing that automation is coming like a tidal</v>

177
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 2>wave and that your efforts that you're getting applauded for really not going to</v>

178
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.304
<v Speaker 2>do the trick.</v>

179
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And then Donald Trump wins the election in 2016 and for whatever reason,</v>

180
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.561
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

181
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the media is just not being honest about all the economic drivers.</v>

182
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 2>They're blaming racism,</v>

183
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Russia base book,</v>

184
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>the FBI.</v>

185
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the voter district data on a district by district basis,</v>

186
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in that</v>

187
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 2>voting district and the movement towards Trump.</v>

188
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a straight economic story where we blasted away 4 million jobs in the</v>

189
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>swing states and Donald Trump is our president.</v>

190
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 2>So imagine being me and then seeing that and being like,</v>

191
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.044
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

192
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

193
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 2>This is an economic,</v>

194
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>technological story.</v>

195
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to people in Washington DC.</v>

196
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.621
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

197
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.011
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

198
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>

199
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 2>We're in the third inning of the greatest economic and technological</v>

200
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>transformation in the history of our country.</v>

201
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>And the third inning has brought us Donald Trump.</v>

202
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.611
<v Speaker 2>The fourth,</v>

203
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:22.911
<v Speaker 2>fifth,</v>

204
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>sixth endings are going to be horrific.</v>

205
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

206
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 2>And then the answers I got were somewhere between disappointing and horrifying,</v>

207
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>where if you go to mainstream politicians and you're like,</v>

208
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.634
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>

209
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>The answers I got were literally number one.</v>

210
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>We cannot talk about that.</v>

211
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.461
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

212
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 2>we should study that.</v>

213
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.020
<v Speaker 2>We cannot talk about that.</v>

214
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:43.251
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

215
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 2>that's verbatim really.</v>

216
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And why were they saying that?</v>

218
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems alarmists like anti progress or like,</v>

219
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:51.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.551
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

221
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

222
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 2>throwing stones at like,</v>

224
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 2>like big tech companies and it's like,</v>

225
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not throwing stones at anyone.</v>

226
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pointing out the fact.</v>

227
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>So number one is,</v>

228
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

229
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>so number one was can't talk about it.</v>

230
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Number two was need to study it.</v>

231
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 2>And the number three was the point you made a originally,</v>

232
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 2>which was we must educate and retrain Americans for the jobs of the future.</v>

233
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was like,</v>

234
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:12.411
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

235
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 2>we're terrible at that by the numbers,</v>

236
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>then they'd literally be like,</v>

237
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:16.581
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

238
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess we'll learn to get better at it then.</v>

239
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>

240
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 2>so I came back to my home in New York City and I was like,</v>

241
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:22.694
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

242
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 2>we are so backward and far gone as a,</v>

243
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 2>certainly as a government.</v>

244
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

245
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>and so then I was grappling with it and I'm a parent like you are.</v>

246
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at my kids and I was like,</v>

247
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 2>am I really going to bring them up in this shit show?</v>

248
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

249
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.990
<v Speaker 2>is this really the,</v>

250
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>is this really the plan?</v>

251
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And so then I was like,</v>

252
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

253
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 2>how would you actually solve this problem if you,</v>

254
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 2>if you had to do so?</v>

255
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 2>And so then I said,</v>

256
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.304
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

257
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income,</v>

258
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 2>rebranded the freedom dividend after we did a bunch of tests because it tests</v>

259
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 2>much better as the freedom dividend and universal basic income and,</v>

260
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 2>and then try and make the,</v>

261
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the rules of the economy work better for more people as fast as we can before</v>

262
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:03.670
<v Speaker 2>this automation wave really crescendo.</v>

263
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

264
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

265
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

266
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.173
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

267
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

268
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 3>and then Alzheimer's,</v>

269
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

270
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.493
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

271
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:10.861
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

272
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I know you're plus a plus 50,</v>

273
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:13.921
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

274
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 3>cheeks see Saint Jo has alzheimers.</v>

275
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 3>I know that he wants to keep doing this podcast for forever.</v>

276
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 3>That'd be excused to stuff.</v>

277
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.513
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

278
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 3>so THC has been shown to inhibit the formation of Beta amyloid plaques.</v>

279
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

280
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

281
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:31.710
<v Speaker 3>the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.</v>

282
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 3>And then CBD CBD has also been shown to be effective for um,</v>

283
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 3>for Alzheimer's disease as well.</v>

284
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 3>It was a rat study that was going to,</v>

285
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

286
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.311
<v Speaker 3>get into,</v>

287
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's fairly fairly,</v>

288
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.830
<v Speaker 3>it's fairly detailed.</v>

289
00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:44.431
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

290
00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:46.140
<v Speaker 3>it might be best just to say that it can,</v>

291
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

292
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>help with rescue memory in patients if you do use CBD meaning and that it may</v>

293
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 3>actually reverse and that's been shown before to,</v>

294
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 3>they've done that in mice.</v>

295
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I got to interrupt you for one second.</v>

296
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

297
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 3>And I think you would agree this data is,</v>

298
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.033
<v Speaker 3>some of it's,</v>

299
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 3>some of it sort of epidemiological,</v>

300
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 3>some of it's preclinical,</v>

301
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

302
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 3>very early.</v>

303
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:12.591
<v Speaker 3>None of it really proves game and just let me say I'm a clinician.</v>

304
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

305
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 3>If someone comes to me and they have a concussion,</v>

306
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>it's very frustrating just to say to them,</v>

307
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.331
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

308
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:18.901
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

309
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.501
<v Speaker 3>cognitive,</v>

310
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 3>rest,</v>

311
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 3>go home.</v>

312
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:20.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

313
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 3>It's really frustrating to say that to someone also to,</v>

314
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:23.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

315
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.391
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

316
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 3>the high fat diet thing.</v>

317
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

318
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Joe and I both fall,</v>

319
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:27.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:27.721
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

321
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 3>very similar die.</v>

322
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 3>So that's something I wanted to share with regards to,</v>

323
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

324
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

325
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 3>the Alzheimer's disease,</v>

326
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 3>we have really,</v>

327
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 3>really poor medications for that and we have an aging population.</v>

328
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:39.684
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

329
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.291
<v Speaker 3>like Alex,</v>

330
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 3>like you want to look at everything,</v>

331
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 3>which is what I'm doing.</v>

332
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm looking at everything and I'm trying to make a clinical decision.</v>

333
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Am I using some things like without,</v>

334
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

335
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 3>randomized control trials?</v>

336
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Of course I am.</v>

337
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

338
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm a clinician so I'm using,</v>

339
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

340
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms of action.</v>

341
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm using what I've see and clinic and I'm using epidemiological studies and I'm</v>

342
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 3>also taking into account what other medicines do I have your base upon all the</v>

343
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:03.790
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>

344
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 3>This seems to be an effective treatment and I am absolutely not saying that you</v>

345
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 3>as a clinician shouldn't do that.</v>

346
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Especially you're in Canada at t cannabis is legal.</v>

347
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 3>You should,</v>

348
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 3>you should use your best judgment.</v>

349
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that when we're talking about policy decisions around</v>

350
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and Thc,</v>

351
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 3>and to a much lesser extent,</v>

352
00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:22.414
<v Speaker 3>CBD,</v>

353
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 3>the advocacy groups have seized on this very,</v>

354
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 3>very preliminary data to to say a lot of things about cannabis and THC that have</v>

355
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 3>not been proven.</v>

356
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.221
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

357
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 3>a guy I know named Peter Bock,</v>

358
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 3>who very smart,</v>

359
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

360
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 3>he's a pulmonologist,</v>

361
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 3>is at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and he wrote a piece in the Wall</v>

362
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:40.801
<v Speaker 3>Street Journal,</v>

363
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.410
<v Speaker 3>a few,</v>

364
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

365
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago talking about cannabis is limits as medicine.</v>

366
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And he said something that I thought it was so well put,</v>

367
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:53.121
<v Speaker 3>which is the reason why people want cannabis to work for Alzheimer's and cancer</v>

368
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.121
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of things.</v>

369
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Where does,</v>

370
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 3>where there's really no evidence that it works is that we don't have good</v>

371
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.404
<v Speaker 3>treatments.</v>

372
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 3>We want cures.</v>

373
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 3>We want help.</v>

374
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:01.891
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

375
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 3>if we're clinicians,</v>

376
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

377
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:03.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a clinician.</v>

378
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 3>You're a clinician.</v>

379
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Want to be able to give people who come into our offices something.</v>

380
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 3>But that hope is not a substitute for science.</v>

381
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that it works.</v>

382
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 3>And even you want,</v>

383
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 3>you want your patients to have hope.</v>

384
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

385
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 3>But the advocates,</v>

386
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>

387
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 3>we're using this to push,</v>

388
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 3>especially to push THC and to capitalize on the public confusion around THC and</v>

389
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 3>CBD.</v>

390
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a real,</v>

391
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.200
<v Speaker 3>it's a real</v>

392
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.250
<v Speaker 4>disservice to people.</v>

393
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.983
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

394
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

395
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

396
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

397
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 4>I think we covered everything.</v>

398
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 4>So it's a complicated subject.</v>

399
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.743
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

400
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 4>And a,</v>

401
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.410
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really important to discuss how complicated it is.</v>

402
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

403
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a,</v>

404
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard such a detailed analysis of all this stuff in,</v>

405
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.130
<v Speaker 4>in a way where you can get two opposing people that are,</v>

406
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

407
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:52.540
<v Speaker 4>very civil about it,</v>

408
00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 4>but agree on certain aspects of it.</v>

409
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

410
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I think we really highlighted all those things.</v>
