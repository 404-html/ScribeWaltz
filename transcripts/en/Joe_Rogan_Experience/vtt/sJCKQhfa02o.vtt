117
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Like when I got it,</v>

118
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I was playing pool in San Francisco Cause Thursday night,</v>

121
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>six 30 in the morning and then drove it and I was exhausted and I just jacked my</v>

122
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>the flag flying.</v>

126
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>The CI is down.</v>

127
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>That's when the fucking flu goes right to the news and boom,</v>

128
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.621
<v Speaker 1>once it grabs you,</v>

129
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:14.321
<v Speaker 1>you would look at,</v>

130
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.041
<v Speaker 1>grab your bro.</v>

131
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong flu.</v>

132
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Well you're telling me is by the time you got on the plane,</v>

133
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:19.301
<v Speaker 1>you are really getting,</v>

134
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the children should had just strong.</v>

135
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking flu.</v>

136
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>What is it going on in the plane?</v>

137
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the recycled air is just terrible for you?</v>

138
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the APP altitude.</v>

139
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that terrible for you too?</v>

140
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 3>And my attitude,</v>

141
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I heard CCI,</v>

142
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.391
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about that.</v>

143
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:33.021
<v Speaker 3>I think there's probably a bit,</v>

144
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I heard that the recycled air and the plane and it's actually really good like</v>

145
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.860
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

146
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a really good air since you moved that for my Ann Coulter.</v>

147
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

148
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

149
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.770
<v Speaker 3>they did like a dateline thing about it and I think they actually talked to the</v>

150
00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 3>people that design the air systems and planes and they said that no,</v>

151
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 3>they're really good.</v>

152
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:47.780
<v Speaker 3>They're filtered really well.</v>

153
00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:48.710
<v Speaker 3>So what's the problem?</v>

154
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it has to be an altitude.</v>

155
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Just just the flu marinated in you,</v>

156
00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:52.611
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

157
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

158
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.783
<v Speaker 3>but the fluid,</v>

159
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.441
<v Speaker 3>the flu,</v>

160
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Marin Ellison,</v>

161
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>we've been getting fluids once a year,</v>

163
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:58.444
<v Speaker 1>especially the case.</v>

164
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 1>We're over 40 years.</v>

165
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten one in a couple of years.</v>

166
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been real good about blue gets stronger these days is a strange,</v>

167
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:05.814
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what they call it?</v>

168
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.481
<v Speaker 1>A flu.</v>

169
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:07.610
<v Speaker 1>A fucking getting stronger.</v>

170
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Know that are they all come from farm animals?</v>

171
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.753
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

172
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of them come from domesticated animals.</v>

173
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>They come from pigs and chickens and birds and you know,</v>

174
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that's why when they said this is the bird flu and it was like,</v>

175
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:19.651
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

176
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:20.370
<v Speaker 1>the bird flu.</v>

177
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Well they're kind of all bird flus or pig flu is a swine flu.</v>

178
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:23.841
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

179
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:25.290
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking livestock diseases.</v>

180
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:26.124
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times,</v>

181
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:26.881
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

183
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>we're probably making these fucking things by forcing all these animals to live</v>

184
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Speaker 1>in shit.</v>

185
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

186
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>and be on top of each other.</v>

188
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>That's probably where these things come from.</v>

189
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:34.914
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

191
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>But when you start telling me that a lot of fluids or livestock diseases and you</v>

192
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:38.431
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

193
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck we do to livestock,</v>

194
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some sort of a connection.</v>

195
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

196
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>the livestock industry should be responsible for all those deaths,</v>

198
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>if that can be proven.</v>

199
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>But if it's possible to prove that they're the reason why the flu exists,</v>

200
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>but then again you need pork chops.</v>

201
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.723
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck</v>

202
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 3>did you see that the pyramid shit where they took a robot through that?</v>

203
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.470
<v Speaker 3>That did,</v>

204
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

205
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 3>They saw some writing that had been unseen for at least 4,000 years I think.</v>

206
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:04.551
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

208
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 3>It was like red and we're going to figure it out.</v>

209
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I can even see by this pictures I was</v>

210
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>in Boston and while I was there when I started feeling better,</v>

211
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>which the museum and went to the Museum of fine arts and they had all these</v>

212
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.961
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian art and it was all like ancient ancient shit like 2000 BC,</v>

213
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you know all the way up to like Cleopatra's era,</v>

214
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>which is like the later errors.</v>

215
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.820
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fascinating stuff man.</v>

216
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.470
<v Speaker 1>You know when you really get into Egypt,</v>

217
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>how weird they are in comparison to us.</v>

218
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when you just look at like what they did,</v>

219
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.470
<v Speaker 1>they had is like super advanced culture that was completely different than ours.</v>

220
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Like so completely different that their writings was all image based.</v>

221
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Instead of like having letters,</v>

222
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:48.021
<v Speaker 1>they had like images that represents symbols and so all the writing is their</v>

223
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 1>conceptual.</v>

224
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Like the way they looked at the world was completely different than the way we</v>

225
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

226
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>The way we look at things with our writing and our language,</v>

227
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>our our western</v>

228
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of morals and values and what's important,</v>

229
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.594
<v Speaker 4>what's not important.</v>

230
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 4>This is just something we sort of settled on and what you see with the ancient</v>

231
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Egyptians as well here was this really advanced culture that was incapable of</v>

232
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.761
<v Speaker 4>these incredible architectural masterpieces that we're puzzled by today.</v>

233
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Like they'll tell you that.</v>

234
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 4>They know how they built the pyramids all we figured it out.</v>

235
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.940
<v Speaker 4>It is a such a staggering accomplishment that these people,</v>

236
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:30.131
<v Speaker 4>2,500 BC built these immense perfect stone structures.</v>

237
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're fucking big.</v>

238
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.461
<v Speaker 4>2 million,</v>

239
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.461
<v Speaker 4>300,000 stones the way between two and 80 tons and some of them were cut from a</v>

240
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 4>quarry that was 500 fucking miles away.</v>

241
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean these people were bad,</v>

242
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 4>bad mother fuckers.</v>

243
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.990
<v Speaker 4>They were doing some shit that none of us in this room could ever fucking figure</v>

244
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:49.410
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>

245
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 4>It was complex mathematics to cause you had to have every stone cut perfectly by</v>

246
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 4>the time you got to the top because any little room for error,</v>

247
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 4>you're shit would be cockeyed.</v>

248
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 4>You're 2 million,</v>

249
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 4>300,000 stones in the Great Pyramid.</v>

250
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 4>Think about how perfect you have to be the entire way and adjust all the way.</v>

251
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 4>And now it's not like those stones are like this smaller one side and huge on</v>

252
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 4>the other and it's all,</v>

253
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 4>they tried to balance it out the end.</v>

254
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

255
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

256
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.421
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

257
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:14.481
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

258
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

259
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 4>The shit is perfect.</v>

260
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 4>And 2,500,000 years ago,</v>

261
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.641
<v Speaker 4>and it used to be,</v>

262
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.474
<v Speaker 4>we look at it now,</v>

263
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 4>it's all fucked up.</v>

264
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 4>And crumply that's cause they,</v>

265
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 4>they rated it,</v>

266
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 4>it was covered in smooth limestone.</v>

267
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 4>They must have been so fucking beautiful.</v>

268
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 4>But when they built Cairo,</v>

269
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 4>they stole all the limestone from the pyramids.</v>

270
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 4>Those little eight monkey people just chipped away at what their great,</v>

271
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 4>great ancestors had created.</v>

272
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 4>You know these people that are living today on her fucking stupid cars and all</v>

273
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 4>the ridiculous way that we look at the world,</v>

274
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 4>these crazy fucking people.</v>

275
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have electricity.</v>

276
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have any leadership roles?</v>

277
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

278
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 4>not copper tube.</v>

279
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 4>All they can probe when you don't see that monotherapy drink a five hour fucking</v>

280
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 4>energy like us.</v>

281
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything mobile?</v>

282
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.331
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>

283
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything that makes you respect a dude less than when he gets into a</v>

284
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 4>Twitter world with his girlfriend online?</v>

285
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst.</v>

286
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know.</v>

287
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:09.861
<v Speaker 4>Why.</v>

288
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen one recently?</v>

289
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.481
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

290
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 4>I seen a ton of them.</v>

291
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 4>I seen people arguing with their spouses on Twitter.</v>

292
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Jenna Jameson and Tito Ortiz do it.</v>

293
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 4>They do like public,</v>

294
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 4>like really public important shit.</v>

295
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Get arrested for fucking Twitter.</v>

296
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Let me say they do it,</v>

297
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 4>but that's like a publicity thing.</v>

298
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe because there there's,</v>

299
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.863
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe,</v>

300
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're savvy.</v>

301
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's celebrity savvy and you know,</v>

302
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 4>they had to keep her name out there.</v>

303
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean that there's,</v>

304
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.891
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

305
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 4>you could come up with a rational for a famous person doing it.</v>

306
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 4>I guess if you're one of those famous people that want to be on a reality show,</v>

307
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 4>you know I can,</v>

308
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 4>I can understand,</v>

309
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but I know due to our regular dudes who are having like Twitter wars with the</v>

310
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend online with the girlfriend will say it would be amazing if I had a</v>

311
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 4>man in my life that actually cared about what I think and then you know the guy</v>

312
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 4>will come back on.</v>

313
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.900
<v Speaker 4>It would be amazing.</v>

314
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 1>That'd be smacking.</v>

315
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Getting that Dick suck carrying rocks.</v>

316
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.300

318
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.780

319
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Cock think I'll beat these fucking what the fuck does it?</v>

320
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.100

321
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

322
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>

323
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>We're really part of the AAD society.</v>

324
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>What is it going to take?</v>

325
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>When are people going to talk about us?</v>

326
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Like that was BC,</v>

327
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.890
<v Speaker 1>there was aid d then what's going to happen post nuclear?</v>

328
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's posted to not be posted on.</v>

329
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this the other day,</v>

330
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.811
<v Speaker 1>how interesting and not that some day we're going to be what BC is to us post</v>

331
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>nuclear makes sense that they would one day he said,</v>

332
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

333
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I would think that makes sense.</v>

334
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Then one day they would just say,</v>

335
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.251
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

336

<v Speaker 1>what do you want to be?</v>

345
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 1>How do you want to be defined?</v>

346
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>How fucking crazy is that?</v>

347
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>That someday we're going to be part of a di.</v>

348
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.091
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>

349
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be something like that.</v>

350
00:09:58.161 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

351
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:09:59.461 --> 00:09:59.601
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

353
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 1>same way BC,</v>

354
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine thinking about BC.</v>

355
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Why don't think it'd be silly.</v>

356
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I think of people with sandals were beads,</v>

357
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:10.210
<v Speaker 1>smoking fucking trees looked at a d stand for after death.</v>

359
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.480
<v Speaker 1>The Christ dying.</v>

360
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think so.</v>

361
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>

362
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually a term for something that it's been sort of accepted along</v>

363
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:19.354
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

364
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.220

<v Speaker 1>Henry Winkler twittered me or did you work with him on the movie?</v>

368
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.920
<v Speaker 1>That was so amazing.</v>

369
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:27.161

00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>He's like only following like 50 people.</v>

373
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.601
<v Speaker 1>One was me.</v>

378

<v Speaker 1>podcast</v>

379
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>guys who know you guys who often move on.</v>

380
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Henry Henry Winkler is cool as fuck.</v>

381
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:46.564
<v Speaker 1>Who was loves.</v>

382
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.860
<v Speaker 1>He loves fly fishing.</v>

383
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.510
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about fly fishing.</v>

384
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Someone took him fly fish and I think in the late eighties or early nineties and</v>

385
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:54.010
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book called,</v>

386
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I never met an idiot on the river.</v>

387
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.380
<v Speaker 1>All about the cool people that he met fly fishing and he has all these photos</v>

388
00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and the books a places he's gone fly fishing.</v>

389
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.340
<v Speaker 1>That's bad ass fishing is fun as fuck man.</v>

390
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.450
<v Speaker 1>When I was living in Boulder,</v>

391
00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:07.750
<v Speaker 1>there was a company that would take you out and I was totally down to go.</v>

392
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I just never had the time before.</v>

393
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.473
<v Speaker 1>We had to move back.</v>

394
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.110
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

395
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.943
<v Speaker 1>this dude,</v>

396
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.470
<v Speaker 1>there was one of those guys that will like make his own flies and shit.</v>

397
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.320
<v Speaker 1>They have like a station where they sell like feathers,</v>

398
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>little things and that's like that type of fishing is a completely different</v>

399
00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:22.444
<v Speaker 1>type of fishing.</v>

400
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:22.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

401
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's an art form to it.</v>

402
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>

403
00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Like the art of casting a fly Rod,</v>

404
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

405
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you can't be drunk and fucked up and yelling with your buddies.</v>

406
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You just dunk align in.</v>

407
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.300
<v Speaker 1>So like some of those guys get a little elitist.</v>

408
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Some of those fly Fisher guys,</v>

409
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.270
<v Speaker 1>they want to pretend that there's some,</v>

410
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 1>but there is something that's a little more intimate about it.</v>

411
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you make your own little lure,</v>

412
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you make your own little fake bug,</v>

413
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:46.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and they have all these different instructional video tapes on how to make</v>

415
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:50.950
<v Speaker 1>lures.</v>

416
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>You could find them online and dudes are like fashioning and a little feathers</v>

417
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:55.661
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

418
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's something crafty about that.</v>

419
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.800
<v Speaker 1>You cast it out or catch a big</v>

420
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Stephanie Lockhart does.</v>

421
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:01.371
<v Speaker 3>He's into all that.</v>

422
00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:04.700
<v Speaker 3>He just went fishing the other day at echo park or something like that.</v>

423
00:12:04.701 --> 00:12:05.451
<v Speaker 3>I didn't catch anything,</v>

424
00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:05.841
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

425
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:08.090
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy fishing it echo park really</v>

426
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.583
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>

427
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

428
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Silver Lake or the ocean STD of some sort of hole in a river or whatever the</v>

429
00:12:15.271 --> 00:12:17.940
<v Speaker 1>fuck it's gotta be so therapeutic for those people.</v>

430
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think I have the patients.</v>

431

<v Speaker 1>I've done it a thousand times.</v>

432
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.190

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not catching fish.</v>

434
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It can be such a drag.</v>

435
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been on fishing trips where it's like two days of nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

463
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:01.861
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pyle,</v>

464
00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:03.150
<v Speaker 1>when we were in Portland,</v>

465
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>he offered to take us out on his dad's pub,</v>

466
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:06.030
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't stay an extra day.</v>

467
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.020
<v Speaker 1>But that Portland supposed to have something awesome.</v>

468
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I just wish,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sometimes you watch the deadliest catch.</v>

00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:14.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a little much.</v>

472
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:14.904
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

473
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.481
<v Speaker 1>That's a little,</v>

474
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but those poor motherfuckers crab is not worth that much.</v>

475
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not that good.</v>

476

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's okay,</v>

477

00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it's worth a fuck load of money and it's out there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck ever.</v>

592
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if we were right now in some sort of a metal tube that is under the</v>

593
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking ocean a mile deep.</v>

594
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:23.870

<v Speaker 4>and what's the deepest and submarine goes?</v>

598
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.320
<v Speaker 4>We have to type it up cause I don't want to give you a full,</v>

599
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.550
<v Speaker 4>do you think it would be like if we didn't fly as much would think the same</v>

600
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:32.331
<v Speaker 4>thing about the flying.</v>

601
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Now you're in a metal tube</v>

602
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.450
<v Speaker 5>like way up in the sky.</v>

603
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 5>The wheel,</v>

604
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.840
<v Speaker 5>the fucking bread strip.</v>

605
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:41.080
<v Speaker 5>We would die because what's that shit goes into your mind like wait a sec.</v>

606
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.330

607
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 4>There's a leak.</v>

608
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.770
<v Speaker 4>We'll flop at the bard is in San Francisco.</v>

609
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 4>You know how I found out about,</v>

610
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about this on stage in San Francisco,</v>

611
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's a true story.</v>

612
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I was with fear factor.</v>

613
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:54.621
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>

614
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:56.940
<v Speaker 4>we were filming in Oakland and uh,</v>

615
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 4>everyone was going to get together,</v>

616
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 4>the crew and everybody was going to get together and have dinner in San</v>

617
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Francisco.</v>

618
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.930
<v Speaker 4>And I love those guys.</v>

619
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 4>They're there,</v>

620
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.340
<v Speaker 4>they're all fun guys.</v>

621
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm super comfortable with them.</v>

622
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 4>So I thought it would be way more fun to do this to get fucking barbecued.</v>

623
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.360
<v Speaker 4>So I eat this fucking cookie in my room and I am on pollute.</v>

624
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.194
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

625
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those cookies where he started having very mild hallucinations,</v>

626
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.600
<v Speaker 4>like trails,</v>

627
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 4>like there'll be trails when people are moving,</v>

628
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 4>you'll see like little bits of light following behind them and I'm starting to</v>

629
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 4>see things that aren't there necessarily like a,</v>

630
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

631
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.151
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

632
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.610
<v Speaker 4>I'll start to see like movement in front of people.</v>

633
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.211
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>

634
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was fucking gone man.</v>

635
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.770
<v Speaker 4>I was like way too high to be out in public.</v>

636
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:37.604
<v Speaker 4>I was having like,</v>

637
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I was having some sort of a membrane moment where I'm like on the brink of</v>

638
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:44.360
<v Speaker 4>passing through to some other dimension.</v>

639
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like right next to us,</v>

640
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 4>but we can't normally access pat fucking hot.</v>

641
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

642
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

643
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm way too.</v>

644
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden we're in this bar thing and my ears are popping and so</v>

645
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

646
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 4>why are my ears popping?</v>

647
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't my ears popping?</v>

648
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.391
<v Speaker 4>And whether you got,</v>

649
00:17:59.391 --> 00:17:59.611
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

650
00:17:59.611 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

651
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.500
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

652
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Or 500 feet of the ocean right now</v>

653
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 4>and all I could think of is what a dumb way to die and how scary that would be</v>

654
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 4>if that thing just started moving and it was a leak broke and then the water</v>

655
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:15.090
<v Speaker 4>comes rushing in.</v>

656
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.480
<v Speaker 4>What a nutty idea to put a fucking tube under the ocean in a place where the</v>

657
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:23.630
<v Speaker 4>ground is famous for movie half.</v>

658
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

659
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 4>How long has that been open?</v>

660
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 4>A long time.</v>

661
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a camp.</v>

662
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.771
<v Speaker 4>It's a come on.</v>

663

665
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Seven every time they get to the end.</v>

666
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

667
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.230

668
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 4>So same thing with this nuclear power plant.</v>

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

670

<v Speaker 4>They said it can.</v>

671
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 4>You can avoid up to an 8.2 I think we're going to be good while sudden they're</v>

672
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:41.514
<v Speaker 4>nine hits.</v>

673
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.623
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

676
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Is it good for a five is a good for a seven we're pretty sure it can survive as</v>

677
00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 4>seven would if it's a nine what if you're in there and it's one of those five</v>

678
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:57.681
<v Speaker 4>minute jammies where the whole fucking Dang is going for five minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>how long can this last?</v>

682
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 4>How much can it hold?</v>

683
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.520

685
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 4>anchored down to this moving ground.</v>

686
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Ocean is moving in a tsunami fashion over it as well because wherever the fuck</v>

687
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:27.141
<v Speaker 4>the epicenter of it that the shelf lifts up in a fucking giant 500 foot wall of</v>

688
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 4>water going 50,000 miles an hour.</v>

689
00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:31.340
<v Speaker 4>It's headed to the coast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think about it every day type thing like like the grocery store last night I</v>

711
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:11.280

717
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 4>were pussies compared to these people that live in like Alabama.</v>

718
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 4>These people in Joplin,</v>

719
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:22.981
<v Speaker 4>Missouri,</v>

720
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>where three quarters of the town just disappeared,</v>

721
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.530
<v Speaker 4>just disappeared.</v>

722
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

723
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:34.010
<v Speaker 4>They said that the tornado when it touched down was miles wide.</v>

724
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you not crazy.</v>

725
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:37.510
<v Speaker 4>That is miles.</v>

726
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Why Joey?</v>

727
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 4>So it literally is like a giant array,</v>

728
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:41.281
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

729
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 4>On a chalkboard just erasing giant swaths of land.</v>

730
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Feet Times nine common action.</v>

731
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.080
<v Speaker 3>We used to have a ton of tornadoes in Ohio.</v>

732
00:20:51.081 --> 00:20:52.310
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing I don't miss.</v>

733
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:52.910
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

734
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

735
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that?</v>

736
00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:54.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

737
00:20:54.771 --> 00:20:55.850
<v Speaker 3>we talked about how he got shit.</v>

738
00:20:55.851 --> 00:20:58.760
<v Speaker 3>We got chased once on the way home from an amusement park in a bus.</v>

739
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.330
<v Speaker 3>There was one chasing our bus and we were in high school or middle school or</v>

740
00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:03.050
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

741
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.960
<v Speaker 3>There was one in California though the other day lately.</v>

742
00:21:05.961 --> 00:21:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Rare Sacramento.</v>

743
00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:08.264
<v Speaker 3>Sacramento</v>

744
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.721
<v Speaker 4>for this.</v>

745
00:21:09.721 --> 00:21:10.381
<v Speaker 4>They had one.</v>

746
00:21:10.381 --> 00:21:11.400
<v Speaker 4>They reported in La,</v>

747
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.151
<v Speaker 4>not in la,</v>

748
00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:12.990
<v Speaker 4>but la area.</v>

749
00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Southern California.</v>

750
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:14.731
<v Speaker 4>It was recent,</v>

751
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:15.840
<v Speaker 4>like the last five,</v>

752
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.160
<v Speaker 4>six years or something crazy.</v>

753
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.040
<v Speaker 4>We see that I seen on the news they showed up.</v>

754
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

755
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And then it snowed two days ago in Sacramento or three days ago in soccer.</v>

756
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

757
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.530
<v Speaker 4>I was reading Josh Berkeley's Twitter yet.</v>

758
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 4>If it was yesterday or last night,</v>

759
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe might might've been this morning where he said,</v>

760
00:21:29.251 --> 00:21:31.410
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe there's fucking snow on my front yard.</v>

761
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Like the getting snow in Utah Right now.</v>

762
00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Still you think the government's fucker would all weather system.</v>

763
00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:37.980
<v Speaker 4>We didn't call these balloons.</v>

764
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Something's gotta be going on in guys.</v>

765
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's what's responsible for all this.</v>

766
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.961
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fun.</v>

767
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I do know that they're definitely fucking with the weather guys don't know this</v>

768
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.220
<v Speaker 4>responsible,</v>

769
00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:48.031
<v Speaker 4>those tornadoes,</v>

770
00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 4>a deadly guys.</v>

771
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:49.501
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

772
00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:50.161
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

773
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:55.080
<v Speaker 4>we only have a very limited number of years that we can study a very,</v>

774
00:21:55.081 --> 00:21:56.730
<v Speaker 4>very complex system.</v>

775
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:57.230
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

776
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.441
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

777
00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:57.751
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

778
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 4>the system of the,</v>

779
00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:01.200
<v Speaker 4>the balance of the ecosystem of the earth,</v>

780
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.460
<v Speaker 4>like where it's warm,</v>

781
00:22:02.461 --> 00:22:03.450
<v Speaker 4>where it's stormy,</v>

782
00:22:03.451 --> 00:22:03.721
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

783
00:22:03.721 --> 00:22:03.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

784
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:06.840
<v Speaker 4>where were thing that shit moves and changes,</v>

785
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

786
00:22:07.321 --> 00:22:08.580
<v Speaker 4>there's parts of like,</v>

787
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.311
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the,</v>

788
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:09.421
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

789
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 4>the big pieces of evidence that they point to a much,</v>

790
00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:18.150
<v Speaker 4>much older Egyptian society is that Egypt at one point in time where the Nile</v>

791
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.451
<v Speaker 4>River was,</v>

792
00:22:18.451 --> 00:22:18.931
<v Speaker 4>where the,</v>

793
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:21.960
<v Speaker 4>like the Sphinx is 9,000 years ago,</v>

794
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.850
<v Speaker 4>that was a tropical rain forest,</v>

795
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.080
<v Speaker 4>like 9,000 BC.</v>

796
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 4>And there's like all this water erosion on the Sphinx and the instincts and</v>

797
00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:32.910
<v Speaker 4>closure and some of the scientists use that as a point to evidence that they</v>

798
00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:36.660
<v Speaker 4>need to reconsider the age of the Egyptian culture because this is like a</v>

799
00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:37.980
<v Speaker 4>completely different environments.</v>

800
00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:40.680
<v Speaker 4>This was under initially as opposed to when they found everything,</v>

801
00:22:40.681 --> 00:22:41.210
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

802
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.780
<v Speaker 4>it was all desert and they were saying like,</v>

803
00:22:42.781 --> 00:22:43.201
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

804
00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:43.441
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

805
00:22:43.441 --> 00:22:43.591
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

806
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:43.741
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

807
00:22:43.741 --> 00:22:45.420
<v Speaker 4>wait way older than you think it is.</v>

808
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't know.</v>

809
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:51.090
<v Speaker 4>We don't really know like the real disasters that happened 20 30,000 years ago.</v>

810
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Like they just found it Lantis in Spain,</v>

811
00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:54.990
<v Speaker 4>it was reading about it in Time magazine.</v>

812
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.610
<v Speaker 4>They're almost positive that they've found the actual area where Atlantis was</v>

813
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.140
<v Speaker 4>and it guess what it is in Spain and it was hit by a fucking giant tsunami,</v>

814
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.030
<v Speaker 4>3000 something BC.</v>

815
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.780
<v Speaker 4>And that's a wrap.</v>

816
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.640
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing just changes,</v>

817
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.211
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

818
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:09.601
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

819
00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:11.730
<v Speaker 4>that happens for everywhere on the planet.</v>

820
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.060
<v Speaker 4>So we have such a limited number of years where we're sort of analyzing data as</v>

821
00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:19.370
<v Speaker 4>far as changing of,</v>

822
00:23:19.371 --> 00:23:20.520
<v Speaker 4>of the climate of the earth.</v>

823
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Speaker 4>North America,</v>

824
00:23:21.631 --> 00:23:23.130
<v Speaker 4>just 10,000 years ago,</v>

825
00:23:23.131 --> 00:23:24.930
<v Speaker 4>a blink of an eye north America,</v>

826
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 4>half of it was under a mile of ice.</v>

827
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.210
<v Speaker 4>That's just 10,000 years ago,</v>

828
00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:30.511
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

829
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:31.620
<v Speaker 4>In terms of the earth,</v>

830
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.513
<v Speaker 4>that ain't shit.</v>

831
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.710
<v Speaker 4>10,000 years ago there was people just like you.</v>

832
00:23:34.711 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 4>And I indistinguishable.</v>

833
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.530
<v Speaker 4>They could be at a movie theater.</v>

834
00:23:37.531 --> 00:23:38.281
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be able to tell,</v>

835
00:23:38.281 --> 00:23:39.360
<v Speaker 4>put them in new people clothes.</v>

836
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.740
<v Speaker 4>They were the same as us and yet North America was under a half a mile of ice,</v>

837
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.611
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

838
00:23:44.611 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 4>So there's sorts of shit that happens</v>

839
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know about.</v>

840
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.710
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

841
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.411
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

842
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 1>we know we have ice core samples and we know that we've gone through some</v>

843
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:53.700
<v Speaker 1>cooling periods and warming periods that,</v>

844
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

845
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

846
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:55.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:56.041
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

848
00:23:56.041 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant mystery is to hold it this whole cycle of the earth and whether</v>

849
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:00.381
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

850
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:00.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

851
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:02.990
<v Speaker 1>human beings are interrupting it with global warming,</v>

852
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 1>whether it's man made or whether it's just a natural cyclical thing.</v>

853
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

854
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.920
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

855
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

856
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a that you can argue one way or the other and most scientists believe</v>

857
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is not good.</v>

858
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.560
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is it changes on its own no matter what.</v>

859
00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It changed for the dinosaurs.</v>

860
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It changed for everything.</v>

861
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

862
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 1>That book.</v>

863
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Not only do we evolve with the planet evolves and 300 years we might be on the</v>

864
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:23.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking ice heat,</v>

865
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 1>probably will be an article be the hot fucking the Rio de Janeiro with the</v>

866
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Saunders.</v>

867
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

868
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

869
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 1>well they said that the,</v>

870
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

871
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the North Pole is moving,</v>

872
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>the poll is moving,</v>

873
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 1>set some weird rate of like 40 miles a year.</v>

874
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It's going gonna take a long time a year.</v>

875
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>But the like there's some sort of a,</v>

876
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

877
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural system and it constantly moves slowly,</v>

878
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>slowly in a certain direction.</v>

879
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>But they've had to like recalibrate land,</v>

880
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 1>landing strips and Florida rarely because,</v>

881
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:56.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

882
00:24:56.811 --> 00:24:57.650
<v Speaker 1>because of the fucking,</v>

883
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Speaker 1>the moving of,</v>

884
00:24:58.551 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 1>of of the Poles,</v>

885
00:24:59.660 --> 00:24:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

886
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

887
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it's shit is constantly changing mat.</v>

888
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Like this Japan thing,</v>

889
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:03.801
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

890
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel terrible for those people.</v>

891
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's terrible that these scientists built this thing and didn't really</v>

892
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 1>think it totally through and didn't really know that if you fuck this up,</v>

893
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you leave a sun in the middle of the field,</v>

894
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 1>it's going to burn through the fucking earth and you can never shut it off.</v>

895
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't we have that in the United States so they have it all over.</v>

896
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

897
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not just Japan,</v>

898
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:24.290
<v Speaker 1>it's us.</v>

899
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.180
<v Speaker 1>We do gentlemen,</v>

900
00:25:25.181 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 1>this is a wanting thing.</v>

901
00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:27.380
<v Speaker 1>United States in the United States.</v>

902
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.600
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

903
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:27.750
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

904
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.583
<v Speaker 1>God's about this.</v>

905
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not even seeing this for what this is.</v>

906
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.311
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

907
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 1>We have the most nuclear plants and plants that anybody in the fucking world</v>

908
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>right here in the United States and one of these tornadoes,</v>

909
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.660
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

910
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>We're just getting a warning,</v>

911
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 1>which we're fucking,</v>

912
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>we're not even worried about it.</v>

913
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.441
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>

914
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is with with climate change,</v>

915
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that much data.</v>

916
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 1>We have way more data on climate change that we do and what happens when you</v>

917
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:50.210
<v Speaker 1>keep a nuclear power plant around?</v>

918
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.111
<v Speaker 1>We know a few.</v>

919
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:51.820
<v Speaker 1>We know Chernobyl,</v>

920
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 1>we know three mile island and now we know all this shit in Japan,</v>

921
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but we don't even know exactly how long that thing stays active.</v>

922
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how long it takes to cool off.</v>

923
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.490
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how long exactly.</v>

924
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's radioactive.</v>

925
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:03.240
<v Speaker 1>There's always just done.</v>

926
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

927
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It's there,</v>

928
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's thousands of years.</v>

929
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:05.781
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

930
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees on that.</v>

931
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>It's thousands of years.</v>

932
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So that area is far hooked up.</v>

933
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.670
<v Speaker 1>When you live in Colorado,</v>

934
00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 1>did you hear much about rocky flats was in a paper much?</v>

935
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

936

941
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.400
<v Speaker 1>They would walk up to the road and blocking light themselves on fire.</v>

942
00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Rocky flats is,</v>

943

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.900
<v Speaker 1>The other side of the fucking Matt is rocky flats.</v>

948
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 1>If you want to look at the golden being good for growing the Rado cores.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think thing.</v>

963
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Is it a power plant?</v>

964
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

965
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.751
<v Speaker 1>The double check,</v>

966
00:26:55.751 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 1>so I don't stick my foot in my mouth.</v>

967
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:57.954
<v Speaker 1>This is the Joe Rogan.</v>

968
00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>What's it called again?</v>

969
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Rocky when rocky flats just put rocky flats and see what comes.</v>

970
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a strip club man trainees and some dirty fucking,</v>

971
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:08.904
<v Speaker 1>it's a plant.</v>

972
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a nuclear weapons production facility.</v>

973
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

974
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You have no fucking idea.</v>

975
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.883
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit.</v>

976
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 1>That's page of the prairie.</v>

977
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Close their nuclear weapons they make.</v>

978
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.240
<v Speaker 1>They make the fucking Bhagavad Gita right there and that explains the airport</v>

979
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 1>about that stuff living there.</v>

980
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It's at the craziest expression ever.</v>

981
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Trussell told us that when Oppenheimer,</v>

982
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>when the first nuclear bomb was detonated,</v>

983
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 1>he quoted the ancient Hindu scripture,</v>

984
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

985
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.390
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

986
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

987
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

988
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I am become God destroyer of worlds.</v>

989
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that the exact quote?</v>

990
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I should know his exact quote,</v>

991
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 1>but just the fact that he did that man that he quoted this ancient Hindu</v>

992
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:55.461
<v Speaker 1>scripture when he came up with some machine that cuts through the fabric or the</v>

993
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking universe,</v>

994
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.180
<v Speaker 1>it makes everything exploded.</v>

995
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It just disappear around.</v>

996
00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:01.904
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

997
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 1>rocky flats was a very sore spot in a beautiful part of the fucking country,</v>

998
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 1>which is Colorado.</v>

999
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.081
<v Speaker 1>I'll be granted,</v>

1000
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing out there,</v>

1001
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1002
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.500
<v Speaker 1>You pull up your car and there's God's there with fucking guns.</v>

1003
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Zucker's I am become death destroyer of worlds.</v>

1004
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.560
<v Speaker 1>That's your death here.</v>

1005
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.980

<v Speaker 1>I am become death to destroyer of worlds cause it's crazy listening to this</v>

1008
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:29.551
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

00:28:32.581 --> 00:28:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what the saying was?</v>

1012
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Rocky flats is near Denver.</v>

1013
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1014
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1015
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 1>it's operated from 1952 to 1992.</v>

1016
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It was under the control of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.</v>

1017
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.083
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

1018
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 6>this is Oppenheimer.</v>

1019
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 6>People were silent,</v>

1020
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 6>tear the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

1021
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.673
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1022
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.820
<v Speaker 6>now I ended up coming the,</v>

1023
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.963
<v Speaker 6>by</v>

1024
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.433
<v Speaker 6>the way or another.</v>

1025
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1026
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine the responsibility that you must feel that were</v>

1027
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 4>at least credited as the one man that without whom the nuclear bomb might have</v>

1028
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 4>never been created.</v>

1029
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 4>It just took eight minutes to say,</v>

1030
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:51.191
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1031
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 4>I fucked some shit up Jack.</v>

1032
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.440
<v Speaker 4>you do much drama just to get to the fucking bat.</v>

1034
00:29:55.441 --> 00:29:55.961
<v Speaker 4>When he said,</v>

1035
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:56.561
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>

1036
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

1037
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that's fascinating.</v>

1038
00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1039
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that guy's a super duper genius.</v>

1040
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.493
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1041
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 4>he quotes Hindu scripture.</v>

1042
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 4>I am become death.</v>

1043
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 4>The destroyer of worlds and knowing that what he's done was change everything.</v>

1044
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Change everything to the point where you have some device that you can detonate</v>

1045
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 4>that makes everything around.</v>

1046
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:17.180
<v Speaker 4>It disappeared.</v>

1047
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 4>It disappeared,</v>

1048
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 4>and there's so much bigger now than they were.</v>

1049
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.640
<v Speaker 4>There's the fucking months,</v>

1050
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 4>like the power that we have,</v>

1051
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 4>like those Hiroshima ones,</v>

1052
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.281
<v Speaker 4>the Nagasaki went,</v>

1053
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:25.114
<v Speaker 4>those are okay,</v>

1054
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 4>but we got like way stronger shit now and they're working on shit that's even</v>

1055
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 4>stronger than that.</v>

1056
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.131
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1057
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:32.260
<v Speaker 4>they're working on anti matter weapons.</v>

1058
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 4>They're working on anti-matter weapons,</v>

1059
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Speaker 4>which would literally like dissolve matter.</v>

1060
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 4>They would literally,</v>

1061
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck form it takes as a weapon,</v>

1062
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a bomb or a beam or it would just everything.</v>

1063
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 4>It would just destroy everything.</v>

1064
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 4>It would be like thousands of times stronger than we could ever imagine any bomb</v>

1065
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 4>being today,</v>

1066
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 4>and maybe even more than that.</v>

1067
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm just coming up with numbers,</v>

1068
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 4>but they don't stop.</v>

1069
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.191
<v Speaker 4>They don't stop.</v>

1070
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.024
<v Speaker 4>They don't stop with,</v>

1071
00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 4>they don't stop with nuclear bombs.</v>

1072
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 4>They don't stop with this,</v>

1073
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.211
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1074
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:01.921
<v Speaker 4>this possible.</v>

1075
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1076
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 4>if they really can do anti-matter weapons,</v>

1077
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 4>they're not gonna stop with that.</v>

1078
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the next thing is,</v>

1079
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be even more fun.</v>

1080
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Does it just seems like they should stop?</v>

1081
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It should.</v>

1082
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.570
<v Speaker 3>It should stop retarded.</v>

1083
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I figured out how to kill life as it stands today with a press of a button</v>

1084
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:16.790
<v Speaker 3>button.</v>

1085
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1086
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1087
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 3>What else is worth?</v>

1088
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I could dissolve you with a fucking gun.</v>

1089
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Go below you to fuck up.</v>

1090
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to blow you to fuck up.</v>

1091
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think people continue to push in that direction?</v>

1092
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Is it just that we have this natural tendency to accelerate everything</v>

1093
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.703
<v Speaker 3>king of the hill?</v>

1094
00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1095
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 3>we want to be bigger than that.</v>

1096
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.030
<v Speaker 3>The next person we want to have,</v>

1097
00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.123
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1098
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:31:37.461 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 4>But even in a position where the United States is right now,</v>

1100
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.570
<v Speaker 4>we're not really threatened by anybody.</v>

1101
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:43.051
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1102
00:31:43.051 --> 00:31:43.710
<v Speaker 4>there's some other,</v>

1103
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 4>there's some other countries that have nuclear power and there's other countries</v>

1104
00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:47.340
<v Speaker 4>that have strong armies,</v>

1105
00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:48.510
<v Speaker 4>but without a doubt,</v>

1106
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 4>this is the biggest super power the world has ever known by a long shot.</v>

1107
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.720
<v Speaker 4>But we continue to come up with newer,</v>

1108
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:55.650
<v Speaker 4>crazier shit.</v>

1109
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1110
00:31:56.131 --> 00:31:57.930
<v Speaker 4>I guess you have to stay where you at.</v>

1111
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.500
<v Speaker 4>You have to,</v>

1112
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:58.891
<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>

1113
00:31:58.891 --> 00:31:59.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1114
00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:00.170
<v Speaker 4>if you're the big bully your,</v>

1115
00:32:00.171 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 4>you've got to always have the biggest stick.</v>

1116
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.330
<v Speaker 4>You have always be ready.</v>

1117
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.310
<v Speaker 4>Always be ready for those motherfuckers coming up.</v>

1118
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 4>Keep them,</v>

1119
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.660
<v Speaker 4>keep them down.</v>

1120
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Keep our fucking way of life.</v>

1121
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.840
<v Speaker 4>And who was memorial day?</v>

1122
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what our troops,</v>

1123
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:11.874
<v Speaker 4>boys,</v>

1124
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.783
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

1125
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.770
<v Speaker 4>But God damn man,</v>

1126
00:32:13.771 --> 00:32:14.021
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1127
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:16.140
<v Speaker 4>when you really fucking think about it like where does it end?</v>

1128
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.561
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1129
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know they thought about this shit when he was saying that when he was</v>

1130
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:20.670
<v Speaker 4>saying this,</v>

1131
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1132
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:22.770
<v Speaker 4>I am become death to story of worlds.</v>

1133
00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:27.060
<v Speaker 4>He was terrified with the fuck had he done with the fuck even when he was</v>

1134
00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:28.790
<v Speaker 4>fucking doing can imagine going to pink berry.</v>

1135
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck he was doing.</v>

1136
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Of course he did Joey.</v>

1137
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.210
<v Speaker 4>But what it's also one of those things with,</v>

1138
00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:34.110
<v Speaker 4>with scientists,</v>

1139
00:32:34.111 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1140
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 4>they are scientists because they are inherently incredibly curious people</v>

1141
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 4>curious and they're fucking genius and they want,</v>

1142
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing your things out.</v>

1143
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 4>And if there is a problem presented to them,</v>

1144
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1145
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1146
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1147
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:46.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1148
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 4>can you develop a nuclear bomb?</v>

1149
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Can I,</v>

1150
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.761
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1151
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Can I?</v>

1152
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.080
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1153
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I think I think we can.</v>

1154
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.061
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1155
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:53.151
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1156
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1157
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1158
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.431
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

1159
00:32:54.431 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 4>the natural inclination whether or not it's used or not is to create it.</v>

1160
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 4>And you can always justify it by saying,</v>

1161
00:32:59.451 --> 00:32:59.571
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1162
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 4>we have to create it first because if we don't create it first than the Nazis</v>

1163
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:03.171
<v Speaker 4>will get it.</v>

1164
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 4>And then the fuck everybody up.</v>

1165
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.203
<v Speaker 4>That's all you need.</v>

1166
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.021
<v Speaker 4>And then everybody says,</v>

1167
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1168
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 4>let's make it,</v>

1169
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 4>and it's right.</v>

1170
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1171
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1172
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 4>the world is way better with America running things and of Nazi Germany had</v>

1173
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:13.910
<v Speaker 4>taken over in 1947 hopefully.</v>

1174
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully it's way better now.</v>

1205
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 4>to me like the gay pride parade.</v>

1211
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I was dripping down my mom's leg.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

1213
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never understood war anymore.</v>

1214
00:34:01.151 --> 00:34:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I've never understood all these lives.</v>

1215
00:34:03.971 --> 00:34:05.320
<v Speaker 1>To get your point across.</v>

1216
00:34:05.321 --> 00:34:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I have a disagreement.</v>

1217
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I never understood this,</v>

1221
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've never really enjoyed about war.</v>

1222
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:19.751
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

1223
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:21.550
<v Speaker 1>war was cash wore.</v>

1224

<v Speaker 1>His economy.</v>

1225
00:34:22.361 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>War is manufacturing.</v>

1226
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:24.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1227
00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what America does.</v>

1228
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.741
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

1269
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that,</v>

1270
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:55.411
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1271
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the a minor thing in comparison to the casualties.</v>

1272
00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 1>They suffer in Iraq.</v>

1278
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible when American soldiers die,</v>

1279
00:36:04.841 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's also terrible when Iraqi and Afghanistan civilians die too.</v>

1280
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1285
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:15.050
<v Speaker 1>1 million people have died in Iraq altogether.</v>

1286
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant number,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

1309
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:38.191
<v Speaker 1>It's not no one,</v>

1310
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 1>no one saying what's bad or what's worse.</v>

1311
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 1>They're both fucking horrible and disgusting.</v>

1312
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.211
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1313

1317
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And because we don't experience it over here,</v>

1318
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>the only people that truly appreciate what the fuck is happening in the world</v>

1319
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 1>are veterans.</v>

1320
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.960

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:29.181
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

1344
00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:31.970

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So that scene when he's in the bedroom and he's smashing the window with karate</v>

1620
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.690
<v Speaker 1>They'd cook that Martin whatever launch he was 16 and took him to the</v>

00:44:16.691 --> 00:44:17.231
<v Speaker 1>Philippines.</v>

1667
00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 4>it should be against the law that you shouldn't even be allowed to have have</v>

1668
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 4>babies before 21.</v>

1685
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile he's banging some 15 year old and he apparently they got together and</v>

1686
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 4>made out a few times when she was 15.</v>

1687
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:11.850

1688
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.180
<v Speaker 4>which is technically illegal in the state of Washington.</v>

1689
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.550
<v Speaker 4>But they're going after him anyway because he was a teacher.</v>

1690
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 4>And because it's creepy.</v>

1717

1718
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1719

<v Speaker 4>And it isn't only in what state?</v>

1720
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1721
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 4>this is the supreme court sets a precedent.</v>

1722
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean all the marijuana laws or federal,</v>

1723
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.581
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>

1724
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:21.001
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1725
00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:23.460
<v Speaker 4>there's state laws but they're not supposed to be real.</v>

1726
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Like in the marijuana,</v>

1727
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:24.891
<v Speaker 4>like in,</v>

1728
00:47:24.891 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 4>in the medical marijuana,</v>

1729
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 4>California met California says we allow medical marijuana,</v>

1730
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 4>it's passed in 1994 and everyone says it's legal and Hunky Dory.</v>

1731
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 4>The federal government can still come in and say,</v>

1732
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1733
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 4>federally marijuana is a schedule one drug and you're all under arrest.</v>

1734
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 4>All you people that are helping out cancer patients and AIDS patients,</v>

1735
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 4>you're in jail.</v>

1736
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 4>And they did that for a long ass time.</v>

1737
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Not only did they do that,</v>

1738
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 4>but when they got arrested,</v>

1739
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 4>this is where it's really fucked up.</v>

1740
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 4>They didn't allow them to use the expression medical marijuana,</v>

1741
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 4>you can't use it because federally that term doesn't exist.</v>

1742
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.331
<v Speaker 4>So they say,</v>

1743
00:47:58.331 --> 00:47:58.481
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1744
00:47:58.481 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 4>you selling weed,</v>

1745
00:47:59.500 --> 00:47:59.831
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

1746
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:00.311
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

1747
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:01.970
<v Speaker 4>but I was selling medical matter that did the,</v>

1748
00:48:01.971 --> 00:48:02.251
<v Speaker 4>did the,</v>

1749
00:48:02.251 --> 00:48:03.084
<v Speaker 4>did the,</v>

1750
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.970
<v Speaker 4>so you have to say yes,</v>

1751
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.823
<v Speaker 4>I was telling we,</v>

1752
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you can't say no.</v>

1753
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to ask you if it's cancer patients,</v>

1754
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:10.750
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to ask you if it's aids patients.</v>

1755
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>

1756
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 4>What they're going to say is they're gonna allow you to only say what they want</v>

1757
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 4>you to say that will incriminate you.</v>

1758
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 4>They're not gonna allow you to even use the expression medical marijuana so that</v>

1759
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:24.640
<v Speaker 4>that federally shows how they operate.</v>

1760
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:26.560
<v Speaker 4>But now this new new,</v>

1761
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 4>the fourth amendment of the constitution is that the right of the people to be</v>

1762
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:31.780

1763
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 4>papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be</v>

1764
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:38.950
<v Speaker 4>violated and no warrants shall issue,</v>

1765
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.040

1767
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.350
<v Speaker 4>So they have to have a notice.</v>

1768
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 4>They have to have,</v>

1769
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.180
<v Speaker 4>they have to go to a judge.</v>

1770
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:52.631

1775
00:48:56.771 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 4>This guy's a bad guy and this is what we know about them.</v>

1785
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure it.</v>

1786
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 4>It's just keep going with it the other way.</v>

1787
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.163
<v Speaker 4>The other way.</v>

1788
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:14.860

1791
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.793
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1792
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.660
<v Speaker 4>How can you not figure this out?</v>

1793
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:20.494
<v Speaker 4>You're driving me crazy.</v>

1794
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.740
<v Speaker 4>Well that doubt there cope bank guy.</v>

1795
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1796
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 4>so now,</v>

1797
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 4>so now you don't have to go through all that whole process.</v>

1798
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Probably don't have to go through that.</v>

1799
00:49:27.401 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 4>All the,</v>

1800
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.690
<v Speaker 4>all the cop has to do is knock on your door and say,</v>

1801
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 4>I think that you're smoking weed in there.</v>

1802
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.470
<v Speaker 4>Let me in.</v>

1803
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 4>And then if they hear you destroying evidence,</v>

1804
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1805
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.480
<v Speaker 4>it could be a toilet flush going,</v>

1806
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:42.941
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>

1807
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:44.610
<v Speaker 4>The cops are here are destroying evidence.</v>

1808
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.760
<v Speaker 4>I think whatever noise that they're going to decipher might be you,</v>

1809
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 4>but it's up to them to decide.</v>

1810
00:49:49.631 --> 00:49:50.540
<v Speaker 4>And then they kicked down</v>

1811
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.640
<v Speaker 4>the United States of America when they kicking their door.</v>

1812
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 4>This is Kentucky versus kings is a u s supreme court.</v>

1813
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.541
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1814
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:02.860
<v Speaker 4>this is a federal case when they kick in your door though and they see that you</v>

1815
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 4>have marijuana and you get like the $80 ticket,</v>

1816
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean are they allowed to bust you for anything else?</v>

1817
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:08.310
<v Speaker 4>They see,</v>

1818
00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.560
<v Speaker 4>cause you know how like with $80 ticket is only a state thing.</v>

1819
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:12.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not a physical thing.</v>

1820
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1821
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 4>But I'm saying if they,</v>

1822
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 4>if they bust on your door,</v>

1823
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 4>can they only arrest you for weed or you know how like,</v>

1824
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:21.190
<v Speaker 4>you know how they gonna arrest you for anything that you got in your fucking</v>

1825
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 4>house once they're in,</v>

1826
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:23.740
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>

1827
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.690
<v Speaker 4>if see if they'd get it.</v>

1828
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

1829
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's say if they get a war and they search your house,</v>

1830
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 4>like if they had a warrant for good,</v>

1831
00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:29.510
<v Speaker 4>they think you're selling cocaine,</v>

1832
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1833
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And they go to your house and there's five dead bodies,</v>

1834
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.031
<v Speaker 4>there's still,</v>

1835
00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 4>they're going to arrest you for murder.</v>

1836
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.873
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1837
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.631
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

1838
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 4>this is a scary thing because this is allows cops just say they smelled pot,</v>

1839
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 4>but these were only talking about pot.</v>

1840
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you are going to break down someone's fucking house because not</v>

1841
00:50:45.591 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 4>even you smelled them growing it.</v>

1842
00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 4>You smell the smoke,</v>

1843
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you smell them using it,</v>

1844
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 4>so you smell them doing something that they want to do and you have a law where</v>

1845
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:59.370
<v Speaker 4>you can break down the door if you think that they're destroying that pod that</v>

1846
00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to smoke.</v>

1847
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 4>You think they're flushing it?</v>

1848
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 4>That is so these are the feds and they come with the house.</v>

1849
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1850
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is all about.</v>

1851
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.790
<v Speaker 5>The feds ain't coming to my house.</v>

1852
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 5>Your House or web band.</v>

1853
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:10.281
<v Speaker 5>That's what I,</v>

1854
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 5>that's what I was just going to get to.</v>

1855
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.583
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1856
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1857
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:15.630
<v Speaker 5>just to add to people guys,</v>

1858
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 5>it's like a ricoh or Rico fucking fucks everybody up in the ass.</v>

1859
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't talk to Joe Rogan.</v>

1860
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.550
<v Speaker 5>I just see him once a fucking month.</v>

1861
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.610
<v Speaker 5>But if you're going to Joe Rogan and you give him cash and he brings it to me,</v>

1862
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:27.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm involved with whatever Joe Rogan's doing.</v>

1863
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.521
<v Speaker 5>You understand me?</v>

1864
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 5>It's a criminal enterprise.</v>

1865
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:34.070
<v Speaker 5>So now they added this so you can nail you in a different fucking man.</v>

1866
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.210
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to apply now.</v>

1867
00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:36.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1868
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.480
<v Speaker 5>when are they going to bust out my door and get it or you go get a warrant.</v>

1869
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1870
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.010
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

1871
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:44.023
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>

1872
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's still retarded in scaring.</v>

1873
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:45.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1874
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 4>I understand the idea.</v>

1875
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I agree that it's probably not going to come up in our lives,</v>

1876
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to come up in somebody's life and the only reason why it exists</v>

1877
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:57.581
<v Speaker 4>at all is because is these a bunch of clueless old fucks that are in charge of</v>

1878
00:51:57.951 --> 00:51:58.420
<v Speaker 4>running shit</v>

1879
00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.253
<v Speaker 5>this country?</v>

1880
00:51:59.260 --> 00:51:59.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1881
00:51:59.381 --> 00:52:00.490
<v Speaker 5>this isn't always going to happen.</v>

1882
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.410
<v Speaker 5>If they went by sending your door,</v>

1883
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.490
<v Speaker 5>they'll find a thousand of their ways to get in the door.</v>

1884
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1885
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:05.020
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>

1886
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.411
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1887
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:05.621
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1888
00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:06.281
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1889
00:52:06.281 --> 00:52:07.180
<v Speaker 5>they don't need help.</v>

1890
00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.073
<v Speaker 5>They don't need this now.</v>

1891
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.500
<v Speaker 5>They don't need to help buy the fucking federal government nine 11 I was going</v>

1892
00:52:11.501 --> 00:52:12.940
<v Speaker 5>to change our life forever.</v>

1893
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.340
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't an AED type deal,</v>

1894
00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:18.580
<v Speaker 5>but it changed our life and our liberties.</v>

1895
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.210
<v Speaker 5>A lot of our liberties chains and it goes back to the 11 I don't know how this</v>

1896
00:52:22.211 --> 00:52:23.044
<v Speaker 5>goes back to it,</v>

1897
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.480
<v Speaker 5>but this is just one of the steps that they're taking.</v>

1898
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1899
00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:27.080
<v Speaker 4>but it's the Joey.</v>

1900
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:28.250
<v Speaker 4>You can say that all you want,</v>

1901
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:28.861
<v Speaker 4>but when you're there,</v>

1902
00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:32.500
<v Speaker 4>the law is specifically about smelling marijuana.</v>

1903
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.241
<v Speaker 4>It's hot.</v>

1904
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:33.891
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1905
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:35.960
<v Speaker 4>That's not protecting anybody from anything,</v>

1906
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1907
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 4>This is nonsense.</v>

1908
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 4>This is just nonsense.</v>

1909
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 4>That by people that bought into propaganda and have shown through the decisions,</v>

1910
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 4>if you showed that this is the way you,</v>

1911
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1912
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.040
<v Speaker 4>you think after you've really experienced and look at all the evidence,</v>

1913
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 4>all that tells me is you're grossly incompetent.</v>

1914
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 4>Not just grossly incompetent,</v>

1915
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:55.250
<v Speaker 4>but criminally incompetent.</v>

1916
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:59.660
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you're there to serve and protect and you would actively seek to</v>

1917
00:52:59.661 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 4>lock people up in jail for a plant that's never killed.</v>

1918
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:05.600
<v Speaker 4>A single fucking human being on the face of the planet.</v>

1919
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.580
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever owed deed from it ever.</v>

1920
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:08.220
<v Speaker 4>It can't.</v>

1921
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 4>It can't happen.</v>

1922
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.070
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the most innocuous natural substances you could possibly wrap your</v>

1923
00:53:13.071 --> 00:53:13.904
<v Speaker 4>fucking head around.</v>

1924
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.190
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that these cons have made a law where if they smell you enjoying</v>

1925
00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 4>this fantastic plant that makes sex better and food tastes better and makes you</v>

1926
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>more creative and they smell it,</v>

1927
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 4>they can kick down your</v>

1928
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking door and lock you in a cage.</v>

1929
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:31.320
<v Speaker 1>This is some draconian or well,</v>

1930
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 1>1984 movie type shit.</v>

1931
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

1932
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I fucking go and hit a weed store with a gun at lunchtime would read,</v>

1933
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 1>man read Ben's real driver is he the driver gets the gun a thousand.</v>

1934
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.423
<v Speaker 1>They love the story.</v>

1935
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 1>They come in front of my house.</v>

1936
00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's go over there.</v>

1937
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's go over there and watch whatever the fuck they got to do now is knock on</v>

1938
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 1>the fucking door,</v>

1939
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 1>knock on the door and say,</v>

1940
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 1>we smoked weed and flying to go,</v>

1941
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:01.141
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1942
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:01.974
<v Speaker 1>Red Bands here.</v>

1943
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.881
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you had,</v>

1944
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:04.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say Joe Rogan has a warrant.</v>

1945
00:54:04.401 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 1>He comes to my house for dinner.</v>

1946
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 1>This is all this.</v>

1947
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:09.770
<v Speaker 1>This is just less paperwork for his cock suckers.</v>

1948
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't even make you go home and get a warrant.</v>

1949
00:54:12.121 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So what you're telling me is that they smell it.</v>

1950
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have to go to the judge and get signed off on a warrant telling</v>

1951
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:17.940
<v Speaker 1>me exactly,</v>

1952
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.530
<v Speaker 1>this is all part of something different.</v>

1953
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 1>This is all part of the rolling.</v>

1954
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1955
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that.</v>

1956
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 1>If you say you smelled the gun shot and smell gun powder,</v>

1957
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what the best thing about [inaudible] smell that he showed up at one</v>

1958
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:32.200
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

1959
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200
<v Speaker 1>he showed you the other one.</v>

1960
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It became a depressant.</v>

1961
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>The problem that's going on in this country,</v>

1962
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.751
<v Speaker 1>none of you fucking Mo,</v>

1972
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse.</v>

1973
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 1>They're knocking on your fucking door for smelling marijuana.</v>

1974
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.811
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1975
00:54:57.811 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 1>It's 2011.</v>

1976
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:59.491
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1977
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And Japan is dying over there.</v>

1978
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.801
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1979
00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 1>That these countries,</v>

1980
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be another earthquake and a few fucking weeks.</v>

1981
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:05.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1982
00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1983
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but when we're worried about you will really,</v>

1984
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.150
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1985
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 1>so what communism aren't you talking about?</v>

1986
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 1>They take everything on.</v>

1987
00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Every computer is a fucking camera.</v>

1988
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:15.024
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

1989
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if you want to call it,</v>

1990
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to call it communism,</v>

1991
00:55:18.031 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 1>but I agree that it's government.</v>

1992
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's government is getting bigger and government wants more and more power and</v>

1993
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:26.010

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:03.990
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you,</v>

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.690
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty man.</v>

2071

<v Speaker 5>What is the first thing I say to you when they answer the phone?</v>

2078
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 5>When you answer the phone,</v>

<v Speaker 5>State the state.</v>

2095
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 5>if I can't curse and an open line,</v>

2096
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.160

2097
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.150

2115
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.800
<v Speaker 5>they could use that as a law to bring you in and then they start getting you for</v>

2116
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:36.520

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2124
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:42.220

<v Speaker 5>let's say you're a fan of this technique.</v>

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.160
<v Speaker 5>If I push red man and Redman has no witnesses,</v>

2131
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.300
<v Speaker 5>they have 72 hours to charge me with the crime for Redman,</v>

2132
00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 5>for Bush and red band.</v>

2133
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:59.860
<v Speaker 5>If they don't get 72 those 72 hours or a window for them to get you for other</v>

<v Speaker 5>Whenever they tapped you on the phone.</v>

2159
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 5>If I have a phone tap,</v>

2160
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.421
<v Speaker 5>it's like crying.</v>

2161
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 5>You don't know when you just call me because you're my friend.</v>

2162
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Right after they arrested me and they take me to trial,</v>

2163
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get a bunch of mail telling you that we were listening to you on</v>

2164
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:55.784
<v Speaker 5>an open line.</v>

2165
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.490
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2166
00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:56.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:57.291
<v Speaker 5>they have.</v>

2168
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 5>These are things they have to do.</v>

2169
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 5>See in the old days you knew if your line was tapped,</v>

2170
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 5>all you had to do was go to your phone box.</v>

2171
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.960
<v Speaker 5>The feds in those days,</v>

2172
01:00:04.961 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 5>we're putting a tag on your phone that said property of the United States</v>

2173
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:09.620
<v Speaker 5>government didn't take a genius.</v>

2174
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:11.450
<v Speaker 5>They would have to put tags now that don't have that.</v>

2175
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:11.961
<v Speaker 5>No more of that.</v>

2176
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:15.020
<v Speaker 5>And they can tag you or bugs or they could tag in the box and the tree.</v>

2177
01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.161
<v Speaker 5>But in the old days,</v>

2178
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.210
<v Speaker 5>if you lived in an apartment,</v>

2179
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 5>you'll find phone line.</v>

2180
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.130
<v Speaker 5>It was getting tagged or there was a box in a tree.</v>

2181
01:00:20.131 --> 01:00:21.840
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere we didn't do was kick the bucket.</v>

2211
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 5>This conversation and I was in Vegas for the UFC and I go,</v>

2217
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 5>And then she got a call from the cop look up.</v>

2218
01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:17.510
<v Speaker 5>They can't come over to the rest of it because they're not,</v>

2219
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.950
<v Speaker 5>they're just saying they're fucking around.</v>

2220
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 5>But let's pretend joggers and under suspicion for something and they're trying</v>

2221
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:24.600

<v Speaker 5>that we know.</v>

2223
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 5>All we need is 24 hours to get them.</v>

2224
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 5>They're wiring me while they're listening to me.</v>

2225
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:30.940
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

2226
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.360
<v Speaker 5>we're tap that fucking line.</v>

2227
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 5>This is how beautiful the law works for you.</v>

2228
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:34.910
<v Speaker 5>Some time,</v>

2229
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.691
<v Speaker 5>tap that line.</v>

2230
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Where is he talking to Vegas?</v>

2231
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.521
<v Speaker 5>Go get,</v>

2232
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:40.670
<v Speaker 5>go get him for opening over talking over a fucking,</v>

2233
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2234
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.030
<v Speaker 5>ultimately they have an open line wearing over an open level or federal</v>

2235
01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:46.200
<v Speaker 5>boundaries and they'll come fucking knock on my door.</v>

2236
01:01:46.201 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 5>And take me down there for 24 hours.</v>

2237
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.940
<v Speaker 5>Then released me to say it was a technicality,</v>

2238
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 5>but at least they took me off the street for 24 hours and Austin as I'm getting</v>

2239
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:54.110
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

2240
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 5>I'll say,</v>

2241
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.191
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2242
01:01:55.191 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 5>Mr. Diaz,</v>

2243
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.050
<v Speaker 5>we have another sheet of paper for your warrant.</v>

2244
01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:58.971
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do.</v>

2245
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:00.680
<v Speaker 5>That and then they bring it right back.</v>

2246
01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:00.981
<v Speaker 5>Can Be,</v>

2247
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 5>all these rules are going to be to help a different case.</v>

2248
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.940
<v Speaker 5>A Rico case strengthens the case when I got in trouble for kidnapping.</v>

2249
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.810
<v Speaker 5>If you get arrested for two or more violent crimes at the same time,</v>

2250
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:12.591
<v Speaker 5>so let's see,</v>

2251
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:14.210
<v Speaker 5>you got a shot one and assault to,</v>

2252
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.330
<v Speaker 5>they automatically have to charge you with crime of violence.</v>

2253
01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 5>It's a state law.</v>

2254
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 5>So the assault one,</v>

2255
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>what's an assault to Swat?</v>

2256
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you hit him in the head with a fucking pipe?</v>

2257
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I sought to you shut the bottle up his ass.</v>

2258
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2259
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.890
<v Speaker 1>There's different degrees of,</v>

2260
01:02:26.891 --> 01:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>you see this guy in Oklahoma that's getting a,</v>

2261
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>he's getting first degree murder because he got robbed and he,</v>

2262
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:34.081
<v Speaker 1>this is what he did.</v>

2263
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>He went outside is a video of it.</v>

2264
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2265
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.451
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2266
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>they pull out a gun.</v>

2267
01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:37.591
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2268
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>give us your money.</v>

2269
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>He pulls out his gun and shoots the fucking guys run.</v>

2270
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>There's two guys in the place.</v>

2271
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>The first guy he hit with a bullet and he was a guy who didn't have the gun.</v>

2272
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So the one guy had a gun,</v>

2273
01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>one guy didn't,</v>

2274
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>he shoots the guy who doesn't have the gun.</v>

01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:07.630

<v Speaker 1>I can understand.</v>

2370
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I can understand.</v>

2371
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I understand the idea behind making it easier for law enforcement.</v>

2372
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm hundred percent pro law enforcement.</v>

2373
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot</v>

2374
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 4>of cops and I know a lot of good cops and I know a lot of cops that are good</v>

2375
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>

2376
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.940
<v Speaker 4>And I know most cops get a shitty wrapped.</v>

2377
01:05:23.941 --> 01:05:25.370
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time when you're talking to the cops,</v>

2378
01:05:25.371 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 4>it's cause you fucked up.</v>

2379
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.371
<v Speaker 4>That's reality.</v>

2380
01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:28.690
<v Speaker 4>And we've all fucked up before.</v>

2381
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.140
<v Speaker 4>But I've found in my life that if you're respectful and you treat the cops</v>

2382
01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:35.590
<v Speaker 4>straightforward and don't give him a fucking hard time and,</v>

2383
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:37.630

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2385
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 4>just accept what's going on.</v>

2388
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.481
<v Speaker 4>Society.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so that's 15 fucking years.</v>

2559
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 1>So they gave this guy a 20 year sentence member.</v>

2560
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 1>The more the violent crime,</v>

2561
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 1>the parole board turns you down.</v>

2562
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:15.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you're getting 20 years,</v>

2563
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:16.191
<v Speaker 1>you do 10.</v>

2564
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 1>But the parole board could turn you down eight times is even if you do heinous</v>

2565
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:21.291
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2566
01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:21.471
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2567
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:24.980
<v Speaker 1>There was a dude who got released a couple of years ago in Houston and this guy,</v>

2568
01:10:24.981 --> 01:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2569
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2570
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I forget how many,</v>

2571
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2572
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a long time ago,</v>

2573
01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 1>murdered some grandmother and this little girl,</v>

2574
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the girl was like three or four and he drowned her in the fucking</v>

2575
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:35.991
<v Speaker 1>toilet,</v>

2576
01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:36.824
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2577
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy was a killer.</v>

2578
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.360
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a hardcore evil motherfucker.</v>

2579
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Killed this grandmother in front of the daughter,</v>

2580
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 1>the granddaughter and the good dark granddaughters making too much noise.</v>

2581
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So he drowned her in the toilet and killed the both of them and went to jail and</v>

2582
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.470
<v Speaker 1>then they let them out and then we'll let him out.</v>

2583
01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:54.350
<v Speaker 1>He just immediately started killing checks immediately.</v>

2584
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 1>By the time they got to his house,</v>

2585
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>they found a one of those big drums,</v>

2586
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.650
<v Speaker 1>those big metal drums with some woman chopped up and stuffed inside of it and</v>

2587
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 1>they found evidence of another murder somewhere else in this house.</v>

2588
01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And then they couldn't find the fuck.</v>

2589
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they ever saw many fucked up.</v>

2590
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:09.771
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

2591
01:11:09.771 --> 01:11:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a very intelligent guy and you understand that people make mistakes when</v>

2592
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you can drown</v>

2593
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:14.860
<v Speaker 5>a baby.</v>

2594
01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:15.840
<v Speaker 5>Sure you're dead.</v>

2595
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 5>So you right now what I'm trying to say to you in person,</v>

2596
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to say to you is things are bad.</v>

2597
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 5>I got a family,</v>

2598
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 5>I know people and I go out there and I sling some weeds.</v>

2599
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 5>I get fucking eight years for swinging fucking weed and they,</v>

2600
01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 5>and they locked me and put me under the fucking jail.</v>

2601
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 5>But this guy that the system failed and they let their mind,</v>

2602
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:33.980
<v Speaker 5>and this is the flaws I see that they got out.</v>

2603
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 5>They listen man.</v>

2604
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 5>If it's your first time offender and for cocaine,</v>

2605
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 5>I think they should give you a stiff penalty upfront so you understand what it's</v>

2606
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:42.720
<v Speaker 5>like behind back there.</v>

2607
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's the only way you'll learn.</v>

2608
01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 5>The same way I learned,</v>

2609
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.150
<v Speaker 5>because once you go back there and they ain't no fucking joke,</v>

2610
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.820
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not talking about what are you going to get a rate and don't drop the</v>

2611
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:53.910
<v Speaker 5>song I'm talking about you miss your peeps,</v>

2612
01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 5>Bro,</v>

2613
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:54.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2614
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.250
<v Speaker 5>The people who love you and have faith in you,</v>

2615
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 5>they're the ones you hurt.</v>

2616
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 5>And when you see their faces,</v>

2617
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 5>that's when you make a decision.</v>

2618
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 5>Either you're going to go back there or you're fucking not.</v>

2619
01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:05.220
<v Speaker 5>I feel that everybody should pay for what they've done in society.</v>

2620
01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 5>It's the only way you're going to learn from it.</v>

2621
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 5>I keep giving you probation.</v>

2622
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.520
<v Speaker 5>You're going to keep doing the same shit and let's do it all hand.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Let's be honest.</v>

2698
01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:59.180
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that area's pills.</v>

2699
01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2700
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:02.280
<v Speaker 5>if that even makes it worse,</v>

2701
01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.260
<v Speaker 5>my fucking lip.</v>

2702
01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.490
<v Speaker 5>The problem is pills and pills are everywhere.</v>

2703
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 5>We talked about it on the podcast before,</v>

2704
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 5>but if you haven't seen it,</v>

2705
01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 5>it's available online.</v>

2706
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 5>You need to watch episode of Van Guard</v>

2707
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 4>called the Oxycontin Express and they go into a vanguard is this net?</v>

2708
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those shows on one of those weird networks or you're not exactly</v>

2709
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:21.311
<v Speaker 4>sure what it is,</v>

2710
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 4>like true TV or some shit like that.</v>

2711
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:25.300
<v Speaker 4>But if you can find it on your Dvr,</v>

2712
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 4>it's the shit because they go on these like investigative journalistic</v>

2713
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:31.540
<v Speaker 4>adventures and undercover a lot of shit.</v>

2714
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things they did is they uncovered the whole situation down in</v>

2715
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>

2716
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 4>It's called the Oxycontin Express.</v>

2717
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:39.340
<v Speaker 4>And it shows how they have these pain management centers in Florida.</v>

2718
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:41.230
<v Speaker 4>And Florida doesn't have a database.</v>

2719
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:43.840
<v Speaker 4>So if you got a prescription for Oxycontin,</v>

2720
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 4>which you could easily down there say,</v>

2721
01:14:45.641 --> 01:14:45.821
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2722
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:46.840
<v Speaker 4>my back's fucked up.</v>

2723
01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:47.411
<v Speaker 4>They look at you,</v>

2724
01:14:47.411 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

2725
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 4>one of the guys a little overweight,</v>

2726
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's got a back problem.</v>

2727
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:50.890
<v Speaker 4>Here you go,</v>

2728
01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 4>they write you a prescription,</v>

2729
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 4>they're in the office and you go right next door in the same fucking building.</v>

2730
01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 4>And they've got the Oxycontin and they sell it to you.</v>

2731
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're legal heroin dealers and they have no database.</v>

2732
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:05.710
<v Speaker 4>So if you went to doctor Joey Diaz and got your prescription,</v>

2733
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 4>you could get out of the car,</v>

2734
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 4>drive right down the street and go to doctor Joe Rogan and doctor Joe Rogan</v>

2735
01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:11.950
<v Speaker 4>writes a prescription for you too.</v>

2736
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 4>And then you go down the street,</v>

2737
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 4>another fucking 20 miles down the road and get another prescription and you can</v>

2738
01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 4>do it over and over again because they can't compare.</v>

2739
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:22.000
<v Speaker 4>So you can just show up these pain management centers and get 30,</v>

2740
01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:23.080
<v Speaker 4>40 fucking pills.</v>

2741
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 4>And these people are the called the oxycontin express because people are driving</v>

2742
01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.900
<v Speaker 4>down from Kentucky and Ohio.</v>

2743
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Speaker 4>They're driving down this highway to access the,</v>

2744
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:31.961

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 4>they show the inside of this building.</v>

2781
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>The body of Christ compels you.</v>

2782
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:47.110

2791
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So I've been kind of Joan solving,</v>

2838
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:59.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I saw it,</v>

2839
01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.083
<v Speaker 3>you saw a picture.</v>

2840
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.890
<v Speaker 3>One of the caps I had was about the size of a,</v>

2841
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.490
<v Speaker 3>a baseball,</v>

2842
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:06.880
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was huge and uh,</v>

2843
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:08.570
<v Speaker 3>the stem was about that big,</v>

2844
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:09.800
<v Speaker 3>which was about the size of,</v>

2845
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:10.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2846
01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 3>and and thick.</v>

2847
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 3>It was like a huge,</v>

2848
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:14.294
<v Speaker 3>chunky fat.</v>

2849
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen mushrooms that I thought they weren't real.</v>

2850
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought they were like,</v>

2851
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 3>they picked the wrong kind and it wasn't going to work because there were so</v>

2852
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:21.230
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

2853
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.760
<v Speaker 3>there was no way to really judge it.</v>

2854
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:23.780
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just like fuck.</v>

2855
01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.790
<v Speaker 3>And a half of it I was,</v>

2856
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 3>it was the dumbest thing ever.</v>

2857
01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

2858
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2859
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.221
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2860
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:28.641
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2861
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I want to see a lot of crazy shit.</v>

2862
01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to go deep this time.</v>

2863
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:33.400
<v Speaker 3>And so I made team a girl from a,</v>

2864
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2865
01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:36.171
<v Speaker 3>with the mushrooms.</v>

2866
01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 3>We both made money.</v>

2867
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 3>We both made our own separate t so we both had about a quarter each and each one</v>

2868
01:18:41.031 --> 01:18:41.864
<v Speaker 3>of our teas.</v>

2869
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 3>And she only drank half of it because she started feeling it halfway through the</v>

2870
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 3>tea,</v>

2871
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.881
<v Speaker 3>drinking the tea.</v>

2872
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

2873
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:47.721
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2874
01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:48.620
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't eat,</v>

2875
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I did it quick and I just ate it and drank the whole thing real quick.</v>

2876
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 3>And then we're both laying on the couch and my body starts twitching.</v>

2877
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Like immediately I had all these twitches over my body,</v>

2878
01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:00.020
<v Speaker 3>like it was twitching.</v>

2879
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.161
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2880
01:19:01.161 --> 01:19:03.470
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I'm rumblings of the universe coming.</v>

2881
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2882
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I had eight today,</v>

2883
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:07.130
<v Speaker 3>cause that's another thing in solving that we had eight before.</v>

2884
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.950
<v Speaker 3>So the only thing I eat today that day was at beet salad.</v>

2885
01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 3>That's how you're supposed to do it,</v>

2886
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2887
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:13.200
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to fast for 12 hours.</v>

2888
01:19:13.201 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 3>So I had a small beat sound like seriously small beats out.</v>

2889
01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:20.890
<v Speaker 3>So I'm laying on the couch and suddenly I looked at my hand and it would turned</v>

2890
01:19:20.891 --> 01:19:21.860
<v Speaker 3>into triangles,</v>

2891
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:22.820
<v Speaker 3>pyramids.</v>

2892
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't see my fingers,</v>

2893
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 3>there were just tons,</v>

2894
01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 3>a little pyramids.</v>

2895
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked to the ground dual geometric patterns.</v>

2896
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 3>And I've always had in the past,</v>

2897
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:32.420
<v Speaker 3>whenever I was swimming,</v>

2898
01:19:32.421 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I knew where I was.</v>

2899
01:19:33.321 --> 01:19:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I looked around and I saw the room.</v>

2900
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was my room,</v>

2901
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 3>but it just look trippy.</v>

2902
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.061
<v Speaker 3>This was like,</v>

2903
01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:38.361
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2904
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 3>I was not seeing anything that looked familiar.</v>

2905
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:44.630
<v Speaker 3>It was like pyramids and gears and,</v>

2906
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2907
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.650
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2908
01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:46.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2909
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:49.200
<v Speaker 3>a lot of clock tower type things like inside a clock where it has all this,</v>

2910
01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 3>the gears and stuff.</v>

2911
01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:53.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like you seeing the inner workings of the universe.</v>

2912
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 3>And so me and my girlfriend both fucked up as hell.</v>

2913
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:56.601
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

2914
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:56.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2915
01:19:56.811 --> 01:20:00.240
<v Speaker 3>let's go upstairs and lay in your bed and just chill out and look at things that</v>

2916
01:20:00.241 --> 01:20:01.074
<v Speaker 3>you get upstairs.</v>

2917
01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2918
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 3>I fell to the ground four times while walking up to the stairs.</v>

2919
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:07.220
<v Speaker 3>My feet would not work anymore.</v>

2920
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.600
<v Speaker 3>My legs just would not work and you're supposed to be lying down yet.</v>

2921
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 3>So I laid down and it started smelling like dog pee where I was laying,</v>

2922
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:13.841
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

2923
01:20:13.841 --> 01:20:17.590
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to crawl and so it's trying to crawl.</v>

2924
01:20:17.591 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>So I somehow got in bed and I'm looking at what was the ceiling fan.</v>

2925
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:24.000
<v Speaker 3>But to me it was just a spinning vibe,</v>

2926
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:24.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2927
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.740
<v Speaker 3>like black hole,</v>

2928
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:27.180
<v Speaker 3>like fucking of colors.</v>

2929
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 3>And I did,</v>

2930
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was dead.</v>

2931
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2932
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.593
<v Speaker 3>I am dead.</v>

2933
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:32.850
<v Speaker 3>And then I just started getting really sick,</v>

2934
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2935
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:33.810
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2936
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 3>like a poisoned sick.</v>

2937
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.331
<v Speaker 3>And so then I was like,</v>

2938
01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2939
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.673
<v Speaker 3>I gotta Puke.</v>

2940
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:37.951
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2941
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:38.551
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to Puke.</v>

2942
01:20:38.551 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I tried not to make myself puke.</v>

2943
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Finally I get up,</v>

2944
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:42.570
<v Speaker 3>ran to the bathroom south,</v>

2945
01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.400
<v Speaker 3>fell on the ground to Arenda bathroom,</v>

2946
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 3>puked my Puke,</v>

2947
01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 3>turn into what was beets turned into this red,</v>

2948
01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 3>furry,</v>

2949
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 3>a tree that came out and was just shooting lasers and stuff.</v>

2950
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:56.130
<v Speaker 3>And so I started recording myself trying to find my phone and I couldn't even</v>

2951
01:20:56.131 --> 01:20:56.881
<v Speaker 3>use my phone.</v>

2952
01:20:56.881 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 3>So like it took me maybe a half hour to find out how to use my phone because the</v>

2953
01:21:00.661 --> 01:21:02.640
<v Speaker 3>phone was just a big kaleidoscope of Shit,</v>

2954
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.833
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2955
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly it all stopped and I was like,</v>

2956
01:21:06.181 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was that?</v>

2957
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:07.914
<v Speaker 3>I feel normal.</v>

2958
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anything and everything.</v>

2959
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.450
<v Speaker 3>And so it just immediately right back into the world.</v>

2960
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.553
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

2961
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2962
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>

2963
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had a poison.</v>

2964
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had died.</v>

2965
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.460
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what's going on.</v>

2966
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.900
<v Speaker 3>But girlfriend was laying in bed just seeing all the same shit,</v>

2967
01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 3>not feeling she was diags.</v>

2968
01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.070
<v Speaker 3>You only had half of what I had.</v>

2969
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't puking or anything,</v>

2970
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 3>but I was,</v>

2971
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't stop puking.</v>

2972
01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:30.510
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

2973
01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I had nothing in me.</v>

2974
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what I was puking and I thought I fucking,</v>

2975
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2976
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.261
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating.</v>

2977
01:21:35.261 --> 01:21:37.530
<v Speaker 4>And you talk about the big ones because I've never had big ones.</v>

2978
01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:38.870
<v Speaker 4>I've only had like little ones too.</v>

2979
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 4>But Dennis and Terence Mckenna,</v>

2980
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:46.340
<v Speaker 4>when they were in the Amazon in like the 1970s this is when they started having</v>

2981
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 4>their psychedelic adventures and they would go take the Iowasca and eat the</v>

2982
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:52.530
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms.</v>

2983
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 4>They said the mushrooms are like dinner plates,</v>

2984
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.830
<v Speaker 4>like in the Amazon.</v>

2985
01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:57.390
<v Speaker 4>These motherfuckers grow and they're like,</v>

2986
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2987
01:21:57.930 --> 01:22:00.480
<v Speaker 4>if you grow into a real fertile environment like that,</v>

2988
01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why look at the size of that.</v>

2989
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:03.384
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2990
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Brian's holding one up a picture.</v>

2991
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Once they do that looks like a spaceship and then yeah,</v>

2992
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.003
<v Speaker 4>look inside of it.</v>

2993
01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Then on it looks like a fucking like,</v>

2994
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:11.031
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2995
01:22:11.031 --> 01:22:14.180
<v Speaker 3>like a whale or sperm or an idea</v>

2996
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:14.581
<v Speaker 4>ball.</v>

2997
01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense that those big ones would be even stronger.</v>

2998
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Like what if they're stronger?</v>

2999
01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 4>Poor ounce as well.</v>

3000
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:21.970
<v Speaker 4>But then when I was going to say is dance,</v>

3001
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Mckenna went crazy for like two weeks.</v>

3002
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 4>He had some sort of a schizophrenia episode from,</v>

3003
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 4>from the mushrooms and lost his marbles and it was like gone for two weeks.</v>

3004
01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what happened or what.</v>

3005
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 4>They don't know exactly what you mean.</v>

3006
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He eventually came back,</v>

3007
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:38.880
<v Speaker 4>but he was apparently just gone for like the longest time.</v>

3008
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.020
<v Speaker 4>That's some scary shit.</v>

3009
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:41.290
<v Speaker 3>That was scary.</v>

3010
01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 3>It was four hours of being inside of a Salvia or a DMT trip and not a bathroom,</v>

3011
01:22:47.321 --> 01:22:50.590
<v Speaker 3>which I thought where I was at and my girlfriend sent out.</v>

3012
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.140
<v Speaker 3>She would walk in and I would be sitting like Buddha,</v>

3013
01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.770
<v Speaker 3>like legs cross facing the wall like two inches from a wall.</v>

3014
01:22:56.771 --> 01:23:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Just staring at it with my eyes open and that I would look at her and my eyes</v>

3015
01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 3>would be cross side and then like I would turn back towards the wall and says,</v>

3016
01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>she's</v>

3017
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3018
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what she's like,</v>

3019
01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were mad.</v>

3020
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:09.101
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3021
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you were just sitting there facing a wall or something.</v>

3022
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what the fuck that was about,</v>

3023
01:23:15.011 --> 01:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't.</v>

3024
01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>You had what's called a breakthrough experience.</v>

3025
01:23:18.131 --> 01:23:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You have with all those psychedelic freaks.</v>

3026
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>All really want to see,</v>

3027
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3028
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:23.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people will talk about,</v>

3029
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 1>they like to do mushrooms,</v>

3030
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 1>but they never really have done mushrooms.</v>

3031
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't really do mushrooms until you see what you saw.</v>

3032
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>What you did is have the full blown experience.</v>

3033
01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why people talk about like why do you make such a</v>

3034
01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:35.621
<v Speaker 1>big deal?</v>

3035
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll say to me like,</v>

3036
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 1>why do you make such a big deal about mushrooms?</v>

3037
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Why do you make big deal about DMT or the psychedelic experience?</v>

3038
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:41.371
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

3039
01:23:41.371 --> 01:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>why do you make such a big deal out of it?</v>

3040
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So infant tile,</v>

3041
01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:43.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3042
01:23:43.901 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I make a big deal about it because to me it is a big deal.</v>

3043
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:47.950
<v Speaker 1>What I've experienced,</v>

3044
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 1>especially DMT,</v>

3045
01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's impossible.</v>

3046
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It is impossible and it's impossibly beautiful and it's impossibly wise.</v>

3047
01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 1>And after it's over,</v>

3048
01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a better person.</v>

3049
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I learned something and I come back better and nicer and improved</v>

3050
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:04.510
<v Speaker 1>and more enlightened.</v>

3051
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:04.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3052
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 1>it sounds ridiculous.</v>

3053
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:06.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3054
01:24:06.411 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm agreeing with you.</v>

3055
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous here in my own voice,</v>

3056
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:09.971
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>

3057
01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:10.990
<v Speaker 1>that shit is important.</v>

3058
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what you did,</v>

3059
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:12.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3060
01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know exactly how much to take and what if there was a sham and what</v>

3061
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 1>if there was a center where you could go to and there's some fucking,</v>

3062
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3063
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.790
<v Speaker 1>place in Malibu and there's some fucking people that have been doing it forever.</v>

3064
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And Joey Diaz greets you at the door,</v>

3065
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>come on and got soccer.</v>

3066
01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:24.750
<v Speaker 1>We've got a room,</v>

3067
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Voya,</v>

3068
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:28.060
<v Speaker 1>he's got his robot and he takes you to the place and everybody does it</v>

3069
01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

3070
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:30.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what a beautiful world we could live in,</v>

3071
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3072
01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what I,</v>

3073
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I started fucking with that shit when I was younger and that was from the east</v>

3074
01:24:35.801 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 1>coast.</v>

3075
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.250
<v Speaker 1>There was no fucking mushrooms.</v>

3076
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 1>But I had these scientists,</v>

3077
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:41.490
<v Speaker 1>kids that were like 30 when I was like 15 and they,</v>

3078
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:45.330
<v Speaker 1>they were scientists that he's Strausberg and every week they were into all this</v>

3079
01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:48.880
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic and Syd Barrett and all this shit.</v>

3080
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And it would make stuff.</v>

3081
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And I gotta be honest with you,</v>

3082
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:52.960
<v Speaker 1>when I first started fucking around with acid,</v>

3083
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 1>to me it was just another way of getting fucked up,</v>

3084
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:56.703
<v Speaker 1>killing the pain.</v>

3085
01:24:57.150 --> 01:25:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Because I started doing acid before my mom died and I started triple like I</v>

3086
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:04.690
<v Speaker 1>remember the trip and could well people don't know is you found your mom dad was</v>

3087
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 1>dad and I was on the way down.</v>

3088
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.870
<v Speaker 1>But what's really fucked up was that that was just amazing.</v>

3089
01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3090
01:25:11.741 --> 01:25:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I started doing acid for the same reasons that everybody else.</v>

3091
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even learn about hallucinogenics and the alt button until you use</v>

3092
01:25:19.811 --> 01:25:20.644
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

3093
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when I did window pane in the eighth grade,</v>

3094
01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I went to see the stones.</v>

3095
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I was mind boggling.</v>

3096
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:26.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by the alt button?</v>

3097
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3098
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you made a very,</v>

3099
01:25:28.451 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 1>you made one of the best ever,</v>

3100
01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3101
01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.253
<v Speaker 1>correlations.</v>

3102
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.620
<v Speaker 1>He said that doing DMT is like pressing the alt and delete,</v>

3103
01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:36.641
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

3104
01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:36.820
<v Speaker 1>alt,</v>

3105
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:37.480
<v Speaker 1>delete,</v>

3106
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:37.811
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

3107
01:25:37.811 --> 01:25:37.991
<v Speaker 1>alt,</v>

3108
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:38.350
<v Speaker 1>delete.</v>

3109
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like rebooting.</v>

3110
01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like we blew the world.</v>

3111
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And I remember being a kid and not just doing it to be high.</v>

3112
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And then after my mother died and you know that you use when buying them,</v>

3113
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:47.741
<v Speaker 1>even six months,</v>

3114
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I started selling microdot acid and every weekend pick up a different 500 hits</v>

3115
01:25:52.061 --> 01:25:52.370
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

3116
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Dell a four way acid.</v>

3117
01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I pick up and these guys were great.</v>

3118
01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what they did.</v>

3119
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.303
<v Speaker 1>They trip,</v>

3120
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:58.450
<v Speaker 1>they tripped the right way.</v>

3121
01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.140
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

3122
01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.610
<v Speaker 1>they would take sheets for a weekend and go camping and you know,</v>

3123
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I would be petrified of the staying</v>

3124
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 5>out in the fucking louvers for three days.</v>

3125
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:06.471
<v Speaker 5>That one,</v>

3126
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 5>they listen to led Zeppelin and I mean it was crazy,</v>

3127
01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 5>but that way eggs in campfire,</v>

3128
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.290
<v Speaker 5>they would fucking cook and trip.</v>

3129
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.071
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't me.</v>

3130
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 5>Like they had no hundred hits.</v>

3131
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:15.590
<v Speaker 5>One time for him.</v>

3132
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.610
<v Speaker 5>Took him in four days and the camping trip and they had the pictures and it was</v>

3133
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:20.121
<v Speaker 5>just great.</v>

3134
01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:20.901
<v Speaker 5>But it wasn't for me.</v>

3135
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:21.734
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't ready.</v>

3136
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 5>But then after my mom died,</v>

3137
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:25.370
<v Speaker 5>I'd go into these a psychosis.</v>

3138
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:25.761
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3139
01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't figure out why an uncle wouldn't talk to me or something.</v>

3140
01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.500
<v Speaker 5>And that night on the way home,</v>

3141
01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 5>I knew that my uncle,</v>

3142
01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:33.490
<v Speaker 5>me always at war when I was like,</v>

3143
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making an example.</v>

3144
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:35.421
<v Speaker 5>There was just a problem.</v>

3145
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a girl didn't like me or you know what killed my mother always had a</v>

3146
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 5>dilemma in my head.</v>

3147
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 5>When you're,</v>

3148
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.770
<v Speaker 5>when you're 16 you always want to know answers.</v>

3149
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 5>And I remember I would take a hit of acid and go home and you know,</v>

3150
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:51.730
<v Speaker 5>fucking come tripping like one had been a junior in high school or sophomore,</v>

3151
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 5>but I knew if I trip on myself,</v>

3152
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 5>that's when I got the full effect and have to go home and take a fucking,</v>

3153
01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.480
<v Speaker 5>he had a window pane or fall away acid and I get speakers and I listened to like</v>

3154
01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:05.390
<v Speaker 5>black sabbath sabotage or master reality,</v>

3155
01:27:05.391 --> 01:27:07.430
<v Speaker 5>which just blows you out of the fucking water.</v>

3156
01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:08.430
<v Speaker 5>And I would,</v>

3157
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 5>and at the end of the night,</v>

3158
01:27:09.411 --> 01:27:10.141
<v Speaker 5>whatever prom,</v>

3159
01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:12.670
<v Speaker 5>my hat or whatever inner problem I was thinking about,</v>

3160
01:27:12.730 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 5>that was really in a way,</v>

3161
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean it'd be gone or solved.</v>

3162
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:18.710
<v Speaker 5>It sued over right?</v>

3163
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 5>It was Susie.</v>

3164
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:19.791
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3165
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:20.091
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3166
01:27:20.091 --> 01:27:21.880
<v Speaker 5>At least now I knew where I stood.</v>

3167
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think that's why I want so many problem kids,</v>

3168
01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:25.910
<v Speaker 5>so many troubled kids have this deep,</v>

3169
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 5>deep connection to music,</v>

3170
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3171
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:28.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3172
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 5>how many kids do you see that are just all fucked up?</v>

3173
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 5>And they got long,</v>

3174
01:27:31.701 --> 01:27:32.930
<v Speaker 5>crazy greasy hair,</v>

3175
01:27:32.931 --> 01:27:35.480
<v Speaker 5>but they got a shirt on if their favorite band,</v>

3176
01:27:35.481 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 5>they're headed to that concert and their fucking life depends on this show being</v>

3177
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:40.550
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

3178
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:41.320
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3179
01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:41.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3180
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about like some really fucking dark and depressed people,</v>

3181
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.630
<v Speaker 5>but they loved their music man.</v>

3182
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:48.231
<v Speaker 5>Very funny.</v>

3183
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:49.460
<v Speaker 5>When we were in Philadelphia,</v>

3184
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.480
<v Speaker 5>a kid I hadn't been at the bitter end came up to me.</v>

3185
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.680
<v Speaker 5>What's the bitter end had been around?</v>

3186
01:27:53.681 --> 01:27:54.411
<v Speaker 5>It was a rock club.</v>

3187
01:27:54.411 --> 01:27:55.244
<v Speaker 5>I did a rock club.</v>

3188
01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 5>You did that in New York.</v>

3189
01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:56.881
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3190
01:27:56.881 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 5>And if he came to my neighbor and he brought me a joint and he,</v>

3191
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:00.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3192
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:01.311
<v Speaker 5>he brought me to join.</v>

3193
01:28:01.311 --> 01:28:02.121
<v Speaker 5>He was very nice.</v>

3194
01:28:02.121 --> 01:28:02.770
<v Speaker 5>And then Phil,</v>

3195
01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:03.770
<v Speaker 5>he came with his other friend,</v>

3196
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 5>he drove from New York City.</v>

3197
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 5>They go like Nyu and he came up to me and he said to me,</v>

3198
01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:08.391
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

3199
01:28:08.391 --> 01:28:09.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of doing mushrooms,</v>

3200
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 5>ash,</v>

3201
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.873
<v Speaker 5>which should I do?</v>

3202
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.000
<v Speaker 5>And I want him to fucking reach over and smack them.</v>

3203
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.791
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3204
01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 5>in my mind I'm like,</v>

3205
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:14.811
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

3206
01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:16.730
<v Speaker 5>that loss that you want to ask me,</v>

3207
01:28:16.731 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck to do?</v>

3208
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:17.961
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3209
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:18.591
<v Speaker 5>if he's a yard,</v>

3210
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

3211
01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:19.430
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

3212
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 5>one of the story was 19 point okay,</v>

3213
01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 5>so I fucking talked about it and then I emailed them,</v>

3214
01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 5>we emailed each other and I really thought about it his age and stuff.</v>

3215
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:32.300
<v Speaker 5>And then I thought about when I was 16 and I had no answers.</v>

3216
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.320
<v Speaker 5>I had no answers.</v>

3217
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:34.340
<v Speaker 5>I had no mother,</v>

3218
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:35.181
<v Speaker 5>no father,</v>

3219
01:28:35.181 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 5>no social security check and all that one.</v>

3220
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:38.151
<v Speaker 5>It was answers.</v>

3221
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 5>All I wanted was help and I remember that at all.</v>

3222
01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 5>I would get my help was was listening to black sabbath,</v>

3223
01:28:43.410 --> 01:28:44.360
<v Speaker 5>doing a hit of acid,</v>

3224
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.650
<v Speaker 5>listened to music.</v>

3225
01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:46.431
<v Speaker 5>It always sued me.</v>

3226
01:28:46.431 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 5>I always thought I had a connection,</v>

3227
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:52.601
<v Speaker 5>but I was he asthma when I was walking the 30 years after the blizzard of Oz was</v>

3228
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:53.930
<v Speaker 5>on VH one yesterday.</v>

3229
01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Tremendous about how he left Sabbath and opens up this bandwidth is Randy Rhoads</v>

3230
01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.481
<v Speaker 5>and no songs.</v>

3231
01:28:59.481 --> 01:29:00.051
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>

3232
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:01.440
<v Speaker 5>They were dumb fucking songs.</v>

3233
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:02.274
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a fuck?</v>

3234
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 5>Some of them,</v>

3235
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:06.270
<v Speaker 5>but they made me go through at that period of my life.</v>

3236
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.620
<v Speaker 5>So what differences are making when people watch this podcast,</v>

3237
01:29:09.621 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 5>who they listened to this podcast.</v>

3238
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:12.001
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

3239
01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:12.211
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

3240
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:14.010
<v Speaker 5>We feel the same void for some people.</v>

3241
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.620
<v Speaker 5>And I'm telling you this,</v>

3242
01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:16.441
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know this.</v>

3243
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how responsible you are when you do this.</v>

3244
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 5>When you talk and you say certain things about your feelings and your emotions,</v>

3245
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 5>people jump onto you because they feel your pain or their admiration or their</v>

3246
01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:28.680
<v Speaker 5>happiness and all the sudden you become a part of them and they become a part of</v>

3247
01:29:28.681 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 5>the human because that's what happened to me.</v>

3248
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 5>As stupid as this may sound,</v>

3249
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.753
<v Speaker 5>you've known it.</v>

3250
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 5>You had martial arts,</v>

3251
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:35.160
<v Speaker 5>your escape when you were a kid.</v>

3252
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 5>We all have to have some fuck of escape when you're a kid,</v>

3253
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:40.950
<v Speaker 5>especially when you don't come from the fucking Brady bunch you're doing.</v>

3254
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 5>I think that one of the things that helps people with this podcast too,</v>

3255
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.250
<v Speaker 5>and I get a lot of emails and Twitter,</v>

3256

01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:02.071
<v Speaker 3>I just thought,</v>

3686
01:40:02.071 --> 01:40:02.281
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3687
01:40:02.281 --> 01:40:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna call Alison up.</v>

3688
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So she comes over and we have Carlos on.</v>

3689
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.590
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why we had Carlos on his,</v>

3690
01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:10.860
<v Speaker 3>because he was one of the guys responsible making this thing called,</v>

3691
01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:11.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3692
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:14.970
<v Speaker 3>the mostly normal show presents the outing of a joke thief.</v>

3693
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.480
<v Speaker 3>See what happened is this,</v>

3694
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.210
<v Speaker 3>there's this guy that we had talked about and they,</v>

3695
01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Mitch,</v>

3696
01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Mitch [inaudible],</v>

3697
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Mitch [inaudible],</v>

3698
01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:22.680
<v Speaker 3>he's a really nice guy who died a few years back.</v>

3699
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:24.061
<v Speaker 3>He said this,</v>

3700
01:40:24.061 --> 01:40:24.780
<v Speaker 3>he died.</v>

3701
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.613
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3702
01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.680
<v Speaker 3>this guy has taken his act joke by joke and it wasn't even like,</v>

3703
01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:32.430
<v Speaker 3>he just took the joke out of it.</v>

3704
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:37.530
<v Speaker 3>He actually watched a video of it and memorized how the guy did it.</v>

3705
01:40:37.670 --> 01:40:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3706
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:39.240
<v Speaker 3>like almost like an actor.</v>

3707
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 3>It's so creepy to watch.</v>

3708
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:41.880
<v Speaker 3>So these guys,</v>

3709
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3710
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:43.010
<v Speaker 3>they kind of,</v>

3711
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.400
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

3712
01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.690
<v Speaker 4>I I see where this is going.</v>

3713
01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.130
<v Speaker 4>I would rather not play this on the show.</v>

3714
01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:46.451
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

3715
01:40:46.451 --> 01:40:47.150
<v Speaker 3>we won't play that.</v>

3716
01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:47.801
<v Speaker 3>People can check it out.</v>

3717
01:40:47.801 --> 01:40:49.450
<v Speaker 3>But this is how crazy this is.</v>

3718
01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3719
01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3720
01:40:50.290 --> 01:40:54.030
<v Speaker 3>the video is identical from the two like sure.</v>

3721
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it's crazy.</v>

3722
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.600
<v Speaker 3>But the weird thing is,</v>

3723
01:40:55.601 --> 01:40:56.980
<v Speaker 3>remember when Alison was on,</v>

3724
01:40:56.981 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 3>and we had talked about being a open mic comic and how a lot of these guys are</v>

3725
01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 3>doing these tricks and one of the things that Allison was talking about is how</v>

3726
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 3>this guy wanted her to pay $100 in order to do five minutes in the belly ring</v>

3727
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>belly room.</v>

3728
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>And she was going to do that because she thought that's what you had to do to be</v>

3729
01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 3>an open mic comic hundred dollars.</v>

3730
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 3>This guy was scamming her,</v>

3731
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:21.580
<v Speaker 3>found out that during that episode of the Salvia video found out this is the</v>

3732
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:22.241
<v Speaker 3>same guy,</v>

3733
01:41:22.241 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 3>that joke thief guy that was scamming her add money and other open comics out of</v>

3734
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:27.004
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

3735
01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.630
<v Speaker 5>She paid a hundred girls sucking my dick and giving me cope from Julie.</v>

3736
01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:32.340
<v Speaker 5>You think I'm fucking kidding you?</v>

3737
01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:32.791

3744
01:41:41.850 --> 01:41:45.510
<v Speaker 5>I had this little blind open mic check dog that used to come up to the comedy</v>

3772
01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.790
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to watch it because Mitch was a friend of mine.</v>

3773
01:42:34.791 --> 01:42:35.624
<v Speaker 4>He was a nice guy.</v>

3774
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Poor fuck.</v>

3775
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:41.810
<v Speaker 4>What this guy is is just some guy who thinks he can slither into this world.</v>

3776
01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:42.381
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3777
01:42:42.381 --> 01:42:45.120
<v Speaker 4>it's like we were talking about earlier this comics and then this people who</v>

3778
01:42:45.121 --> 01:42:47.270
<v Speaker 4>think they could figure out a way to be a comic,</v>

3779
01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3780
01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:48.411
<v Speaker 4>let me look.</v>

3781
01:42:48.411 --> 01:42:51.380
<v Speaker 4>We all want to be's were all want to in the beginning,</v>

3782
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:54.980
<v Speaker 4>but eventually you either embrace the art form or you don't.</v>

3783
01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Everybody in the beginning is a fraud.</v>

3784
01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:59.420
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is in the beginning is pretending you're make believing you're a</v>

3785
01:42:59.421 --> 01:43:02.240
<v Speaker 4>comedian and some people think that this is the way to do it.</v>

3786
01:43:02.241 --> 01:43:02.901
<v Speaker 4>This guy's an idiot.</v>

3787
01:43:02.901 --> 01:43:03.470
<v Speaker 4>He's probably been,</v>

3788
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:05.060
<v Speaker 4>you hear about the hundred dollars thing.</v>

3789
01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:06.890
<v Speaker 4>He's probably been running his whole life like that.</v>

3790
01:43:06.891 --> 01:43:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Just one scan.</v>

3791
01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:11.240
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have asked for $100 a blow job is legit.</v>

3792
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:12.590
<v Speaker 5>That's known.</v>

3793
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:13.111
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3794
01:43:13.111 --> 01:43:13.944
<v Speaker 5>And that's right.</v>

3795
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.040
<v Speaker 5>A blow job in the hundred dollars is bad,</v>

3796
01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:16.371
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3797
01:43:16.371 --> 01:43:16.971
<v Speaker 5>When you shoot it,</v>

3798
01:43:16.971 --> 01:43:18.020
<v Speaker 5>I am become death.</v>

3799
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.510
<v Speaker 5>If you strongly believe by sucking a Dick,</v>

3800
01:43:20.511 --> 01:43:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get onstage.</v>

3801
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:22.663
<v Speaker 5>Shame on you.</v>

3802
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.650
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes if they buy it,</v>

3803
01:43:24.651 --> 01:43:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I got the fucking Russian you,</v>

3804
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:27.710
<v Speaker 5>they did get onstage.</v>

3805
01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:28.251
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying?</v>

3806
01:43:28.251 --> 01:43:30.120
<v Speaker 5>If you believe that's how you got him on stage,</v>

3807
01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:30.650
<v Speaker 5>you suck.</v>

3808
01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:31.520
<v Speaker 5>They suck your Dick.</v>

3809
01:43:31.521 --> 01:43:32.540
<v Speaker 5>You did put them on stage.</v>

3810
01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:33.860
<v Speaker 5>So why wouldn't they believe it?</v>

3811
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:34.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3812
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.761
<v Speaker 5>that's reality.</v>

3813
01:43:34.761 --> 01:43:37.790
<v Speaker 5>Never forget that that blonde girl at first time I told it dog,</v>

3814
01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:38.601
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3815
01:43:38.601 --> 01:43:40.010
<v Speaker 5>she came up on a Friday night.</v>

3816
01:43:40.011 --> 01:43:40.700
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

3817
01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:41.081
<v Speaker 5>Joey,</v>

3818
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:42.150
<v Speaker 5>I know you know people.</v>

3819
01:43:42.151 --> 01:43:42.530
<v Speaker 5>You get me.</v>

3820
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.910
<v Speaker 5>And I looked at straight to the face as a joke and I go,</v>

3821
01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:46.460
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

3823
01:43:47.581 --> 01:43:47.991
<v Speaker 5>I said to,</v>

3824
01:43:47.991 --> 01:43:49.200
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even say Suck Dick to be.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's a freak and then Jane Seymour comes out and says that he's apparently got a</v>

3968
01:47:27.361 --> 01:47:28.650
<v Speaker 4>bunch of little love children.</v>

3969
01:47:29.290 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee he's going to buy eight of them.</v>

3970
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 4>He's just a savage.</v>

3971
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:36.270
<v Speaker 4>He's just shooting those barbarian loads and the women that the ball from the</v>

3972
01:47:36.271 --> 01:47:39.070
<v Speaker 4>seventh I shouldn't make them Germans go cray.</v>

3973
01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.860
<v Speaker 4>That's what killing him to go bananas.</v>

3974
01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:44.140
<v Speaker 4>That people that the ball,</v>

3975
01:47:44.141 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 4>what's not a shift in the 70s I used to just swell your shit up.</v>

3976
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 4>See now they got refined steroids.</v>

3977
01:47:48.811 --> 01:47:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't make you a fucking savage or Arnold was legendary for doing every day.</v>

3978
01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

3979
01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Always talk about whatever everybody,</v>

3980
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 4>anyone who was doing Arnold was taking shit to the next level.</v>

3981
01:47:58.981 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Ball walking.</v>

3982
01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.030
<v Speaker 4>He even shot fucking Lance Armstrong and shit.</v>

3983
01:48:03.031 --> 01:48:03.864
<v Speaker 4>That motherfucker,</v>

3984
01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:04.813
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing,</v>

3985
01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:07.410
<v Speaker 4>you had lance Armstrong suck.</v>

3986
01:48:07.411 --> 01:48:07.831
<v Speaker 4>It lands.</v>

3987
01:48:07.831 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 4>You're doing an old wrong.</v>

3988
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:12.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't even nuts and berries and the designer.</v>

3989
01:48:12.601 --> 01:48:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've ever heard of the nice thing about Lance Armstrong and when I</v>

3990
01:48:16.171 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 4>seen that thing on 60 minutes,</v>

3991
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 4>all I kept thinking about was it couldn't happen to a fucking nice a guy.</v>

3992
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:21.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3993
01:48:21.481 --> 01:48:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you one in Austin,</v>

3994
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 4>when we go to Austin,</v>

3995
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 4>we never hear nothing but shitty things about him.</v>

3996
01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:25.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3997
01:48:25.741 --> 01:48:26.101
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't.</v>

3998
01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:27.450
<v Speaker 4>I've heard this weird man.</v>

3999
01:48:28.190 --> 01:48:29.730
<v Speaker 4>He did something to somebody I know in La,</v>

4000
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:31.080
<v Speaker 4>something shitty at a restaurant.</v>

4001
01:48:31.081 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Something happened.</v>

4002
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 4>You talked to the Lord,</v>

4003
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 4>the wrong people.</v>

4004
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:35.520
<v Speaker 4>You can get shitty stories about the nicest people.</v>

4005
01:48:35.521 --> 01:48:35.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4006
01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I bet up somewhere out there,</v>

4007
01:48:36.661 --> 01:48:37.494
<v Speaker 4>Henry Winkler,</v>

4008
01:48:37.530 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 4>there's some asshole shitty Henry Winkler story.</v>

4009
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:41.820
<v Speaker 4>It's just if you deal with sheer numbers,</v>

4010
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.571
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4011
01:48:42.571 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 4>if you do like most people you talk to and they say,</v>

4012
01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:45.181
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4013
01:48:45.181 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 4>I met Randy coture.</v>

4014
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I such a nice guy,</v>

4015
01:48:47.221 --> 01:48:47.491
<v Speaker 4>isn't he?</v>

4016
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Like most people will tell you that,</v>

4017
01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:49.651
<v Speaker 4>but he a few.</v>

4018
01:48:49.651 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then you get some one dude that was probably annoying as fuck and</v>

4019
01:48:52.770 --> 01:48:55.580
<v Speaker 4>came up to Randy and tried to get him in a headlock by picture when you're at</v>

4020
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 4>the restaurant,</v>

4021
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.221
<v Speaker 4>interrupted him.</v>

4022
01:48:57.221 --> 01:48:59.370
<v Speaker 4>I was eating dinner or something and whatever the fuck it was.</v>

4023
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.260
<v Speaker 4>And so then you'll get a shitty Randy coture story.</v>

4024
01:49:01.261 --> 01:49:05.550
<v Speaker 4>But I never heard a good Lance Armstrong story every time you were in Austin.</v>

4025
01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:05.950
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard,</v>

4026
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:09.100
<v Speaker 4>but we were all hearing it from waiters and waitresses and yeah,</v>

4027
01:49:09.101 --> 01:49:11.670
<v Speaker 4>and people that know people that ran into him.</v>

4028
01:49:11.671 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 4>It was never good.</v>

4029
01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4030
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 4>to be that dude to be a one dude who pretends that he's the one who wasn't doing</v>

4031
01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:21.200
<v Speaker 4>shit when everyone else is doing.</v>

4032
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:22.050
<v Speaker 4>I love that shit.</v>

4033
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 4>I love when they get nailed.</v>

4034
01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Don't have some fucking dignity.</v>

4035
01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Be a fucking man.</v>

4036
01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:26.041
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

4037
01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:26.731
<v Speaker 4>he don't know.</v>

4038
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:28.350
<v Speaker 4>He wants to stand behind the paperwork.</v>

4039
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Yes and no because there's a big business behind all this k and there's a lot of</v>

4040
01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:36.150
<v Speaker 4>people that knew he was doing things is one of the things in the 60 minutes</v>

4041
01:49:36.151 --> 01:49:37.260
<v Speaker 4>documentary about it,</v>

4042
01:49:37.261 --> 01:49:38.400
<v Speaker 4>the 60 minutes coverage of it.</v>

4043
01:49:38.610 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 4>They say that he tested positive for EPO at one point in time and then after he</v>

4044
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:44.011
<v Speaker 4>tested positive,</v>

4045
01:49:44.011 --> 01:49:46.020
<v Speaker 4>he donated money to this,</v>

4046
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:51.140
<v Speaker 4>this blood scanning foundation that bus people for for fucking testing positive</v>

4047
01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:52.000
<v Speaker 4>for shit.</v>

4048
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 4>He don't even like 25 grand and then he donated another hundred grand in the</v>

4049
01:49:55.481 --> 01:49:55.760
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

4050
01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:56.540
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

4051
01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 4>But you mean that's a payoff man.</v>

4052
01:49:58.121 --> 01:49:59.360
<v Speaker 4>That's like a direction shit.</v>

4053
01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.260
<v Speaker 4>This guy was really doing EPO and all the other dudes,</v>

4054
01:50:02.261 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 4>they're busting them left and right.</v>

4055
01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 4>They all have to,</v>

4056
01:50:04.670 --> 01:50:07.720
<v Speaker 4>they all have to come clean and they have to tell only the truth.</v>

4057
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Cause if they get caught with anything then their immunity goes out the window.</v>

4058
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 4>So they give him a limited amount of immunity.</v>

4059
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.370
<v Speaker 4>We tell them we want to know every fucking thing that happened.</v>

4060
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:17.140
<v Speaker 4>And if you lie about one thing,</v>

4061
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 4>you're going to jail,</v>

4062
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 4>your immunities gone.</v>

4063
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:21.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to jail for everything you've already admitted to.</v>

4064
01:50:21.251 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 4>So that 25 fucking years you believe that shouldn't go steroids.</v>

4065
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:29.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry because I made a joke and I got plenty for the five emails from</v>

4066
01:50:29.111 --> 01:50:29.590
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

4067
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:30.460
<v Speaker 4>Hey fat ass.</v>

4068
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't doing steroids,</v>

4069
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.670
<v Speaker 4>he was doing tests or whatever.</v>

4070
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:34.780
<v Speaker 5>You know what bitch,</v>

4071
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:35.710
<v Speaker 5>he was still cheap.</v>

4072
01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 5>That's like me telling you I wasn't doing heroin.</v>

4073
01:50:38.141 --> 01:50:38.974
<v Speaker 5>I was doing though.</v>

4074
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:40.300
<v Speaker 5>It's the same fucking different.</v>

4075
01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I think they all do it though.</v>

4076
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I think in that sport.</v>

4077
01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:44.820
<v Speaker 4>I think in that sport they have to,</v>

4078
01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:45.541
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

4079
01:50:45.541 --> 01:50:46.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4080
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4081
01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:48.180
<v Speaker 4>they test you and you're not supposed to do it,</v>

4082
01:50:48.181 --> 01:50:48.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4083
01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:48.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4084
01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:48.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4085
01:50:48.991 --> 01:50:52.230
<v Speaker 4>And then they'd blood dope as well instead of taking just the EPO,</v>

4086
01:50:52.231 --> 01:50:53.160
<v Speaker 4>they blood dope dope.</v>

4087
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.120
<v Speaker 4>And there,</v>

4088
01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:54.480
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4089
01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.380
<v Speaker 4>that's a fact.</v>

4090
01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:55.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4091
01:50:55.651 --> 01:50:55.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4092
01:50:55.851 --> 01:50:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

4093
01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:56.881
<v Speaker 4>they've been doing that.</v>

4094
01:50:56.881 --> 01:50:58.170
<v Speaker 4>He can't catch people.</v>

4095
01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:02.270
<v Speaker 5>We have it right in the wrong sometimes in life is sometimes for fucking riding</v>

4096
01:51:02.271 --> 01:51:02.671
<v Speaker 5>a bike.</v>

4097
01:51:02.671 --> 01:51:03.540
<v Speaker 5>You gotta do this shit.</v>

4098
01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:05.340
<v Speaker 5>This guy was said somewhere,</v>

4099
01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:06.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4100
01:51:06.361 --> 01:51:09.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they should arrest Barry bonds now after he retired two years ago.</v>

4101
01:51:09.751 --> 01:51:11.340
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm breaking his balls.</v>

4102
01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:12.140
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

4103
01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:13.470
<v Speaker 5>And when did they get Barry bonds on?</v>

4104
01:51:13.471 --> 01:51:14.970
<v Speaker 5>They got him on some real minor shit.</v>

4105
01:51:14.971 --> 01:51:15.571
<v Speaker 5>Like lying.</v>

4106
01:51:15.571 --> 01:51:15.781

<v Speaker 5>I got 19 fucking sponsorships for right.</v>

4119
01:51:28.650 --> 01:51:30.000
<v Speaker 5>One of them is a Catholic church.</v>

4120
01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:32.490
<v Speaker 5>You want it all Christian Church and the other one's gate array.</v>

4121
01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:34.950
<v Speaker 5>You want to ask me if I do steroids on a fucking camera?</v>

4122
01:51:34.951 --> 01:51:35.790
<v Speaker 5>What do you want me to tell you?</v>

4123
01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:36.871
<v Speaker 5>What are you want me to tell you?</v>

4124
01:51:36.871 --> 01:51:38.220
<v Speaker 5>I've got millions of fucking stake here.</v>

4125
01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:39.063
<v Speaker 5>What do you want me to tell you?</v>

4126
01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:40.050
<v Speaker 5>It's not perjury.</v>

4127
01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:40.651
<v Speaker 5>We did it.</v>

4128
01:51:40.651 --> 01:51:41.940
<v Speaker 5>You don't want me in the hall of fame?</v>

4129
01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:43.170
<v Speaker 5>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

4130
01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I got a pension and I got money coming,</v>

4131
01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:47.070
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to waste taxpayers' money.</v>

4132
01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.770
<v Speaker 5>Barry Bonds to court.</v>

4133
01:51:49.771 --> 01:51:50.604
<v Speaker 5>Who did he hurt?</v>

4134
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:52.710
<v Speaker 4>It is interesting though,</v>

4135
01:51:52.711 --> 01:51:56.370
<v Speaker 4>because you got to think that if these guys are doing shit that's dangerous for</v>

4136
01:51:56.371 --> 01:51:59.220
<v Speaker 4>their body and you know it is kind of dangerous,</v>

4137
01:51:59.310 --> 01:52:00.690
<v Speaker 4>especially the guys that go deep.</v>

4138
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:02.670
<v Speaker 4>You go the Arnold Schwarzenegger levels,</v>

<v Speaker 4>re those giant fucking dudes.</v>

4142
01:52:07.710 --> 01:52:08.850
<v Speaker 4>That's dangerous as fuck.</v>

4143
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.241
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>

4144
01:52:09.241 --> 01:52:09.511
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4145
01:52:09.511 --> 01:52:10.770
<v Speaker 4>you're really overclocking.</v>

4146
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

4147
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:14.040
<v Speaker 4>60 [inaudible] he's still here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4149
01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:14.600
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

4150
01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.280
<v Speaker 4>For him being he also guys open heart surgery,</v>

4151
01:52:17.281 --> 01:52:17.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4152
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4153
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:18.740
<v Speaker 5>but there's 10 guys that the gun,</v>

4154
01:52:19.130 --> 01:52:19.371
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>

4155
01:52:19.371 --> 01:52:20.490
<v Speaker 5>Every time you listen to it.</v>

4156
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:22.130
<v Speaker 5>Anytime you'd do a bump of cocaine,</v>

4157
01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.270
<v Speaker 5>a mushroom,</v>

4158
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:25.130
<v Speaker 5>a fucking five hour energy,</v>

4159
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:26.151
<v Speaker 5>a steroid,</v>

4160
01:52:26.151 --> 01:52:26.660
<v Speaker 5>you always,</v>

4161
01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you always gone in that area.</v>

4162
01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:31.400
<v Speaker 5>You're always 55th coaching to buy anything.</v>

4163
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:32.420
<v Speaker 5>You're pushing them body.</v>

4164
01:52:32.421 --> 01:52:33.200
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

4165
01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:35.420
<v Speaker 5>maybe 50% 50% of that would do it.</v>

4166
01:52:35.421 --> 01:52:36.110
<v Speaker 5>How many times?</v>

4167
01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.340
<v Speaker 5>I did coke for 30 years.</v>

4168
01:52:37.341 --> 01:52:40.490
<v Speaker 5>The basketball player pushes Boston the line and had a heart attack.</v>

4169
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:41.601
<v Speaker 5>We're all different.</v>

4170
01:52:41.601 --> 01:52:42.421
<v Speaker 5>You say it the best.</v>

4171
01:52:42.421 --> 01:52:43.130
<v Speaker 5>Some guy,</v>

4172
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:44.930
<v Speaker 5>the Georges has a certain number.</v>

4173
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:45.620
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4174
01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>The head</v>

4175
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 1>just has a certain number.</v>

4176
01:52:47.151 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It could be five shots to the head to get brain or it could be a hundred and</v>

4177
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:51.284
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

4178
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>it depends on if you're Samoan.</v>

4179
01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends on anything.</v>

4180
01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that number,</v>

4181
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:59.760
<v Speaker 1>but once you get to the steroids or whatever,</v>

4182
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:00.860
<v Speaker 1>any of that shit.</v>

4183
01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4184
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:02.683
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

4185
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4186
01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:03.531
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

4187
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:04.364
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4188
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm a personal freedom person,</v>

4189
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that man,</v>

4190
01:53:07.431 --> 01:53:08.990
<v Speaker 1>if a kid wants to be a cyclist,</v>

4191
01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't have to take some shit that might give them a stroke.</v>

4192
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to win,</v>

4193
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have a bunch of dudes were an EPO,</v>

4194
01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:16.370
<v Speaker 1>an EPO can give you strokes.</v>

4195
01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people have died from it,</v>

4196
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:21.740
<v Speaker 1>but I assume it's gotta be a few and it is dangerous.</v>

4197
01:53:21.741 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I know people that have told me,</v>

4198
01:53:23.151 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 1>they know people who took it.</v>

4199
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 1>You know the guys that are professional cyclist and they detailed how difficult</v>

4200
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:30.950
<v Speaker 1>and dangerous it was and how they would have to wake up in the middle of the</v>

4201
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:32.120
<v Speaker 1>night and do cardio.</v>

4202
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.060
<v Speaker 1>They would have to get up and go ride their bike because their heart would be</v>

4203
01:53:35.061 --> 01:53:36.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking pounding because their,</v>

4204
01:53:36.281 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>their blood is too thick because they have all this shit in their body that</v>

4205
01:53:39.441 --> 01:53:40.290
<v Speaker 1>makes them make an,</v>

4206
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 1>an abnormal amount of red blood cells.</v>

4207
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 1>So on the plus side you carry all this oxygen.</v>

4208
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:45.621
<v Speaker 1>But on the downside,</v>

4209
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:45.741
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4210
01:53:45.741 --> 01:53:48.320
<v Speaker 1>if you don't work out all the time and you could die,</v>

4211
01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 1>like you could have a fucking stroke man,</v>

4212
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 1>these dudes would,</v>

4213
01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 1>he was a cyclist and he was staying on a,</v>

4214
01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:55.100
<v Speaker 1>on a bus and he said you would hear him at two,</v>

4215
01:53:55.101 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning and you would know who was on EPO cause those are the guys</v>

4216
01:53:58.131 --> 01:53:59.150
<v Speaker 1>who would get up and they would,</v>

4217
01:53:59.151 --> 01:54:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and you would hear their bike,</v>

4218
01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you'd hear them disconnect their bike and go Rodan till three in the morning,</v>

4219
01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4220
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:04.550
<v Speaker 1>they had to do it.</v>

4221
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:05.061
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do it,</v>

4222
01:54:05.061 --> 01:54:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna die.</v>

4223
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So in on one hand,</v>

4224
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe in personal freedom.</v>

4225
01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Then another hand I go,</v>

4226
01:54:09.771 --> 01:54:12.410
<v Speaker 1>well you know you got to let people know what the fuck you're doing.</v>

4227
01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't make it so that the only the guys at the top are taking the shit in</v>

4228
01:54:15.861 --> 01:54:16.850
<v Speaker 1>line about taking it.</v>

4229
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 1>That does become a problem if you say,</v>

4230
01:54:18.831 --> 01:54:19.191
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

4231
01:54:19.191 --> 01:54:19.851
<v Speaker 1>we all take it.</v>

4232
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:20.621
<v Speaker 1>Everybody takes it.</v>

4233
01:54:20.621 --> 01:54:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of the world of cyclists and it's been there forever.</v>

4234
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Then expose light on it and then you've got to figure out what,</v>

4235
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:28.400
<v Speaker 1>if anything you can do about it.</v>

4236
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 1>But it is a dangerous thing.</v>

4237
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:31.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4238
01:54:31.041 --> 01:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4239
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you're telling kids that want to be athletes that they have to do this shit.</v>

4240
01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:35.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4241
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no way around it and be professional sport today there's gotta be</v>

4242
01:54:39.561 --> 01:54:41.960
<v Speaker 1>something involved or supreme genetics.</v>

4243
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.100
<v Speaker 1>You can have a guy like Jon Jones,</v>

4244
01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.990
<v Speaker 1>magnificent genetics and he doesn't need anything.</v>

4245
01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:48.741
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

4246
01:54:48.741 --> 01:54:50.270
<v Speaker 1>there's other guys that are built like that too.</v>

4247
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

4248
01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.060
<v Speaker 1>or similar,</v>

4249
01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4250
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.911
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys,</v>

4251
01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't need anything.</v>

4252
01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.060
<v Speaker 1>They just have awesome genetic,</v>

4253
01:54:55.061 --> 01:54:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you do as long as you're a professional athlete.</v>

4254
01:54:57.471 --> 01:54:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I know the stresses of being a professional athlete,</v>

4255
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:02.160
<v Speaker 1>especially football bat one should there,</v>

4256
01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the pressure is amazing.</v>

4257
01:55:04.191 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Every year that rook and people,</v>

4258
01:55:05.421 --> 01:55:08.100
<v Speaker 1>even in the UFC now watch ramp pays the other night.</v>

4259
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.360
<v Speaker 1>But then you got my man Rick story than other young kid to the company in the</v>

4260
01:55:11.361 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 1>UFC that 20 and a half away,</v>

4261
01:55:13.101 --> 01:55:13.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

4262
01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4263
01:55:14.091 --> 01:55:15.530
<v Speaker 1>people come on every once in a while,</v>

4264
01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:18.830
<v Speaker 1>but also kids had come in that pop that piss hot,</v>

4265
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 1>they get rid of them right away about pissing holiday anything.</v>

4266
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:26.030
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that it's very tough to not want to stay at your sharpest,</v>

4267
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but if you do steroids against what you did,</v>

4268
01:55:28.161 --> 01:55:28.994
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

4269
01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:30.200
<v Speaker 1>there's no way are we tracking them.</v>

4270
01:55:30.201 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So do me a favor.</v>

4271
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Figure out a way that when you make that first fucking statement,</v>

4272
01:55:33.981 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you can edit it instead of dragging off the fucking 10 years.</v>

4273
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:38.271
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to say?</v>

4274
01:55:38.271 --> 01:55:39.140
<v Speaker 1>You got to say nothing.</v>

4275
01:55:39.141 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't hit me with a story that you guys shot him into yarn because I'm too for</v>

4276
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:44.060
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

4277
01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Told me anything but don't tell me that and that's what I'm sick of right now at</v>

4278
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:48.343
<v Speaker 5>this point in my life.</v>

4279
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:49.261
<v Speaker 5>Tell me something.</v>

4280
01:55:49.261 --> 01:55:50.011
<v Speaker 5>Don't hide.</v>

4281
01:55:50.011 --> 01:55:50.844
<v Speaker 5>Don't get the prep.</v>

4282
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.421
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

4283
01:55:51.421 --> 01:55:52.254
<v Speaker 5>You got busted.</v>

4284
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Get the fucking cameras and let's go.</v>

4285
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

4286
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 5>Y'All silver had some nonhuman pis.</v>

4287
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:57.361
<v Speaker 5>Oh please.</v>

4288
01:55:57.361 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm what the fuck the showing up.</v>

4289
01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.450
<v Speaker 5>We're pissed on Brazil.</v>

4290
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:00.090
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Random.</v>

4291
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:01.160
<v Speaker 5>It was the first guy to do that.</v>

4292
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:01.721
<v Speaker 5>Kevin ran one,</v>

4293
01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:02.554
<v Speaker 5>had a rubber Dick.</v>

4294
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:03.420
<v Speaker 5>He used a rubber deck.</v>

4295
01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Any really non human urine.</v>

4296
01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:07.291
<v Speaker 5>Ben,</v>

4297
01:56:07.291 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 5>have you heard anything from him lately?</v>

4298
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 5>He's kind of retired,</v>

4299
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:10.710
<v Speaker 5>fought recently.</v>

4300
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Real recently in the last,</v>

4301
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I love people who think they're going to be the urine test.</v>

4302
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 5>I just want to be great to those fucking clowns.</v>

4303
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:17.880
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Randleman was awesome.</v>

4304
01:56:18.490 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 5>I love those fucking clowns because I was with them.</v>

4305
01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:23.970
<v Speaker 5>I always thought I was a little bit beat the system.</v>

4306
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.380
<v Speaker 5>I used to drink vinegar,</v>

4307
01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:26.851
<v Speaker 5>that would be it.</v>

4308
01:56:26.851 --> 01:56:29.550
<v Speaker 5>So I would snort coke Friday and Saturday night.</v>

4309
01:56:30.210 --> 01:56:31.043
<v Speaker 5>Listen to me,</v>

4310
01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:31.913
<v Speaker 5>listen to me,</v>

4311
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 5>listen to what addiction does or any level.</v>

4312
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:34.770
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4313
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:38.700
<v Speaker 5>I used to do an eight ball on Friday ball on Saturday and then they would have</v>

4314
01:56:38.701 --> 01:56:42.360
<v Speaker 5>to test me on Monday for federal probation or Wednesday or Friday.</v>

4315
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:44.760
<v Speaker 5>I could make the Piss test Wednesday,</v>

4316
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:48.540
<v Speaker 5>but there's no way I can make this rock candy coming out his deck.</v>

4317
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.310
<v Speaker 5>I would fucking vinegar flavored rock candy,</v>

4318
01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:56.040
<v Speaker 5>go and get white distilled vinegar with a bottle of Gatorade and I'd be</v>

4319
01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 5>cranberries,</v>

4320
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:57.743
<v Speaker 5>but be,</v>

4321
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.180
<v Speaker 5>I drink the whole thing of vinegar,</v>

4322
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.010
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing again.</v>

4323
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:02.320
<v Speaker 5>The rape kiss all day come.</v>

4324
01:57:02.321 --> 01:57:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Where did you learn this?</v>

4325
01:57:03.391 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 5>This is the stories on this.</v>

4326
01:57:04.411 --> 01:57:06.850
<v Speaker 5>This is all the analogies you learned from people in your read.</v>

4327
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.310
<v Speaker 5>That time there was no Internet Joe,</v>

4328
01:57:08.430 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4329
01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.550
<v Speaker 5>So then I failed actor,</v>

4330
01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 5>then I came up with another idea.</v>

4331
01:57:13.321 --> 01:57:13.870
<v Speaker 5>I must do it.</v>

4332
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 5>And so how many days had it been?</v>

4333
01:57:15.421 --> 01:57:15.721
<v Speaker 5>You did.</v>

4334
01:57:15.721 --> 01:57:18.840
<v Speaker 5>You did coke Friday and said if you do coke on a Friday and you have a test on a</v>

4335
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:19.201
<v Speaker 5>Monday,</v>

4336
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:20.034
<v Speaker 5>you're going down.</v>

4337
01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 5>But if you wait till Wednesday,</v>

4338
01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:22.854
<v Speaker 5>you're good.</v>

4339
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:24.061
<v Speaker 5>Two hours,</v>

4340
01:57:24.061 --> 01:57:27.390
<v Speaker 5>70 to 72 hours and you can't flush it out at some can't flush that.</v>

4341
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 5>Some magnetic fucking correlation.</v>

4342
01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:31.410
<v Speaker 5>Weed is 30 days.</v>

4343
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.020
<v Speaker 5>But if you keep your normal level,</v>

4344
01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 5>like if you just hit two hits off a joint and go to a gym,</v>

4345
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:37.861
<v Speaker 5>I did a dog,</v>

4346
01:57:37.861 --> 01:57:38.950
<v Speaker 5>they won't catch it real.</v>

4347
01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 5>It can't be nothing in your system.</v>

4348
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 5>You can't show up now.</v>

4349
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 5>And then a month.</v>

4350
01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:42.791
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4351
01:57:42.791 --> 01:57:42.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4352
01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.350
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4353
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.951
<v Speaker 5>I can go.</v>

4354
01:57:43.951 --> 01:57:45.820
<v Speaker 5>If at that time all I needed,</v>

4355
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.920
<v Speaker 5>we was to go to the gym.</v>

4356
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:48.480
<v Speaker 5>How do you think Nick Diaz is doing it?</v>

4357
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:49.590
<v Speaker 5>He dog.</v>

4358
01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:50.620
<v Speaker 5>He wrestles every,</v>

4359
01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:51.780
<v Speaker 5>you do Jiu Jitsu every day.</v>

4360
01:57:51.810 --> 01:57:54.970
<v Speaker 5>Just sweat Sadie and not do 50 bucks enough fat to a story.</v>

4361
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.460
<v Speaker 5>CanNot do 50 bond hits,</v>

4362
01:57:56.461 --> 01:57:58.590
<v Speaker 5>but you could do to bond gets and keep it under the level.</v>

4363
01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.180
<v Speaker 5>Nick did a lot of bagels.</v>

4364
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:01.021
<v Speaker 5>I do whatever,</v>

4365
01:58:01.021 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 5>but holds on about Nick Diaz.</v>

4366
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:03.720
<v Speaker 5>Forget about Nancy poppy seeds.</v>

4367
01:58:03.721 --> 01:58:05.420
<v Speaker 5>So that's for heroin.</v>

4368
01:58:05.421 --> 01:58:06.300
<v Speaker 5>So that's a different thing.</v>

4369
01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.970
<v Speaker 5>But take it to the point where those days,</v>

4370
01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.160
<v Speaker 5>what's the funny thing was I figured I'm smarter than these motherfuckers.</v>

4371
01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Forget about drinking.</v>

4372
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take my own circumcised Dick and I'm gonna pull the skin back and</v>

4373
01:58:17.191 --> 01:58:18.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put byproducts in there.</v>

4374
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:21.443
<v Speaker 5>Sit down,</v>

4375
01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 5>sit out bitch.</v>

4376
01:58:22.801 --> 01:58:23.181
<v Speaker 5>Cause you don't,</v>

4377
01:58:23.181 --> 01:58:28.181
<v Speaker 5>what about Joey Diaz Circa 1987 I would have to go in my mind.</v>

4378
01:58:29.851 --> 01:58:31.500
<v Speaker 5>I thought it out and I said to myself,</v>

4379
01:58:31.501 --> 01:58:33.870
<v Speaker 5>what kills piss on contact.</v>

4380
01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.180
<v Speaker 5>Got Clorox.</v>

4381
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:36.690
<v Speaker 5>But I can't sneak that into money.</v>

4382
01:58:37.590 --> 01:58:38.131
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

4383
01:58:38.131 --> 01:58:40.110
<v Speaker 5>what's the next best thing to kill pissed?</v>

4384
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:41.850
<v Speaker 5>So I figured out pool cleaners,</v>

4385
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:43.293
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4386
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 5>So I went to my buddy's house who had a pool,</v>

02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:57.410
<v Speaker 4>Fucking the other day I scraped my nail against my dick and then fucking start</v>

4529
02:02:57.411 --> 02:02:57.920
<v Speaker 4>bleeding.</v>

4530
02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:58.753
<v Speaker 4>It's discussed.</v>

4531
02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 4>What's the latest with Joe Eddie Bravo fighting?</v>

4532
02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:03.163
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4533
02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:04.820
<v Speaker 4>it's off completely off.</v>

4534
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:06.260
<v Speaker 4>The dude wants money.</v>

4535
02:03:06.261 --> 02:03:07.940
<v Speaker 4>He wants a $50,000.</v>

4536
02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 4>We agreed to the fight,</v>

4537
02:03:09.111 --> 02:03:12.200
<v Speaker 4>but then he said he wants $50,000 and then 25,000 if he wins.</v>

4538
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:14.300
<v Speaker 4>So apparently the shake talked moon,</v>

4539
02:03:14.301 --> 02:03:16.210
<v Speaker 4>whoever was putting together one of the shakes over there,</v>

4540
02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:16.611
<v Speaker 4>not put dollar.</v>

4541
02:03:16.611 --> 02:03:17.444
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

4542
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:18.501
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that,</v>

4543
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:18.830
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4544
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 4>You're asking for too much money.</v>

4545
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:21.320
<v Speaker 4>But who knows?</v>

4546
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 4>They might.</v>

4547
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:23.180
<v Speaker 4>They might come to some sort of an agreement.</v>

4548
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:24.770
<v Speaker 4>I think Horley is 45 years old,</v>

4549
02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:24.950
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4550
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:25.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4551
02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:26.810
<v Speaker 4>it's tough to get that due to fight.</v>

4552
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:27.411
<v Speaker 4>If he's going to fight,</v>

4553
02:03:27.411 --> 02:03:28.200
<v Speaker 4>he wants some cash.</v>

4554
02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Isn't Eddie just then fight that best grade?</v>

4555
02:03:30.110 --> 02:03:32.990
<v Speaker 4>It's not that would fight him because he doesn't really want to fight anybody.</v>

4556
02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 4>He just was going to fight this dude because this dude's always saying that him</v>

4557
02:03:35.901 --> 02:03:37.940
<v Speaker 4>beating him was a fluke and then it was,</v>

4558
02:03:37.941 --> 02:03:38.990
<v Speaker 4>it would never happen again.</v>

4559
02:03:38.991 --> 02:03:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Lightning doesn't strike twice and he's like,</v>

4560
02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:41.121
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4561
02:03:41.121 --> 02:03:41.421
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4562
02:03:41.421 --> 02:03:41.781
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4563
02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:42.614
<v Speaker 4>Well let's do it again.</v>

4564
02:03:42.710 --> 02:03:44.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you the reality is Eddie's better.</v>

4565
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if boilers better than he was back then,</v>

4566
02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:49.910
<v Speaker 4>whether it's an all time great and was beating Eddie before he tapped him.</v>

4567
02:03:50.050 --> 02:03:50.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4568
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:51.143
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know,</v>

4569
02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:51.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4570
02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.120
<v Speaker 4>a boiler consistently improves.</v>

4571
02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he still has the passion for it,</v>

4572
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:57.230
<v Speaker 4>but I know Eddie is a lot better than it was back then.</v>

4573
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean he would win quite grace.</v>

4574
02:03:59.061 --> 02:04:00.380
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad motherfucker dude.</v>

4575
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean he won a ton of tournaments.</v>

4576
02:04:01.911 --> 02:04:03.440
<v Speaker 4>He won Abu Dhabi several times.</v>

4577
02:04:03.650 --> 02:04:06.350
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the most active members of the Gracie family.</v>

4578
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Like he was the guy that was holding it down for the Gracie family in Jujitsu</v>

4579
02:04:09.861 --> 02:04:10.580
<v Speaker 4>tournament.</v>

4580
02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:10.791
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4581
02:04:10.791 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 4>back when Hixon wasn't competing anymore and Hickson was always the greatest.</v>

4582
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Everybody always says that.</v>

4583
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.420
<v Speaker 4>But hoist was doing the UFC for a little bit.</v>

4584
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 4>But as far as like straight Jujitsu,</v>

4585
02:04:18.891 --> 02:04:20.150
<v Speaker 4>fighting the best in the world,</v>

4586
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:22.880
<v Speaker 4>oil or Gracie was holding it down for years,</v>

4587
02:04:22.881 --> 02:04:23.151
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4588
02:04:23.151 --> 02:04:23.990
<v Speaker 4>And he was the man.</v>

4589
02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:25.070
<v Speaker 4>He was beating everybody.</v>

4590
02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

4591
02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 4>it was a big upset when Eddie tapped him and you know,</v>

4592
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:29.601
<v Speaker 4>it was embarrassing,</v>

4593
02:04:29.601 --> 02:04:30.021
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

4594
02:04:30.021 --> 02:04:33.830
<v Speaker 4>And he doesn't like it and I'm sure he doesn't want to have a repeat of that for</v>

4595
02:04:33.831 --> 02:04:34.550
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

4596
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:35.001
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4597
02:04:35.001 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 4>And when he wants to get paid and if he beats him,</v>

4598
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:37.621
<v Speaker 4>he wants to,</v>

4599
02:04:37.621 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4600
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and once I get motivated to work out to beat him and for Eddie,</v>

4601
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:42.241
<v Speaker 1>Eddie says,</v>

4602
02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:42.421
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4603
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:43.231
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight that guy.</v>

4604
02:04:43.231 --> 02:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the only guy I want to fight.</v>

4605
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to prove to everybody that wasn't a fluke.</v>

4606
02:04:46.170 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Yeti's better man.</v>

4607
02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>He's way better than he was back then.</v>

4608
02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:48.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4609
02:04:48.901 --> 02:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's better than a boiler still.</v>

4610
02:04:50.851 --> 02:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

4611
02:04:51.570 --> 02:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll respect the heuler.</v>

4612
02:04:52.471 --> 02:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>He's an all time great,</v>

4613
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but I know that Eddie's a lot better than he was when he beat him last time.</v>

4614
02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>People go in there like just like,</v>

4615
02:04:58.170 --> 02:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't always,</v>

4616
02:04:58.580 --> 02:04:59.413
<v Speaker 1>students love him,</v>

4617
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>but people go there for a couple of days.</v>

4618
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back with that say bro.</v>

4619
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And he's bare to the bone.</v>

4620
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:05.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4621
02:05:05.101 --> 02:05:05.671
<v Speaker 1>you take the,</v>

4622
02:05:05.671 --> 02:05:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you know his guard ain't shit.</v>

4623
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>He's going to wrap you up and fuck you up dude.</v>

4624
02:05:08.731 --> 02:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a lot bigger than he tell you the whole story about what he went</v>

4625
02:05:11.071 --> 02:05:13.560
<v Speaker 1>over there and I would Dobbin weight train with the guy,</v>

4626
02:05:13.561 --> 02:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but the guys trainer was a hen's old guy.</v>

4627
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4628
02:05:17.191 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>the whole story.</v>

4629
02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.301
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

4630
02:05:18.301 --> 02:05:19.134
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it is.</v>

4631
02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I slowed down that.</v>

4632
02:05:20.921 --> 02:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad motherfucker.</v>

4633
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's a Jujitsu genius.</v>

4634
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I've always said this,</v>

4635
02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:24.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4636
02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:28.050
<v Speaker 1>he's just a crazy guy and people look at him and he does all this music and all</v>

4637
02:05:28.051 --> 02:05:29.790
<v Speaker 1>these different things so they get it twisted.</v>

4638
02:05:30.090 --> 02:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to straight Jujitsu,</v>

4639
02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Nicole Nicole's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the way he breaks down techniques,</v>

4644
02:05:38.941 --> 02:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>he's excellent at it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bitch dumb in the ring.</v>

4680
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And they got their shoes off and I was sitting there and I went,</v>

4681
02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4682
02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And he's just taken Alan Belcher and just,</v>

4683
02:06:38.371 --> 02:06:38.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4684
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:39.930
<v Speaker 1>hooks and legs.</v>

4685
02:06:39.931 --> 02:06:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're called,</v>

4686
02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>but I know Alan Belcher was blown away in</v>

4687
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 1>golf.</v>

4688
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4689
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu with something that,</v>

4690
02:06:48.481 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4691
02:06:48.810 --> 02:06:49.081
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

4692
02:06:49.081 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo would be like one of the most respected coaches in the country.</v>

4693
02:06:52.130 --> 02:06:53.340
<v Speaker 1>He was a huge,</v>

4694
02:06:53.490 --> 02:06:53.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4695
02:06:53.761 --> 02:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think he's a just a golfer,</v>

4696
02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't think his coach.</v>

4697
02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:58.441
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

4698
02:06:58.441 --> 02:06:58.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4699
02:06:58.621 --> 02:06:59.670
<v Speaker 1>if it was like something that was,</v>

4700
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 1>golf's a terrible example because it's sort of a game instead of a sport where</v>

4701
02:07:03.001 --> 02:07:03.091
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4702
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is clearly a sport.</v>

4703
02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:05.281
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

4704
02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:05.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4705
02:07:05.521 --> 02:07:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4706
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4707
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 1>he's always wanted to be a musician.</v>

4708
02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

4709
02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>If he just wanted to only be a Jujitsu fighter and,</v>

4710
02:07:13.041 --> 02:07:13.181
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4711
02:07:13.181 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4712
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 1>and keep competing,</v>

4713
02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4714
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:16.620
<v Speaker 1>there's always been dudes that will beat him.</v>

4715
02:07:16.621 --> 02:07:16.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4716
02:07:16.771 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Havi Vasquez beat him a few times and this guy,</v>

4717
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4718
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's not the best in the world because he's not the best athlete,</v>

4719
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but he's a Jujitsu genius man.</v>

4720
02:07:24.450 --> 02:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>He sees shit.</v>

4721
02:07:25.441 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to break shit down and everybody thinks that he like takes credit</v>

4722
02:07:29.251 --> 02:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>for all this other shit,</v>

4723
02:07:30.330 --> 02:07:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but he really doesn't,</v>

4724
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:32.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4725
02:07:32.161 --> 02:07:34.890
<v Speaker 1>when you listen to him talk and teach and actually get to know the guy,</v>

4726
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>he gives credit for every</v>

4727
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 4>single person and learned every move from,</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is the John Joc sweep.</v>

4734
02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't rename shit.</v>

4735
02:07:44.111 --> 02:07:45.100
<v Speaker 4>That's other people's stuff.</v>

4736
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:46.510
<v Speaker 4>If you learned it from somebody else,</v>

4737

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4751

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

02:07:59.621 --> 02:08:00.460
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking,</v>

4755
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:01.601
<v Speaker 4>he's basically,</v>

4756
02:08:01.601 --> 02:08:01.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4757

<v Speaker 4>he's an entertainer,</v>

4758
02:08:02.650 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

4759
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:03.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4760
02:08:03.521 --> 02:08:03.751
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

4761
02:08:03.751 --> 02:08:05.230
<v Speaker 4>he music is his thing,</v>

4762
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.090
<v Speaker 4>but it could have just as well been in.</v>

4763
02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:07.451
<v Speaker 4>He'd been,</v>

4764
02:08:07.451 --> 02:08:08.410
<v Speaker 4>it could have been an actor.</v>

4765
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 4>He easily could have been a comic.</v>

4766
02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:10.361
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4767
02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:10.750
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4768
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I tried to talk him into it,</v>

4769
02:08:11.831 --> 02:08:12.940
<v Speaker 4>he tried it for a while,</v>

4770
02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:14.560
<v Speaker 4>but he was doing too many different things.</v>

4771
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.340
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to teach Jujitsu and try to do music and try and do comedy and it</v>

4772
02:08:18.341 --> 02:08:19.174
<v Speaker 4>was just too hard for him.</v>

4773
02:08:19.230 --> 02:08:19.430
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4774
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.740
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4775
02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:22.690
<v Speaker 4>he came up with some good material and he was trying for a little bit,</v>

4776
02:08:22.691 --> 02:08:24.010
<v Speaker 4>but he's an entertainer,</v>

4777
02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:24.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4778
02:08:24.311 --> 02:08:24.611
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

4779
02:08:24.611 --> 02:08:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu became something for him to focus his energy on and he got,</v>

4780
02:08:28.211 --> 02:08:29.800
<v Speaker 4>he's got a special knack for it.</v>

4781
02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:32.470
<v Speaker 4>And he's just a dude that if he focuses on shit,</v>

4782
02:08:32.590 --> 02:08:33.700
<v Speaker 4>he can get real good at shit.</v>

4783
02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:36.940
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't get taken seriously because he's an entertainer.</v>

4784
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:37.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

02:08:39.911 --> 02:08:42.160
<v Speaker 4>We all get thought of when you're an entertainer,</v>

4788
02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.140
<v Speaker 4>you get thought of as being a silly person.</v>

4789
02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:44.771
<v Speaker 4>You're not a,</v>

4790

4985
02:13:24.951 --> 02:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's public knowledge.</v>
