1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Hello bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that Russian lady</v>

2
00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:07.390
<v Speaker 1>that can pick up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she can carry like 32 kilograms</v>

3
00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>for their pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be more than that.</v>

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like more than 70 pounds I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can show.</v>

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.321
<v Speaker 1>I haven't checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>She has this ability to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they put like a ball and then</v>

7
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>attach a string to a ball at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the string is a weight and she puts that</v>

8
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>ball inside of her pussy and just locks</v>
<v Speaker 1>down on that motherfucker and then can</v>

9
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>literally lift up like 70 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

10
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>It's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

11
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've stood,</v>

12
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I've stood at one end of a strip club</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had a,</v>

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the in Bangkok had a tie stripper fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>dots from the other side of the room out</v>

14
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>of her pussy and pop a balloon that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was holding up in my head.</v>

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>she could fire those things with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>

17
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was so stupid because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have gotten to taking an eye</v>

18
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of speed of his lame at</v>

19
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>speed speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a what?</v>

20
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>She must've been a good 10 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe 30 feet away from me.</v>

21
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's firing him across the room fast</v>

22
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>enough to be able to pop a balloon with</v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>

23
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>with accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

24
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's she doing this?</v>

25
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>And she had like her elbows to the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her knees and she's got her like her</v>

26
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>pussy up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>she was standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to picture exactly what</v>

28
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>position she was in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was sort of kneel,</v>

29
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>kneeling and like standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kneeling.</v>

30
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

32
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>not kneeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bent knees bent.</v>

33
00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Standing Upright and with a thrust of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hips,</v>

34
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>boy shooting it out.</v>

35
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>What bent knees standing up are facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you facing me.</v>

36
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

37
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even seem like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like shooting a gun in the air</v>

38
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're pointing it at the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>

39
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>How did she do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've had a hands on the ground.</v>

40
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.951
<v Speaker 1>To be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

41
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't focused on her fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

42
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I was focused on whether or not she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take my,</v>

43
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I had my eyes closed most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>she had her hands on the ground now it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes perfect sense.</v>

45
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>So she's like a table table sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>upright.</v>

46
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's she getting the air til launch</v>

47
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's confusing about that.</v>

48
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It was so many things that she was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

49
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>They have all kinds of tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had all kinds of stuff.</v>

50
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>They were pink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started that with ping pong balls,</v>

51
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the classic things.</v>

52
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Also razorblades Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not pleasant.</v>

53
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing what people will do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're confronted with a town filled</v>

54
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>with drunk tourists who have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen everything.</v>

55
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>They've seen Moy Thai kickboxing fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>where 16 year old kid's a fucking</v>

56
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>shinned each other in the head until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go unconscious.</v>

57
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>They've seen legalized prostitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

58
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Ladyboys everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is chaos.</v>

59
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.130

<v Speaker 1>piled on him.</v>

60
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And what do they gotta do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They they,</v>

61
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>they have to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's def?</v>

62
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It's evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adapt or die.</v>

63
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to adapt.</v>

64
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

65
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>how to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you got to shoot a dart out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy,</v>

69
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

70
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>you want to make the argument that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

71

<v Speaker 1>that's like one of the best arguments.</v>

72
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I look at that.</v>

73
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not to mention like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I've been to shows there where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

75
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember the finale to one show where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a bear about how 25</v>

76
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I may do my background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my religion.</v>

77
00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit that we have done is,</v>

78
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything that they're saying</v>

79
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that every Muslim is doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

80
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done that in spades and it didn't,</v>

81
00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:30.401
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a couple of extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the leaders of the religion,</v>

82
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crusades,</v>

83
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking pedophilia.</v>

84
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in bed with the Nazis.</v>

85
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>when Jews went to find like where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell it all,</v>

87
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I would have took my riding lawnmower or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

88
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 1>They went up at the fucking Vatican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of this shit was there now.</v>

89
00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:46.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>is that what those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>they were on both sides.</v>

93
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

94
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how this is going to shake</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

95
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of people in Europe who</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

96
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>they've always done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>

97
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a Dang cars the Germans make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

99
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I thought enough of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too small and island are too</v>

100
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>small a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big country like the United</v>

101
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>States and they made shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be pretty,</v>

102
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite quotes from a German</v>
<v Speaker 1>general was said,</v>

103
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>one tiger tank was worth four American</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sherman tanks,</v>

104
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>but the Americans always had five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great quote.</v>

105
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking Mcdonald's.</v>

106
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>We were just cranking them out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking quarter pounders with chase and</v>

107
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>his crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the fact like Audi,</v>

108
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BMW,</v>

109
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 1>like BMW used to make jet engines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that technology was in their tax dude.</v>

110
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this shit I've been reading is</v>

111
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like when American soldiers killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody German,</v>

112
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>they dropped the American gun and picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the German feeling.</v>

113
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like are are machine guns I guess</v>

114
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>overheated or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

115
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

116
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>You like car nearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is.</v>

117
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've got,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>I was 17 years old at the time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was traveling abroad,</v>

166
00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I was actually exchange student in Japan</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was really lonely.</v>

167
00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I stayed with a host family and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know any Japanese and I know you</v>

168
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:01.890
<v Speaker 2>and I spoke English and so I was online</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all the time,</v>

169
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:03.810
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

170
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is kind of before my space</v>

171
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 2>or facebook or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd go to different like social</v>

172
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:12.130
<v Speaker 2>networking sites and talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

173
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>one day this guy starts talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a total pervert.</v>

174
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like into a getting peed on and he</v>

175
00:07:19.051 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 2>really has a thing for like panty hose</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

176
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>and so he strikes up a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me cause he just thinks I'm very</v>

177
00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 2>attractive and all this and I was kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like grossed out by them,</v>

178
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 2>but it intrigued at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

179
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

180
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to a guy online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do anything to me.</v>

181
00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:40.971
<v Speaker 2>So I kept the lines of communication</v>
<v Speaker 2>open and we'd talk here and there and,</v>

182
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>and he always tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.350
<v Speaker 2>convince me to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really wanted me to piano and stuff</v>

184
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:48.030
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

185
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to do that.</v>

186
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept turning him down and then,</v>

187
00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day he was like,</v>

189
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.510

<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

190
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I think your pitch should be bottled and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sold.</v>

191
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.950
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

192
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 2>all right by it then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't think he was serious.</v>

00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's full of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine by it.</v>

195
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.150

<v Speaker 2>and he did,</v>

196
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.940
