We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that is o n n I t at on it.

33
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.150
We have a a new version,

35
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:13.551
about t plus that increased his strength up to 36% faster than placebo.

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
One of the things we tried to do it on a.com or one of the things we do do is

37
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.430
anything that we have that's controversial.

I use these all the time and Keith will be on next month.

64
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.010
Very excited to have him back on or have him on brother.
And um,

65
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.330
all the other exercise videos that we have are,
are excellent as well.

66
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.010
There's a gang of them online too.

67
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.190
If you don't feel like buying a DVD and you're thinking about starting a workout

68
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.740
program,
just plenty of stuff on youtube for free.
Um,

69
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.840
the one thing that I recommend,
I always do,
and I can't say it enough,

70
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.950
start slow.
If you're the type of person that just isn't,

71
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
you haven't exercised before or you're kind of lazy and you're like,
this is it.

72
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.200
I'm getting my shit together.
Please don't rush.

73
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:33.640
It starts slow.
Let your body build up,
write down your progress,

74
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.430
and if you can,
if you can afford it,
go to a trainer.

75
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.300
Go to a trainer at least at first and have someone film it just to make sure

76
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:41.470
you're doing the proper form.

77
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.620
The last thing you want to do is hurt yourself when you're trying to get your

78
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:49.030
shit together.
All right,
fuckers.
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.
N N.

79
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.770
Use the codeword Rogan again and save 10% off any and all supplements.
All right,

80
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.260
Mike Baker is here.
We're going to find out some shit.

81
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.630
We're going to get down to business.
Cue The music.
Jamie,

82
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.730
the Joe Rogan experience.

83
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.590
<v 1>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast,
my night all day.</v>

84
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.550
<v 0>Oh righty.
Mike Baker,
first of all,
start.
Thank you very much for joining us.</v>

85
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.980
We appreciate you.
Thank you.

86
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.640
<v 2>Love the podcast and by the way,</v>

87
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.170
the Codeword Rogan may not be that secure as a code word,

88
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.070
<v 0>but it's a good one.
It's a terrible code.
Works as far as security.
Know.</v>

89
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.010
If it was your Wifi Password,
I would say,
uh,
you're in deep.

90
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.590
You've got to change that.
Then,
well,
coming from you,
you,

91
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:37.900
you know about some shit.
Uh,
you're,
you're a former,
we'll explain what you did.

92
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.080
You were the form of covert operations officer for the CIA.

93
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.190
<v 2>I,
I,
I,
uh,
went in and I was recruited in the agency,
uh,
and the,
and the,</v>

94
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.060
and the CIS,
uh,
divided into,
uh,
a handful of directorates.

95
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.480
You've got the director of operations,
which is pretty much what it sounds like.

96
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.460
Uh,
you've got the director of intelligence,

97
00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:59.030
which is where they put all the smart people and they do all the reports
writing.

98
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.690
They take all the raw intelligence is coming in from the field and they put into

99
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:07.550
some usable form that can then be kicked out the door to the National Security

100
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.630
Council.
The White House.
It's,

101
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:13.370
it's used by the other agencies in the Intel community and primarily by the

102
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.290
White House.
So a lot of smart people sitting over there.

103
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.390
Then they've got s and t,
which is science and technology.

104
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.210
That's where you get all the gear.
So that's where they develop all,

105
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.430
I mean they've developed in the agency over the years.

106
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:27.431
Everything from the youtube to a stealth technology drone capability.

107
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.380
All a lot of the drone technology came right out of the agency.

108
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:33.920
They've done a tremendous number of things,
uh,
right there in house.

109
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.420
And then we have the administrative logistics group and they're incredibly

110
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:40.120
important because they keep uh,

111
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.100
money and gear and everything else flowing out to the field.

112
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.730
<v 0>What is the biggest misconception about the CIA knew being,
you know,</v>

113
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.900
a guy who worked with them for years.

114
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.100
Like I know that there's all sorts of wacky conspiracies out there about

115
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.110
everything.
Anything that there is,

116
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.690
where people don't have all the facts and information,

117
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.520
there's going to be wacky conspiracies.
Look,

118
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.450
I know a bunch of wacky conspiracies just about the UFC.

119
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.730
There were the ridiculous and me knowing the actual inside truth.

120
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.460
I hear these things and I go,
what the fuck are you talking about?

121
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.510
Things that I'm supposed to say,
the things that I had to do,
because you know,

122
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.830
the UFC made me or they said you have to say this,
which is all 100% bullshit,

123
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.320
right?
What's,
what are the big misconceptions?

124
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.450
<v 2>No,
you're absolutely right.
And,
and the agency is,
is a,
it's like,</v>

125
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.880
it attracts this sort of thing,
right?

126
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.820
It attracts sort of the Byzantine theories and the conspiracy theories and all

127
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:32.550
that.
Because again,
there's a reason why you have secrets.

128
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.410
There's a reason why you protect sources and methods.

129
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:37.860
And so because you don't have transparency that people would like to see,

130
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.280
they assume that you're out to fuck him over.
You're out the screw of the world.

131
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.720
And,
and that's just not the case.

132
00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:47.310
So I guess the number one conspiracy as it's somehow the CIA and the Intel

133
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:51.150
community of the u s is a involved in some one world government that they're

134
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.170
basically out the fuck everybody and they're not,
the agency has an incredibly,

135
00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:58.350
a political organization.
It doesn't matter who's in charge of the White House.

136
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.150
You get your task and you march on.

137
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.810
And that's a really good thing because a lot of other countries over there,

138
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:07.230
including a lot of our allies,
they have very politicized intel community.

139
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.490
So every time you get a change in leadership,
you know,
I'll go some people,

140
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.010
it comes from New People and they're beholden to the,
uh,
to the White House.

141
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.100
So that's one of the things,
you know,
I suppose the other thing would be,
um,

142
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.330
that we've got nothing but hot chicks walking around the building.

143
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.220
And if you walk in,
we got wonderful people,
but we,
you know,

144
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.800
we don't have that many hot chicks.
Isn't that because a homeland?
Yeah,
exactly.

145
00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.560
One show fucked it up for everybody.
Yeah.
Alias and all the,
all the other movies,

146
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.820
a beach books,
you know,
everybody's supposed to be hot in the AC.

147
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.360
I was disappointed too.
I mean,
when I started there,

148
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:42.050
I got in for my first couple of days of training.
I kept thinking,

149
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.390
why are they hiding them or they someplace else,

150
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.690
or a lot of really great people.
But you know,
the quote of hot chicks was,

151
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:50.670
was less than I expected.

152
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.500
<v 0>You bring up an interesting point about being a political.</v>

153
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.870
Now that's one thing that a lot of people worry about when it comes to

154
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.300
organizations that they may have more power.

155
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.560
In fact then the political governing body that controls the country.

156
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.750
One of the big theories about the CIA with the CIA had Kennedy killed because

157
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.550
Kennedy was trying to get rid of the CIA.
I mean,
it wasn't that one of the big,

158
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.980
<v 2>that was what,
that was one of the big ones and that's still endearing.
Um,
I did,</v>

159
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.060
uh,
I cohost a show on travel channel,

160
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.370
American declassified,
right?
That was the first season.

161
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:24.110
It's going to their changing the title for the second season.

162
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:26.220
But in the first season we,
uh,
we,

163
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.620
we looked at the Kennedy assassination and absolutely I talked to a number of

164
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:35.390
people who have been involved in,
in,
in,
uh,
studying that for a long time.

165
00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:35.810
And there you,

166
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.810
you'll never going to shift him off that position that the agency was involved.

167
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:43.130
And there's a lot of people out there.
And part of it is because
again,

168
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:46.520
there's no transparency and people assume the worst if they don't get exactly

169
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:49.250
what they want to hear.
And people like conspiracy theories anyway,

170
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.890
they always want it.
Yeah,
that's fine.
Yeah,
fine.
Yeah.
What's not to like

171
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.330
<v 0>you,
uh,
you interviewed that Jim Marrs guy on your show,
American declassified,</v>

172
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.530
and he's,
uh,
he's,
he's an interesting cat.
He's a full on nutter,
right?

173
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.440
I'll stick with,
he's an interesting cat.

174
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.300
He's a full on nutter slash interesting cow and he's a,

175
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.050
he's all about Ua foes and bases on the moon.

176
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.230
<v 2>That's not bases on the moon.
I mean,
there may be that part that,
yeah,</v>

177
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:20.280
I can confirm that.
But uh,
as far as the Kennedy assassination goes,
again,
it's,

178
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:23.250
it's,
it's one of those things you could see why at the end of not,

179
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.630
I don't want it disappeared on that rabbit hole.

180
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:26.310
But you can see why at the end of that story,

181
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:29.430
that episode when we talked to a lot of people,
we did a lot of research.

182
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.060
You can see why they,
the theory still holds a conspiracy is still out there.

183
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.830
<v 0>What do you think happened with Kennedy?
Do you think Oswald acted alone?</v>

184
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 2>Yeah.
You know what,
I think that,
um,
once you get inside there,</v>

185
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.660
we got really good access into that and that's part of what the show's about.

186
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:44.870
But we had really good access into that window,
that very spot where,
you know,

187
00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:48.980
he took the shots.
Now he wasn't,
he wasn't Lex Luther,

188
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.940
but he had enough training.
And when you look at the distance involved,

189
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.600
the line of sight,
the weather conditions,

190
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:56.510
the lighting addition to the fact that he reconned that target or that site

191
00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:00.260
beforehand,
because he worked there,
he had every advantage he needed.

192
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.170
And so the idea that he could make those shots with the,

193
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:06.150
with the training that he had received from the marines,
again,
he would,
you know,

194
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.170
was he the world's greatest?
Never.
Of course not.
But he had enough.

195
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.710
And also he had an element of luck going forward,

196
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.620
which you always need an operations.
So I think,
I think he took the shots.
Now.

197
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.270
I also think that he was in his mind,

198
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.360
he felt he was doing this because he was desperate to join.
At that point.

199
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:25.130
He was desperate to join the Cuban revolution.

200
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.370
He had been very disappointed by is time spent over in Russia.

201
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.920
And he had come back and he was looking for something and he felt,

202
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.181
this is my theory.

203
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:39.020
He felt that this was going to get him in with Castro by doing this.

204
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:39.771
And I honestly believe that.

205
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:44.500
Now here's the other part that's a bit of a wildcard.
Uh,
the,
uh,
the,

206
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:48.650
the,
the Cuban Intel service had a file,
a massive file on him,

207
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.720
courtesy of the Russians.
Of course,
the record.
I mean,

208
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:53.620
the Russians trained most of the Cuban Intel service at that time and they had

209
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:58.000
provided a great deal of information because Oswald had been living in Russia

210
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.800
for the time.
You married a Russian woman.
He,
you know,

211
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.610
worked in a radio factory and,
and,
and again had a very disappointing experience.

212
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:06.220
And the Russians were pretty much happy to get rid of him at that point because

213
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:08.230
he was,
you know,
it was serving no purpose.

214
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.680
And so by the time he had gotten back to the states,

215
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.430
the Cubans already had a big file on him.
Now he had also gone to Mexico.

216
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:18.010
There was an unexplained trip that he had taken down in Mexico City,

217
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.370
so do do I think that there's a potential that probably not a directed by the

218
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:27.490
Cuban government,
but probably in his mind thinking,
this is how I do it.

219
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.270
This is how I get in.
This is,
he was,
I mean he was a sociopath,
but

220
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.710
<v 0>I think he's,
one of the things that bugs me about people,</v>

221
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:38.250
the way they look at the Kennedy assassination is that it's either Lee Harvey

222
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.960
Oswald acted alone or it was a conspiracy and Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't a part of

223
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.670
it,
and my thoughts were always like,

224
00:12:44.671 --> 00:12:47.070
why would you assume that he wasn't a part of it?

225
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.880
Just because people said there were shots from other directions.
First of all,

226
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:54.300
we all know that eye witness accounts are some of the most unreliable accounts

227
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:58.020
ever.
Absolutely.
People see things that aren't there that hear things.

228
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:01.710
They remember things completely wrong that if,

229
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.560
especially in the traumatic event,
your adrenaline fires up,

230
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:07.950
your heart rate goes up.
There's shots going off,
you hear things,

231
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.660
but it was behind me.
Michael Brown.
Yeah,
exactly.
Well,
that's another,

232
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:14.730
we'd go down that rabbit hole too.
But the,

233
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.050
the thing that drives me crazy about the Kennedy assassination too is when they

234
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:21.360
show Lee Harvey out,
when they try to disprove it,

235
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:24.150
like Jesse Ventura did a show where he tried to disprove it.

236
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.830
He was holding a rifle in his arm.
He was,
he was cocking it and firing it,

237
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.160
but he was standing holding it and I'm like,
you got a window sill.

238
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.400
If you're trying to hit something accurately,
why would you hold it in your arm?

239
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.600
Why wouldn't you rest it on that window sill when you're resting it on something

240
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:43.260
you,
it's incredibly stable.
You don't have to be a master marksman.

241
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.430
And when you have a rifle resting down on something,
all it is,

242
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:48.330
is about not flinching.

243
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.050
<v 2>It's a platform and it's going to give you some stability.
And,</v>

244
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.910
and we looked at that with,
with the Mlk,

245
00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:56.000
with Martin Luther King assassination to um,
and you know,

246
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:59.420
the fact that the show was taken out of a bathroom window and it was clear given

247
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.680
the that that yes,

248
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.540
common sense tells you and the in the physical nature of that tells you that he

249
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:07.210
rested the,
the weapon on the window sills.

250
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:10.940
So you look at Oswald and again Oswald recky this site,

251
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.290
he knew what he was getting into.

252
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.610
He knew how he was going to take this shot and had had sufficient training from

253
00:14:16.611 --> 00:14:20.240
the marines.
So I agree with him.
And that's typically with conspiracy theories.

254
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:20.960
It's typically always,

255
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.160
it's all one or it's all the other and the real world operates in a much

256
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.960
different murky or environment in that

257
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.490
<v 0>no doubt,
no doubt.
But what bothers me about it,</v>

258
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.460
there's a bunch of things that bothered me about it.
The,

259
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:35.710
the single bullet theory without a doubt bothers me because that doesn't make

260
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:39.340
any sense at all.
When you see that bullet showing up on Connolly's Gurney,

261
00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:40.600
it's in pristine condition.

262
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:43.690
It's supposed to gone through two bodies is more cause bullet particles.

263
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:46.180
Fragments that are in Connally's bothered.
They showed up on an x ray.

264
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:49.570
They're not missing from that bullet.
That seems a little wonky.

265
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.450
And the whole reason Arlen Specter concocted that in the first place was because

266
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.600
they had to account for a bullet that hit a curb stone under the overpass.

267
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.160
Guy got hit with a ricochet.

268
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.580
Now they've attributed three bullets to this one guy shooting.

269
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.700
They have to attribute all these wounds to one bullet for this theory to make

270
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:08.690
any sense.
That to me is the biggest hole in the

271
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.170
<v 2>the conspiracy.
Right.
And that's,</v>

272
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.880
and I mean at the end of our episode and for what it's worth,

273
00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:14.340
I mean we basically include looked like it.

274
00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:19.341
It's clear there are issues here that remain and are they likely to be solved?

275
00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:23.620
Probably not.
Given the fact that a lot of people have passed away some in,

276
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.770
you know,
odd circumstances.
We looked at that issue to the people that,
you know,

277
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.390
the died.
Oh Shit.
The,
yeah.
Yeah.
And so,
but again,
uh,

278
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.070
you know,
our point was not this,

279
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:37.370
I think anytime you set out to disprove a conspiracy theory or prove it,
you're,

280
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.860
you're going to be left unsatisfied.

281
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.130
<v 0>But the disproved part was wonky though.
The holding the gun was Wonky,</v>

282
00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:46.190
like the why would he hold it?
And the other thing was warranted.

283
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.130
They said the site was off.
We check the rifle,
the site was off.
Well,

284
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.120
this is in person.

285
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.380
I can tell you I wounded a deer once that I was trying to kill because I dropped

286
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:59.370
a rifle,
I fell,
I dropped the rifle and the site went off like that.

287
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.800
You could take us,
you've got a rifle,

288
00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:06.630
you're moving it around from the crime scene,
you're putting it somewhere else,

289
00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:08.250
you putting in cars and then you test it.

290
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.910
You can't tell me that rifle sight was off when he shot it because you don't

291
00:16:11.911 --> 00:16:12.300
know.

292
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.430
<v 2>Right.
You don't,
you don't know.
And you're absolutely right.
It,
you know,</v>

293
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:17.520
how sensitive those things can and particularly older technology.
All right.
So,

294
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.510
uh,
I mean some of the,
some of the gear now is pretty robust and,

295
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:24.060
and designed to stand up to pretty difficult conditions,
but you know,

296
00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:27.180
that gear that you know,
it,
it's old,
it's old and it,
and you're absolutely right.

297
00:16:27.181 --> 00:16:30.010
It went from place to place to place a secret service for storing at the bureau

298
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:31.680
was storing and everybody was,
you know,
had their hands on it.

299
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.540
<v 0>Yeah.
But if he had it cited in,</v>

300
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.050
if it was accurate at the time and he's resting it on the window,
man,

301
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:39.360
that's a different animal.
Yeah.

302
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.920
My number one problem with is that single bullet theory,

303
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:45.160
this is the number one problem.
The other thing is this is approved or film.

304
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.150
There's a prude or film was weird because everybody points to the Zapruder film,

305
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:52.750
the whole back into the left,
back into the left.
You know,
you see Kennedy,

306
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.340
it looks like he's getting shot from the front.

307
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:58.870
But what they don't say is that the blood is kind of spring forward.

308
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.480
If you watch that video,
he's going back to the left,
but the,
the blood is,

309
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.910
is sprang forward almost as if he was hit twice.

310
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.150
Like he was hit with one bullet from the front and one bullet from the back.

311
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.050
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's,
again,
it's one of those,
it's the movement of the vehicle.</v>

312
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:17.830
It's,
it's,
it,
it,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's his immobility it to begin with.
I mean,

313
00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:20.320
if he didn't have back problems,
you know,
he could have,
he probably,

314
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:23.350
he probably could have maneuvered himself out,
you know,
quick enough.

315
00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:27.040
But Kennedy was fairly immobile.
That's a lot of things.

316
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.070
One of the things that people don't realize,
he was really sick before he died.

317
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah,
and it was,
again,
so I think the conspiracy things,

318
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.860
going back to your original point,

319
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:39.760
the agency is always just sort of ground zero for people's conspiracies.
Yeah.

320
00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:39.810
Yeah.

321
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.030
<v 0>Well,
there's so many people involved in it too.</v>

322
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.800
One of the things that I found completely fascinating about this whole thing

323
00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:51.640
with Patraeus is Patraeus got in trouble with the,

324
00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:55.410
the FBI was investigating the CIA and there they,
you know,

325
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:57.930
the whole thing with the,
uh,
the emails,
like,

326
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.460
that seems to me to be so crazy that agencies investigate other agencies.

327
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.940
Is it really competition between like the CIA and the FBI?

328
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.590
<v 2>Well,
you know what,
it's better than it used to be.
I mean,
I remember when,
uh,</v>

329
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.670
when the,
when the,
when the,
when the bureau started going overseas,
uh,

330
00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:18.040
when they started getting involved in,
in,
uh,
uh,
terrorism issues overseas,
um,

331
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.690
they would send their people out.
And I remember I was,

332
00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:23.510
I was operating overseas and I remember we had a,

333
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.000
we had a meeting one time and I went into a,
to a,
to an embassy,
um,

334
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.950
because I said,
look,
you know,
we're gonna have a meeting.
Okay.

335
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.420
We were doing something out on the street.

336
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.730
So I'm up going in there and looking at our guys,
you know,

337
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.350
taking down,
you know,
maps and photos and charts and everything,
uh,
you know,

338
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:44.630
have this thing that was gonna happen and stuffing them in a desk.
And I said,

339
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.550
what's going on?
And they said,
well the bureau is coming in
so you know,

340
00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:52.010
we've got to take all this yet.
We don't want them to see this stuff.

341
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:53.510
But the idea was we were,
you know,

342
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.450
working together and if you're out on the street,

343
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.980
I mean our natural response was,

344
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:00.980
well I thought were working together cause I don't,

345
00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:02.890
I don't want to get my ass caught out there.
If,
you know,

346
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:05.450
if we could tell them something that would make sense.
But you know,

347
00:19:05.451 --> 00:19:08.420
also at the same down,
the bureau was telling us about 50% of what they knew.

348
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.030
And so there was,
there was a lot of uh,
uh,
difficulties.

349
00:19:13.031 --> 00:19:15.470
Some of it highlighted after nine 11 that was talked about a lot.

350
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:16.310
So I don't want to go into that.

351
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.860
Everybody talked about other than didn't need to play well with others.

352
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.730
And so it's got,
it has gotten a lot better.
We've got a much better relationship.

353
00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:23.910
And I personally,

354
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.120
because I work with them and I've worked with them a lot in the past,
I,

355
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:28.490
I have a little great deal of appreciation for the bureau.

356
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.430
And so that side of things has gotten a lot better.

357
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:34.700
It's never going to get perfect.
Well no,
because you know,
it's human nature.

358
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:35.541
It's human nature.
Yeah.

359
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.540
You're pissing on each other's turf sometimes and you know that.

360
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:41.870
And now the agencies in a,
in a bit of a different situation,

361
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:46.280
I mean the bureau has bigger issues with ATF and some others because they're all

362
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:51.050
kind of focused on law enforcement in some capacity.
And,
and uh,
my old outfit,

363
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.650
you know,
we've got a different focus so it doesn't usually surface.

364
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.510
And when it does,
it's typically in a,
in a terrorist concern.
Um,
so,

365
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.500
but I,
it is better.
It is better.
Look at,
look at me,
Mr Rosie.
I've got,

366
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.470
I've got my glass half full and by the way,
the coffees and I shoot,

367
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.880
you're not this,
we talked about it before,
but this is great.
Coffee.

368
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.160
<v 0>Yeah,
it's delicious.
That's caveman coffee,
really.
Columbia.
Um,</v>

369
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.110
the,
the,
the,
the thing about it is,
is it because everybody wants to take credit?

370
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.921
Is it like,
you know,

371
00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:24.340
the FBI wants to take credit for catching bad guys and the CIA is going after

372
00:20:24.341 --> 00:20:27.100
the same people and they're competing to reach the finish line first.

373
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.173
Is that what it is

374
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.710
<v 2>in part,
yeah.
I mean,
I,</v>

375
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.080
I'd probably be lying if I said there's not an element that's gotta be an

376
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:33.960
element of that,
right?
Everybody's competitive and you,

377
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.010
and these are two very tight they organizations,

378
00:20:36.011 --> 00:20:40.060
but part of it is also just the feeling like you've got,

379
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.310
you know what you're doing,
you've got the process and you,
you,
you,

380
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.330
and your process is better.
And there's also an aspect of it.

381
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.800
Law enforcement looks at,
at,
uh,
as an example,

382
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:52.840
law enforcement looked at sources differently,
right?

383
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.340
The agency is all about developing sources and,

384
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.790
and maintaining those and building on them.
Because what are you trying to do?

385
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.470
You're trying to gather intelligence,
right?
So we're not trying to,

386
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.390
at the end of the day,
uh,
you know,
the bus,
somebody,
I mean,

387
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.050
maybe at the end of an operation we're looking to terminate them.

388
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:12.340
But I mean that's,
that's a different story.
I just forget I said that.

389
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.330
But,
uh,
at the,
at the end of the day that law enforcement and you know,

390
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.520
oftentimes it's like,
let's,
we've got a source of great,

391
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:21.610
we don't mind burning that source because we're after the bus to where after,

392
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:24.550
you know,
some,
some gear or whatever it is.
Um,
and so there's a,

393
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:27.550
there's a fundamental difference there sometimes and the way that we view our

394
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:32.150
assets.
Um,
but oftentimes,
yeah,
I,
you can't disregard the fact that it's,

395
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.490
it's professional pride.

396
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.341
<v 0>It's always there.</v>

397
00:21:34.341 --> 00:21:39.070
It's always a conflict in every movie where there's like cops and,
and you know,

398
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.300
and the FBI comes in,
we're taking over this investigation.
Shit,
this is all case.

399
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:48.120
You know,
that's,
that's so common in the captain's office.
Chew your ass out.
Yeah.

400
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.890
Yeah.
They have control of this crime scene.
Like you motherfucker.

401
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.340
And then they leave.
That's,
that's so we just wrote a show,

402
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:58.270
didn't I think we did and it's already been done a million times.
Unfortunate.

403
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.120
<v 2>Yeah.
The CIA guys always end up looking like Douche bags in the,
um,</v>

404
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.980
in the frankly in the movies or in the shelves.
I mean that's,

405
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.720
but where we were used to that frankly,

406
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:09.410
we just like getting washed up on Capitol Hill and having our ass kicked every

407
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:09.970
now and then.

408
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.080
<v 0>Well,
not on homeland,
on homeland.
You guys look pretty good.
That's true.</v>

409
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.270
The agency people watch homeland and go away.

410
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.120
<v 2>Uh,
you know what,
this is gonna sound weird,
but I don't watch any of that.</v>

411
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.120
I don't,
I don't,
I,

412
00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:26.740
I'm a terrible person to sit down and my wife refuses to sit with me and,

413
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.430
and even tried to start watching something like that because I,
you know,

414
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.380
I know that she's irritated when every time I start Kinda squirming and go,
no,

415
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.830
the fuck,
you know what?
I'm making noises,
you know,

416
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:38.890
and I'm kind of like a shifting around and she's finally just as hell.
Fuck it.

417
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:39.850
Just go somewhere else.

418
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.040
<v 0>Hi.
Can,
I can understand like did that,</v>

419
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:45.500
when I watched punchline with Tom Hanks and Sally fields,

420
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.680
I'll say exactly what did they have lockers.

421
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.100
Nobody has a locker room and you guys don't get lockers.
Have Walkers.

422
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.740
What do you put your,
we don't have anything.
Sports gear.

423
00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.140
Your jockstrap fucking lacrosse stick.
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.

424
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.020
But is there anybody who's gotten it right?

425
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.810
Is there like any movie or anything that you've ever seen?
We like,

426
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.920
that's pretty damn close.

427
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.440
<v 2>You know,</v>

428
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.880
there's some old school ones when you talk about straight up trade craft,

429
00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:14.580
when you're talking about old school espionage,
then things like,
uh,

430
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:19.230
Smiley's people,
some of the old sort of BBC shows.
Oh,
I don't know if that is,

431
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.190
what does Smiley's people,
it's an old,
uh,
what does it look,
Carrie?
I think that,

432
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:27.330
uh,
that wrote it.
I'm not sure,
but it's a,
it's,
it has,

433
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.590
it hasn't been airing for a long,
long time.
Uh,
but that was good.

434
00:23:31.591 --> 00:23:33.870
The Good Shepherd is a movie,
the Good Shepherd.

435
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.650
I thought it was very interesting.
It.
It kind of dragged on for a while and,

436
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.100
and honestly,
who could believe that?
You know,

437
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.560
if you're married to Angelina Jolie,

438
00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:43.110
you're going to want to like go away all the time.

439
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.970
<v 0>That would be annoying.
After awhile.
I don't</v>

440
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.400
<v 3>know,
a week with her on an island somewhere,
you'd be like,
all right bitch,</v>

441
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.530
I'm shipping it longer than a week.
Yeah,

442
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.470
I would have to give it longer than the way you're a patient,
man.
I am a patient,

443
00:23:55.750 --> 00:24:00.200
but I think that uh,
those,
those,
those were great.
They did a show.

444
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.840
Full disclosure,
I,

445
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.910
I worked on the show from its inception called spooks in the UK and it was a,

446
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:13.580
it was called a am my five over here in the states and it aired for a number or

447
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:17.110
several seasons.
It was actually,
I think probably the most successful show in,

448
00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:21.140
in UK television history.
And then it ran for about eight years as a drama.

449
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:24.470
More successful than top gear.
Well,
yeah,
no,
not,
no,
not,
not that,

450
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:25.430
but I mean like a drama.

451
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.000
Typically what they do is if they get success with a drama or a comedy,

452
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:31.670
they just stop it because they feel guilty because,
I don't know,

453
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:35.050
it's a British thing,
but they,
this thing ran for eight seasons.
Um,

454
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.400
they did a very good job of,
of,
you know,

455
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.820
not focusing on the explosions and the car chases and everything.
And it was,

456
00:24:40.821 --> 00:24:44.380
it was more about trade craft and things that were going on,
um,

457
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.880
to accomplish an operation.
But,
uh,
I liked the Bourne series.
I think,
you know,

458
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:53.390
I know that that's not realistic,
but I like that.
I know it's so unrealistic,

459
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.970
but I like the pacing of it.
I liked it.
You know,
I'll usually the,
yeah,

460
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.970
the filming is great that the moon,
so as a way to just,

461
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.310
because it's so obviously not realistic.
It's great.

462
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.720
[inaudible] you can get to immerse in it.

463
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.850
The ones I have trouble with it where they try to,
you know,

464
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:06.680
they throw a little something or they're trying to make it look like they know

465
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:09.320
what they're doing and then you think of it fuck sake.
But yeah,

466
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.490
the Bourne series is more like a superhero show.
Exactly.
So you can,

467
00:25:12.491 --> 00:25:14.360
you can kind of get lost in it a little bit easier.

468
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.410
My problem with the Bourne series is this is my major problem with it and

469
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:19.730
especially the last one.

470
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
It seems like they're pussified [inaudible] superheroes and tough guys.

471
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.450
And to the point where they never tried to get laid ever.

472
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.880
They have zero sexual attraction to the most beautiful women on the planet.

473
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
They have totally pure altruistic purposes to all of their actions.

474
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.950
Everything they do is noble.
Like this guy.
Who the Fuck Jeremy Renner?

475
00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:48.110
Is that what I did?
I didn't see the last one,
the last one.

476
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:52.010
It's fucking ridiculous cause he's with this chick is hot as the fucking sun and

477
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:55.310
she's fawning over him and at the end of the scene,
the end of the movie,

478
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.140
they're sitting apart from each other.

479
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.860
Like he saved her life about 150 fucking times she should be.
So he's,

480
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.750
he's handsome.
He's a stud.
He's kicked 150,000 people's asses in front of her.

481
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.340
Like,
she should be blown away by this guy and they should be,
or vice versa.
Yeah.

482
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:14.570
Both.
And they're leaving there on this boat and they're sitting apart from each

483
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:17.570
other.
Like as far apart as you and I are like,
they're not even hugging.

484
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.860
Like there's nothing like James Bond would have fucked her a million probably in

485
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.340
the first five minutes.
I mean,
that's the whole point of a bond movie.
But yeah.

486
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.540
No,

487
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.540
I know isn't that they were with a supposed to be a man of ranger out there

488
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.820
kicking ass and action.
Yeah,
no,
I believe me,

489
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:37.640
I go back to my point about the hot chicks.
When I first started the agency,

490
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:42.020
I thought that was,
that was kind of part of the deal.
But um,

491
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.960
this,
the,
the,
the first three,
was it three,
the first three Bourne movies?

492
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.430
You're right.
It was the same way with,
uh,
with,
uh,
what's his name?
Um,

493
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.470
who played the role?
Oh yeah.
Matt Damon.
Uh,
it was,
it was always anxious ridden,

494
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.011
you know,

495
00:26:56.011 --> 00:27:00.870
and if you got an indication that he might have just been banging one of the

496
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:02.370
girls that was in the movie,
it was,

497
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.990
he seemed like he was sorry about it and he was depressed about it because,

498
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.630
I don't know,
I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.

499
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.890
Trying to mute male sexuality when you're dealing with trained killers,

500
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.780
it doesn't make any sense.
I mean,

501
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.440
it's like the polar opposite of what we can say.

502
00:27:18.441 --> 00:27:23.441
Like if you think about the ancient warriors to think about like gladiator or

503
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.970
any of these ancient warriors,
you connect these ancient warriors with,

504
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.210
they would fight and they would fuck.
But these Bourne identity guys,

505
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:33.000
there's no fucking,
no,
not saying it wasn't interesting thing.

506
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:34.800
And I think who knows what they were,
what they were thinking.

507
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:38.040
I do think they were trying to make it seem as if they were just so angst ridden

508
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.500
that they were kind of above it all.
You know what I think they're doing?

509
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:43.160
I think they're doing the same shit they're doing with twilight there.

510
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.730
They're making things for chicks.

511
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.640
They're turning vampires and these fucking glittery,

512
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.440
glittery queers that like hang out in the forest and they don't hurt anybody.

513
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.760
It's madness.

514
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:57.700
They're doing this thing where they're turning into these romantic novels of

515
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.810
completely unrealistic behavior.
What they're doing.

516
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:05.660
Anybody out there wants success.
Just write like a tween book flew to Vampire,
uh,

517
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.360
and no sacks.
And I guess you're good to go.
But the thing is,
is not tweens.

518
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.330
It's grown.
Women want their shit too.

519
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.140
It's this weird fantasy thing that it plays off of.
It's,

520
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:17.430
I don't understand it.

521
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.140
The female psyche is a mystery to me and dude,
I had to everyone,

522
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.790
but I'm with you on that one.

523
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:26.670
Although I am married to the world's greatest woman,
so no,
you're not.

524
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.330
So good luck.
But we always have the same girl.
We're not good.
God.

525
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.270
How we found that out?
That would be crazy.
Oh my God.
You know,

526
00:28:37.271 --> 00:28:41.940
when your kids look like they look like your kids look like you.
So well,

527
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:45.360
we've solved that issue here today.
Uh,
yeah.
Dot.
She's a,

528
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:48.280
she's an absolutely terrific,
and she,
uh,
she,
uh,

529
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:53.340
from Idaho and that's where we've good stock.
Yeah.
We moved back there.
Yeah.

530
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.480
Beautiful Man in New York.
So at quarter lane,
man,
that lake up there,

531
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:01.200
I was holy shit.
That was just up there.
And it is fantastic.
And other places,

532
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.280
McCall red fish lake,
you know,
pay it like just beautiful,
beautiful,
stunning,

533
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.540
just stunning part of the country.
Do you guys get a lot of wolves up there?
Uh,

534
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.760
yeah.
And they delisted walls because,
right.
So,
you know,

535
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.080
if get a wolf problem,
shoot the fucker.
But,
um,
it's,
you know,

536
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.100
people don't understand that.
It's just like people,
you know,

537
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:23.490
people trying to dictate what you do with public lands when they have no

538
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:25.540
experience dealing with public lands and their state.
You know,

539
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.040
and that's kind of the way things work nowadays.
Uh,
but yeah,
she,
uh,

540
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.950
she from Idaho went back east.
I met her out there,
uh,

541
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:37.020
when she was working with us,
a lobbying firm.
And I came home one day from uh,

542
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.320
from,
uh,
we were living in,
in new Canaan,
Connecticut,

543
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:42.160
which is a nice little town outside

544
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.611
<v 2>of New York,</v>

545
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:45.700
but I was on metro north riding the train back and forth where my office is in

546
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.770
midtown,
walked in the door.
So,
you know,

547
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:50.590
I don't think I have to be here to do what what I do,

548
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.650
which is basically you just travel for the,
for the business.

549
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.710
And within a week she had the house in the market.

550
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.660
Within five weeks we were settled in Idaho.
Wow.
Fantastic.
Yeah,
it worked out.

551
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.270
<v 0>Did you know anybody out there,
you just,</v>

552
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.451
<v 2>I,
you know,
I didn't,</v>

553
00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:07.050
we'd been going out there to hunt and fish and raft and climb and ski over the

554
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.660
past handful of years.
So I knew the area,

555
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.220
but I didn't know anybody but she knew a lot of people.
She,
and so,
you know,

556
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.470
we've settled in very nicely.

557
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.880
<v 0>It's so calm out there and that's the thing that people don't appreciate.</v>

558
00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:21.080
The folks that are like stuck in the rat race of la or New York or anywhere with

559
00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:22.100
is unbelievable.

560
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.360
Like the piece that you can get in a place like Montana or Idaho,

561
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.140
it's just beauty of the nature.
It's something that if you can do it,

562
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.450
I mean,
if you don't have a job that requires you to be in a city,

563
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.260
<v 2>right?
And then,
you know,
more and more people I think have,
you know,</v>

564
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.420
have the opportunity sometimes to be able to do that.

565
00:30:41.421 --> 00:30:44.000
But you can fool yourself into thinking that I gotta be here.

566
00:30:44.001 --> 00:30:45.530
I got to be in this,
this epicenter,

567
00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:49.490
whether it's Los Angeles or Chicago in New York or wherever,
and,
you know,

568
00:30:49.491 --> 00:30:52.130
because hey,
it's an important place.
And so therefore I'm important,
you know?

569
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.360
But I,
you know,
I sat on that train,
you know,
long enough going back and forth to,

570
00:30:56.361 --> 00:31:00.110
to realize I wasn't that important.
So I figured,
Hey,
it's time to move.

571
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.150
But it's worked out.
The quality of life is,
you know,

572
00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.000
I sound like I'm with the Boise,
Idaho Chamber of Commerce.

573
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.340
<v 0>It's beautiful.
Boise's beautiful.
It's clean air and people,</v>

574
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.870
<v 2>Nice,
great live music,
good bars and restaurants.
It's a,
it's,
you know,</v>

575
00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:15.460
Bsu is there a Boise State University?
Uh,
so it's,
it's,

576
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:19.070
it's just the right size.
And I got three little boys and I tell you what,

577
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.700
you know,
we're out in the fishing,
uh,
you know,
five minutes from the house.

578
00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:25.760
We're up in the foothills.
Uh,
you know,
when they're old enough,
you know,

579
00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:28.100
the hunting is great,
so that'll be good.

580
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.700
<v 0>Yeah.
Idaho is beautiful.</v>

581
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.190
There's a lot of great parts of this country that don't get enough credit.

582
00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:35.010
Everybody likes to call the flyover states,
you know,

583
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.700
fly over between New York and La.
Yeah.

584
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.830
It's pretty weird.
It's weird.
But I think also because for the longest time,

585
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.510
culturally,
those spots weren't as rich.
But now because of the Internet,

586
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.140
everything has changed.
We were talking about this the other day,
people just,

587
00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:55.500
they're not hicks anymore in the middle.
Right.
It's not the same.

588
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:58.380
It's not like nobody has books like everybody's online.

589
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.070
Like the little level of intelligence and awareness of the average folks,

590
00:32:02.071 --> 00:32:05.790
like just in the middle of the country.
It's way different than it was 2013.

591
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.030
<v 2>Right.
The flow of information much better.
And that's,
and that's helping them.</v>

592
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:13.790
And then,
but you can,
you know,
I spent,
uh,
what about seven years,
uh,
in,

593
00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.220
in the northeast and the New York City area.
And you know,

594
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.060
people in that area.
I got wonderful friends there,
but,

595
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.660
but a lot of folks can believe that the rest of the country thinks like they do.

596
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.270
And,
and,
and,
or that they should,

597
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.320
because they just don't know any better because they're not right there.

598
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.950
They're not in the heartbeat of America as they would refer to it.
And you know,

599
00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:39.650
you get outside that northeast corridor and in Washington DC in particular in

600
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:42.630
Washington d C it so far up its own ass that,
you know,

601
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.190
you realize that all this country and that's one of these things with this

602
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:49.670
travel channel show,
that's a pretty good plug,
wasn't it?
Um,

603
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.780
the great thing about that is being able to just go out and travel and see how

604
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.040
great this country is and how it,
like you said,
how many places there are to see.

605
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.280
And,
you know,
I spend most of my life overseas.

606
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:05.750
And so for me it's a real treat because we're going all over hell and back and

607
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:10.160
just,
it's,
it's an incredible country.
When you try to leave the CIA,

608
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:14.720
did they go,
um,
you sure do they go,
uh,

609
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.460
do you really want to do that?
Um,
what are you going to do when you go out?

610
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.590
You going to get on TV?
What are you going to talk about Mike?
Yeah,
they did.

611
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:24.200
I got a great relationship with them and,
and uh,
and I,

612
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.700
I'm one of those guys that,
you know,

613
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:29.090
I have a hard time being objective sometimes about it,
although I try not to,

614
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.000
you know,
uh,
look through rose colored glasses every time.
You know,

615
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:34.010
I'm talking about operations and things that they're doing,

616
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:37.610
but I had a great time and I got a lot of respect for the people there.

617
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.330
And so when I got ready to leave and I left for a pretty simple reason,

618
00:33:41.331 --> 00:33:44.980
I've got a daughter who's in college.
Terrific,
terrific kid.
Um,

619
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.210
and I was just never home when she was growing up.

620
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.960
And so we got to a certain point where I didn't have a choice,
I had to be home.

621
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.630
And so,
um,
I,

622
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.600
I walked in and I was overseas at the time and I walked into my,
uh,
my,

623
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:02.600
my boss who was very senior,
um,
in the operations group and I said,

624
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.720
I think it's time to leave.
And he said,
what are you gonna do?
You can't,

625
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.880
you can't leave,
you know,
and to just stick around.

626
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.630
And he knew I was getting antsy and,
and he said,
God,
stick around it,
you know,

627
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:12.340
it's gonna get better.

628
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.830
Cause we had gotten a little bit risk averse at that point and it gets a little

629
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:18.050
wearing after a while to be working on operations.

630
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:20.000
And then all of a sudden at the,
at the last minute people say,
no,

631
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:22.850
we can't do that too much.
Blow back.
And then you pull back and think,

632
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:23.960
well what the fuck was out all about?

633
00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:27.170
Like what kind of risk or risk of her can you talk about operations?
Yeah,

634
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:27.941
I mean a lot of times it's,

635
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:32.180
it's just political blowback concern over what a host country might say.
If,
if,

636
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.870
if something went south,
yeah.
If,
you know,
if something went south,

637
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:39.650
if you're operating in another country and something you're about to do,
uh,

638
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:40.700
you know,
blows up on you.

639
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.480
And then the political blowback from country to country dealing with that.

640
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.770
And so that oftentimes as a sort of thing that people think about.
But anyway,
so,

641
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:53.060
so this guy,
a great,
great,
great character,
um,
and terrific experience,
uh,

642
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:57.470
with the agency.
He said,
stick around.
So anyway,
long story short,
I went back to,

643
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:02.390
uh,
to Virginia,
uh,
resigned,
um,
to,
uh,
to start a business.

644
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.440
And,
um,
uh,
woke up the next morning and the guy had said,

645
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.460
you're going to feel terrible if you do this.
If you go back and you're resigned,

646
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.060
you're going to feel terrible when you wake up.

647
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.470
And so I woke up and I felt pretty damn good.
So,
so I called him overseas.

648
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:17.630
It was towards the end of the day of his time.
And I said,

649
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.650
I gotta tell you I'd feel great.
And he said,
I want a dick.
And so,
uh,

650
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:25.160
but he's gotten out since he's retired and now he's in business and we get

651
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:28.280
together a lot and he says,
yeah,
some of the worst advice ever gave anybody,

652
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.670
but it was it,
you know,
it was uh,
it was,

653
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.730
it was not easy leaving because you know,
you have a huge amount of respect,

654
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:38.880
you spend a lot of time,
you know,
in there and you're doing things,
um,
that,

655
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:42.120
you know,
sometimes you're doing things that you know,
nobody else is doing.

656
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.740
There's nobody else doing this right now.

657
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.130
I remember having that feeling of walking away from something and thinking

658
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.750
that's it.
I'm the only person that's just done this right now.
And it's pretty,

659
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:53.330
it's pretty special thing.
And that's kind of,

660
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.910
they draw you in that way because you know the of the challenge and the

661
00:35:56.911 --> 00:35:59.700
patriotism and all the rest of it and that's exactly how it should be.
You know,

662
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:01.290
nobody does it for the money.
That's for sure.

663
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.420
<v 0>If there is one bit of controversy or that the main controversy,</v>

664
00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:07.580
the main conspiracy when it comes to the CIA,

665
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:12.640
it's drugs and the main evil conspiracy is that the CIA was involved in selling

666
00:36:14.001 --> 00:36:19.001
drugs and African American communities to fund foreign wars.

667
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:23.870
The contras in Nicaragua,
you know the whole thing with Oliver North,
you know,

668
00:36:23.871 --> 00:36:27.410
with uh,
freeway,
Ricky Ross,
the guy who is out now,

669
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.420
he was involved directly with selling drugs.
The money went straight to the CIA.

670
00:36:32.421 --> 00:36:34.910
The CIA used that money.
You're shaking your head.

671
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.610
<v 2>Get my head.
Yeah,
you don't believe it.
Now look,
I,</v>

672
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.610
I spent a long enough time behind the curtain and,
and I met Chris.
What,

673
00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:42.110
what are people going to,

674
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.590
if people who are down that road are going to be listening to this guy to go

675
00:36:45.591 --> 00:36:48.170
with a five course,
he's going to say that.
I mean,
what else is he going to say?

676
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:52.660
But honest to God,
I'd,
I'd spend enough time behind the curtain,
um,
in a,

677
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:57.670
in operations the whole time to say that we've got a lot of restrictions on us

678
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.360
in terms of what we can do,

679
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:02.960
who we can deal with and what you're able to accomplish.

680
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:07.730
And um,
yeah,
the,
the whole concept of the drug thing.

681
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.770
I don't know when that got started.

682
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:12.950
I don't know how it sort of popped up initially,

683
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.590
but it takes on a life of its own,
like everything else,

684
00:37:15.591 --> 00:37:19.550
like theories about the Kennedy assassination like we were talking about.
Um,

685
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:24.170
and you're never going to let him go away and sometimes saying that,
you know,

686
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.780
if I sit here and protests,
people going to say,

687
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:28.810
well of course they must be true because he's protests.

688
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:32.720
Is it possible the things went on that you don't know about?
Oh,
absolutely not.

689
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.400
How would that happen?
No,
of course there is.
Yeah.
But,
but at the same time,
yeah.

690
00:37:37.401 --> 00:37:41.910
But at the same time,
I will say this much,
uh,

691
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.910
people can't keep their Yap shut will over a period of tiles is,
I'm sorry,
what?

692
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:51.680
<v 0>No.
Barry Seal's is very seals like dead now,
but Barry seal was,</v>

693
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.610
he was a fighter who was a pilot rather,
and a,
a drug smuggler.

694
00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.700
And he said that he flew covert flights for the Central Intelligence Agency must

695
00:38:01.251 --> 00:38:03.710
be limited.
Eat.
Well,
he's dead now.
He died.

696
00:38:03.711 --> 00:38:07.340
He was assassinated when he was on his way to testify with George Bush phone

697
00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:10.430
number in his pocket.
That's the Salacious d test,
that details,

698
00:38:10.431 --> 00:38:12.070
and that's got to be true,
right?

699
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:17.170
He had photographs with a CIA agents and met a gene cartel officers.

700
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.270
I mean,
he without a doubt was a drug runner.

701
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.930
The question is whether he was actually running drugs for the CIA.

702
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.310
<v 2>Yeah.
I feel comfortable being here and saying,
no,</v>

703
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.660
of course you got to say that.
But also,
I mean,
and again,
you're right.

704
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.770
The more times I say it,
people didn't go well ski.

705
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:38.750
It's gotta be true because he's saying it so often.
Um,
but I,
you know,
I,
uh,

706
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.200
the agency is,
is operated by humans just like everything else.

707
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.640
And so it's never going to be perfect.
It's never gonna be perfect.

708
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:50.570
There will be a slip ups,
Iran Contra,
you know,
um,

709
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.070
the whole decision to nation build in Iraq and what that meant.

710
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.400
Although the agency,
you know,
it doesn't drive policy,
so I'm not sure what,
what,

711
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.170
what?
That's good.

712
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.530
<v 0>Well the Iran Contra thing is directly connected to selling drugs in poor</v>

713
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:05.350
neighborhoods in la.
Yeah,
but freeway,

714
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:10.351
Ricky Ross like literally sold hundreds of millions of dollars for the drugs,

715
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.730
but not for the agency.
Well he says that that's how he got a hold of the drugs

716
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:21.670
to the agency.
Yeah.
But that's,
I guess that's my point.
If I'm,
if I'm a dirt bag,

717
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.060
<v 2>yeah.
What am I going to do?</v>

718
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.640
I'm going to complicate things and muddy the waters because I'm going to say,

719
00:39:26.641 --> 00:39:27.690
well my God,
I did it

720
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.070
<v 0>for the government.
I did it either for the ACA,
didn't have read partial.</v>

721
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.840
I did it for the secret service freeway.

722
00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:36.740
Ricky Ross didn't even realize he was selling drugs for the CIA until he was in

723
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:39.860
jail.
He didn't know who the connections war that he was getting.

724
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.390
What's interesting about Barry Seal,

725
00:39:41.391 --> 00:39:45.830
the guy who died is that he was an informant for the DEA,
the DEA,

726
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.210
as you were talking about,

727
00:39:47.211 --> 00:39:50.180
the CIA and the FBI have like a little combative relationship.

728
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.930
So to the DEA and the CIA,
there's all sorts of interagency.

729
00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:00.190
<v 2>I worked with the DEA overseas and,
and uh,
in counter narcotics operations.</v>

730
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:03.940
And again,
yeah,
I mean,
part of it is,
is,
uh,

731
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.420
going back to the same thing we talked about with the bureau relationships

732
00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.200
during those early days,
starting out,
working with them overseas,

733
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.620
there was a lot of kind of p and on each other's turf relationship is much

734
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:18.010
better now.
But I guess all I'm saying is,
and I'll,
I'll,
I'll leave it at that,

735
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:18.844
is that the agency

736
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.370
was not in the business of selling drugs.

737
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.210
If we wanted money to fund operations,

738
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.730
we had other recourses day to gather that money rather than narcotics and

739
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:38.731
selling drugs to a lower income neighborhoods in the United States of America.

740
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.210
I just,
it's just to me,

741
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.150
I understand you're never going to shift people off a certain position and

742
00:40:43.151 --> 00:40:47.140
people are going to believe what they're going to believe.
But,
um,

743
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.000
it kind of goes back to what I said at the very beginning.

744
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.540
The number one misconception is that this agency is at the fuck people over.

745
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.670
<v 0>Yeah.
This,</v>

746
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.590
this Barry seal one is a very interesting one because he had so much information

747
00:40:57.591 --> 00:41:02.330
about the CIA and so much information about the Medellin cartel and drug dealing

748
00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:03.140
in the first place.

749
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:07.610
What he had actually said led people to believe that he was a guy who is very

750
00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:09.590
knowledgeable about the actual operations.

751
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:14.090
It's the number one piece of evidence that points to the CIA.

752
00:41:14.091 --> 00:41:16.790
And then w what happened with Michael Rupert,
Michael [inaudible],

753
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:20.240
who was a former La narcotics officer of busted people and he,

754
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:25.250
do you know what Mike,
you've been down every rabbit hole there.
He's got to say,

755
00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:29.840
man,
you,
man,
you've been spending a lot of time down the rabbit,
Warren.
Um,
yeah.

756
00:41:29.841 --> 00:41:34.000
You know,
again,
uh,
we're,
we're going to just be at loggerheads at it

757
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.090
<v 2>on this one because I,
you know,
I keep going back to the same thing.</v>

758
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:40.160
I understand why,
why people find it interesting.

759
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:41.910
I don't understand why people believe,
okay,
I'm going to,

760
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.210
this is what I'm going to choose to believe.
Uh,

761
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:47.270
I got a different perspective based on a lot of life experience inside the

762
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:51.470
organization.
And if I saw a shit that I thought was absolutely,
you know,
tenable,

763
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.030
then yeah,

764
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.690
I'd like to think I'm a decent enough person and I don't have a dog in the hunt.

765
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.010
I'm not bound by anything other than a respect for the organization based on the

766
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:03.860
experience I've had with them.
So anyway,

767
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.240
but that's exactly what people would actually

768
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.890
<v 0>take me to say.
Well,
the guy who was the head of the CIA,</v>

769
00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:12.150
the director of Central Intelligence Agency in [inaudible] 96 was Don John

770
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:16.470
Deutch.
That's how you say his name,
Deutsche.
Uh,
he was,
uh,
in Los Angeles.

771
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.800
He was at a town hall meeting,
and Michael Rupert,

772
00:42:19.801 --> 00:42:22.740
who was a former La narcotics officer who was an officer at the time,

773
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:28.100
confronted him saying that in his experience as an LAPD narcotics officer,

774
00:42:28.231 --> 00:42:32.040
he had seen evidence of the CIA complicity and drug dealing and the

775
00:42:32.041 --> 00:42:34.710
confrontation was handled so poorly by doors.

776
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.920
It resulted in him being terminated from the CIA.

777
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.600
<v 2>Did resulted in Deutsche Bank Terminator?
No.</v>

778
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:49.670
Why was he terminated?
Wow.
Because he was a,
this wasn't good.
It just wasn't good.

779
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.490
He was acknowledged along with Stansfield Turner and a couple of others of being

780
00:42:53.491 --> 00:42:58.260
not our most,
uh,
effective,
uh,
beloved directors.
You know,

781
00:42:58.261 --> 00:43:01.770
that's not,
I don't want to besmirch anybody's character,
but at the same time,

782
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:06.120
the idea that,
wow,
what was,
it was on television,

783
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.700
but it was in Glasgow as a director.
No.

784
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.070
<v 0>You ever seen the video of Rupert confronting him?</v>

785
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.080
<v 2>Uh,
no I haven't,
but I,
I've,
I've watched it.
I've dealt with John Deutch.</v>

786
00:43:16.081 --> 00:43:20.320
I've been there when John Deutch was there.
Now,
eh?
Nah,
mean,
you know,

787
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.350
you always have favorites.
It's like anything else.

788
00:43:22.351 --> 00:43:25.440
I have my favorite boss at the company or I got my favorite and you know,

789
00:43:25.441 --> 00:43:29.120
I've got my favorite directors for sure.
It's your favorite podcaster.
Oh,

790
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.020
it's gotta be this Rogan Guy.

791
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:36.180
I mean it's coffees outstanding and uh,
yeah,
but no,
it's,

792
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:38.520
it's uh,
it,
it is what it is.

793
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.060
I mean I played this one thing for you and then we'll let it go.
But

794
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.760
<v 0>Rupert Confronting John Doyle,
pull that,
pull this up Jamie.</v>

795
00:43:45.761 --> 00:43:48.270
Cause it's pretty fascinating.
Wash this and okay.

796
00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.970
<v 4>This is when I will tell you director Deutsch as a former Los Angeles police,</v>

797
00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:52.960
narcotics detective,

798
00:43:52.961 --> 00:43:55.530
that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for sure.

799
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:09.340
People are clapping.
So it must be true.
It must be true.
Yeah.

800
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.920
It's a crowd pleasing statement.

801
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:18.540
My hobby has weighed.
That is an answer for a lot of you.
Enough.
Can you please,

802
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.470
I refer now.
Can you please,
I referred her.
Wait,
wait,

803
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:27.100
wait,
wait a minute.

804
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.370
This chick's not good at her job.
No.

805
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.560
Wait a minute.

806
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.460
What's going on here?
Please leave now.
That's a good way to

807
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.240
get a Mcdonald's here.
What's going on by the CIA?

808
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:55.130
Narcotics booth on your way out.
Pick up your coat now.

809
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:59.640
We'll come back to you as we roll back across to the center section.

810
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.480
Yeah,
director of Deutsche.

811
00:45:03.481 --> 00:45:08.481
I will refer you to three specific agency operations known as Amadeus,

812
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.780
Pegasus and watchtower.

813
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.650
I know my own ass documents heavily redacted by the agency.

814
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:18.390
I was personally exposed to CIA operations and recruited by CIA personnel who

815
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:22.680
attempted to recruit me in the late seventies to become involved in protecting

816
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:24.840
agency drunk operations in this country.

817
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.230
I had been trying to get this out for 18 years and I have the evidence.

818
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:30.120
My question,
if he was very specific,
sir.

819
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.440
If in the course of the igs investigations and Fred hits his work,

820
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:39.890
you'll come across evidence of severely criminal activity and it's classified.

821
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:40.981
Well,

822
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:44.610
you use that classification to hide the criminal activity or will you tell the

823
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:45.780
American people the truth?

824
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:52.450
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

825
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.010
<v 4>why did you want to hear the response first from Julian tax on that then from</v>

826
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.883
the director,

827
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:02.893
<v 5>right?</v>

828
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.460
<v 4>Why
from your,
from your,</v>

829
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.380
I'm sorry,

830
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.680
<v 2>z.
You could pause it here.
He basically said what he needed to say.
Yeah.</v>

831
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.200
So what do you think?
That kind of shit,
that's the first guy who ever claimed it,

832
00:46:20.201 --> 00:46:23.560
had been tried to be recruited by the Seattle.
He's a la narcotics officer.

833
00:46:23.561 --> 00:46:27.990
I mean,
he's a legitimate guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah.
Okay.
That's,
that's I,

834
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:33.640
I look at it and I see the same thing I see in,
in,
uh,
in,

835
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.480
uh,
a lot of other cases.
You have sort of a,

836
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:39.760
a delusion thing going on at delusion of grandeur.
You've got sort of,

837
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.240
we see it all the time in,
in guys like,
uh,
I'm not,

838
00:46:43.241 --> 00:46:44.980
I'm not putting them in the same category,
don't get me wrong.

839
00:46:44.981 --> 00:46:48.730
But guys like Hanson,
guys like Jim Nicholson,
uh,
ed Lee,
Howard,
all these things,

840
00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.950
people never listen to me.
If they just listened to me,

841
00:46:50.951 --> 00:46:53.230
things would have been better.
So therefore the man's out to fuck me,

842
00:46:53.231 --> 00:46:57.050
therefore I'm going to fuck the man.
And that's typically in the agency,
has a,

843
00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.200
is a beautiful shining light up there on,

844
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.040
on the hill to take a shot at because it's so intriguing.

845
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.420
Nobody fights back.

846
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.930
That's one of the reasons why the agency is always getting kicked in the ass up

847
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:10.600
on Capitol Hill.
We don't,
we don't push back because we're not,

848
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.550
you're not in a position to,
what are you going to go,

849
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.160
go back up there and start talking about twice methods again,

850
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.750
getting back to this guy,
uh,
yeah,
I hold absolutely no credibility in it.

851
00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:23.560
I can guarantee you that Deutsche was not let go because of his response or lack

852
00:47:23.561 --> 00:47:27.550
thereof to,
uh,
that,
uh,
particular rant.
So,

853
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.040
but it doesn't,
I'm going to sit here.

854
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:32.320
It's just like me saying this is how Kennedy was killed.

855
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:33.820
It's not gonna make any difference.

856
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:36.370
So everyone's going to believe what they're going to believe.
Again,

857
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.600
I go back to the same thing.

858
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.430
Somebody pushing that Theiri as their own life experience.

859
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.520
I've got a life experience,
which you,
I was fortunate enough,

860
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:47.870
gave me access inside an organization that I,
you know,

861
00:47:47.871 --> 00:47:52.540
that I think gave me an understanding as to how they operate and the ethics with

862
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:57.040
which they have,
even though people say ethics,
the agency,
I mean,
again,

863
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.920
as an example,
people,
people went nuts over the interrogation thing.

864
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.690
If you mean the waterboarding,
waterboarding stuff.
If anybody had taken the time,

865
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:09.520
all those critics who were taking the time to read the Dlj memos that,
uh,

866
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:13.510
holders,
the Justice Department,
uh,
decided we were great to release,

867
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.000
then they,

868
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.400
you can't not come away from reading seriously the DOJ memos and not say,

869
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:24.280
well,
shit,
every little thing,

870
00:48:24.281 --> 00:48:27.610
they were going back and forth trying to see is this appropriate?
Can we do this?

871
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:31.720
Can we can't do that?
Okay,
can we do this?
Okay,
can I,
uh,

872
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:35.140
push him against a fake wall?
All I can't,
can I do the following?

873
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.720
And there's back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.

874
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:42.550
And it belies as a notion that somehow we just out there fucking over the world

875
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:47.530
and acting like a bunch of cowboys.
Um,
so,
but again,
you know,

876
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:48.671
it's,
it's,

877
00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:51.600
it's like the agency going up on Capitol Hill and trying to defend itself.
It,

878
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.250
what are you going to do?
People are going to believe what they believe.

879
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.490
<v 0>What if I was going to give you advice though in the future?
I mean,</v>

880
00:48:57.491 --> 00:49:00.880
obviously you don't need my advice when someone brings up something,

881
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:01.810
even if it's ridiculous.

882
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.580
Don't laugh while you discredit it because it makes it look like a bullshit.

883
00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:09.340
And you know,
like when people do that,
they go off.
That's ridiculous.
No,
I know.

884
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:12.040
I know.
And I think you're right.
I think you're right.
But what you will,

885
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.530
but you also have to,
you also have to realize that it is ridiculous.

886
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.320
It is ridiculous to me.
So I'm going to,

887
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.110
I'm going to react the way it's natural for me to read rogue agents that were

888
00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:22.750
involved.
I mean,
we see it all the time when narcotics officers,

889
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:27.500
that's a big thing with narcotics officers.
They get involved,
they go undercover,

890
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.910
they start selling drugs,
they start doing drugs and then they say,
you know what?

891
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:32.650
These motherfuckers are making millions of dollars.

892
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.810
I'm going to make it a little piece on the side for myself.

893
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:39.040
Put it away somewhere in a safe deposit box,
live off of it or whatever.
I mean,

894
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:41.650
it does happen.
People do get corrupted.
Yeah,
of course people get

895
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.880
<v 2>corrupted.
I don't,
back to your point,</v>

896
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.470
was I the director of the agency?
No.
So do I know everything that goes on?
No.

897
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.020
What am I saying?
I'm saying based on my experience,

898
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:56.160
based on a lot of time behind the curtain and and working in a lot of

899
00:49:56.161 --> 00:50:00.480
operational environments and dealing with a lot of people over 17 years,

900
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:05.280
uh,
no.
To me,
I,
I don't buy,
it doesn't make any sense.

901
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:07.260
I don't believe it.
But you know,
again,

902
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.780
I got to leave it at that because you know,
a,
anything in this world as possible.

903
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.490
I don't believe it's possible.
I,
I,

904
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.190
but that's exactly what people expect me to say.

905
00:50:17.191 --> 00:50:18.630
I keep going back to that same force.

906
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.790
<v 0>Is there a no always an issue as well with in order to adequately protect the</v>

907
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:29.851
United States interests in order to adequately act in secrecy in the interest of

908
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:34.550
the United States,
people in government,
you kind of,
there's,

909
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:38.510
there's always going to be like walls that people come up against where to do

910
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:39.410
your job.

911
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.770
I would imagine if you're involved in something that requires a certain amount

912
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:46.940
of secrecy,
it can't discuss certain things.
So when things come along,

913
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:49.370
when Congress wants to have answers to questions like,

914
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.720
do you know what the Glo Mar,

915
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:55.070
you know what Glo Mar is like a Glo Mar response global marine.

916
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:58.280
Do you remember when that Russian submarine?
Yeah,

917
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.640
there was a Russian submarine that the United States was trying to recover as a

918
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.590
nuclear submarine and um,

919
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.040
Global Marine was a company that was trying to pull this down.
Yeah,

920
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:09.890
it was a great operation.
They were trying to pull this thing out of the ocean,

921
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:12.890
but it was an incredible operation by miles deep.

922
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:17.360
There's millions of pounds of metal and they had to pull this nuclear sub up and

923
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:20.630
they were trying to get all this information about the capabilities of these

924
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:22.710
Russian subs.
What,
you know,
what kind of,
um,

925
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.060
documents were on board and it was right after Watergate.

926
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.280
So because there was so much,

927
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.760
so much blow back against secrecy because of Watergate,

928
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.450
because everybody had assumed that the United States will now we find out that

929
00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:38.660
Nixon was spying on people and he's kicked out of office.

930
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.960
So the global marine response to this was we can neither confirm nor deny,

931
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:46.340
and that's where that term came from.

932
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:51.341
We can neither confirm nor deny it came out of them having to come up with some

933
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:53.720
sort of response because the freedom of Information Act,

934
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.430
they required them to do so.

935
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.510
So they came up with this way to respond but not responding.

936
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.210
<v 2>Does anybody do any good because it came out in the press anyway,
eventually.</v>

937
00:52:01.211 --> 00:52:03.620
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
It did.
Yeah.
Pretty quickly.
But

938
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:07.450
<v 0>doesn't that kind of highlight like how difficult it is?
I mean,
look,
this is it.</v>

939
00:52:07.451 --> 00:52:08.520
That's a perfect example.

940
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.360
You're dealing with a Russian submarines during the Cold War.
We're,

941
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:14.160
we're worried we're going to go to war with Russia.
If we,
you know,

942
00:52:14.161 --> 00:52:17.910
who the f w why do we have to tell you if we found a fucking Russian sub that's

943
00:52:17.911 --> 00:52:19.230
got nuclear missiles,
then it,
well,

944
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:23.160
why should we have to tell the American people and also informed the Soviet

945
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.980
Union and then they go and find out where we're doing this and then they find

946
00:52:25.981 --> 00:52:28.500
out that we have their sub,
it fucks up everything.
Right,

947
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.050
<v 2>right.
Well,
I mean,
you know,
decade after decade,
it becomes,</v>

948
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.080
it becomes less likely that the government's going to keep deep secrets.

949
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.580
Right.
Because it just,
the way information flows and,

950
00:52:38.581 --> 00:52:42.170
and the access to information and with the Internet and just also this does

951
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:46.740
general inability anymore of officials to,
to keep their Yap shut.
So,

952
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.490
you know,
I mean,
you look at,
look at Fdr for crying out loud,
depressive great.
Uh,

953
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:54.320
you know,
not say anything about his in his,
uh,
his handicap,
you know,
and,

954
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:58.740
and so for several years it was just,
that was kept under wraps.

955
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.360
You can't do that if you're not going to do that anymore.
I mean,
and,

956
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.020
and so you look at this and you think,
well,
yeah,
I mean we can't,

957
00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.410
the idea that the government,
and that's a good thing.

958
00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:09.570
And in a sense of good idea that the government's going to keep,
you know,

959
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.550
big secrets from people.
There's a tendency to just talk.
I mean,

960
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.790
for crying out loud,
the New York Times,

961
00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:16.770
half the time the front page is made up of,
of,
you know,

962
00:53:16.771 --> 00:53:20.880
front page stories with nothing but anonymous sources and they can't be quoted

963
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.070
or they can't be identified because we're not supposed to talk about it.

964
00:53:23.071 --> 00:53:25.560
Well then don't fucking talk about it.
If you've signed agreement,

965
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:27.660
if you signed a deal that says you're not going to talk about something,

966
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.930
you know,
shut your pie hole,
or if you feel that strongly about it,

967
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:32.820
get the fuck out and then talk about it.

968
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:38.070
<v 3>What do you,
how do you feel about guys like Edward Snowden guys?
Yeah.
Funny.</v>

969
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.240
Yeah.
It's funny.
See,
I laugh when I get irritated.
He irritating.
Yeah,

970
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:43.074
he's irritating.

971
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:47.000
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
you know,
again,
uh,
you know,</v>

972
00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.660
everyone's going to disagree over this.
I'm a small government person,

973
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:54.661
so I agree that you got to have checks and balances and I believe a,

974
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:56.710
a handful of things.
One of them being is that,

975
00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.900
and people aren't going to believe this because they watched a lot of movies and

976
00:53:58.901 --> 00:54:02.440
beach books and shit and they done a lot of rabbit holes,

977
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.220
but the u s intel communities the most transparent until community on the
planet,

978
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.540
right?
Maybe that sets the bar pretty low compared to other services,
right?

979
00:54:10.541 --> 00:54:15.370
That's saying like,
you're the nicest rapist.
Exactly.
She's your great stalker.
Um,

980
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:20.050
and uh,
so I think that it's,
it's,
um,
for me

981
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.670
the idea that a,
that Snowden had,
um,

982
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:29.830
signed agreements and then chose to do what he did,

983
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.600
um,
disappeared into,
uh,

984
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:37.180
into the PRC and then now is over in Russia.

985
00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:42.400
Um,
and despite people wanting to wave the flag and saying he's a hero,

986
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.020
uh,
on a certain level,
uh,
it's caused a great deal of damage.

987
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.000
And I think that gift,

988
00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:52.270
he was that distraught over this.

989
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:57.610
Then there were other avenues that he could have pursued to,
um,

990
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.690
to bring this to light.
And I think that what he's done is very damaging.

991
00:55:01.691 --> 00:55:06.440
I understand why people,
you know,
beat the drum for him.
I get that.
Um,

992
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:07.323
again,

993
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:12.310
my opinion is based on certain life experiences.
So,

994
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.800
you know,
we're never gonna meet in the middle on this one.

995
00:55:14.801 --> 00:55:16.260
The importance of secrecy,

996
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:20.190
as long those losses into your word and what the sort of damage does it,

997
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:24.450
some of this information actually does out in the field in terms of,
of,

998
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:29.110
of what that means.
Um,
and so yeah,
I,

999
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:31.900
again,
I'm kind of conflicted in a way because I agree.

1000
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.790
You gotta you gotta keep things in check,
you know,

1001
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:38.791
and you got to end and you've got to have the ability to understand what the

1002
00:55:39.881 --> 00:55:43.100
government is doing in this regard.
Um,

1003
00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:46.840
I think that the best way to do that has had a very,
um,

1004
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:51.940
inquisitive and proactive,
um,
political base.

1005
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.840
Congress and Senate should do their jobs.
And part of it is,
you know,

1006
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.630
there's a game that goes on in Washington where every time something like this

1007
00:55:58.631 --> 00:56:00.880
comes out and it's politically expedient for them to do so,

1008
00:56:00.881 --> 00:56:04.120
they express outrage and Angst and Oh my God,
I can't believe this is happening.

1009
00:56:04.121 --> 00:56:08.350
And there's a well worn path between the Intel community and Capitol Hill with

1010
00:56:08.351 --> 00:56:12.440
people going up in briefing these people all the time on the lunch Snowden's

1011
00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:16.390
case,
what he's talking about is them spying on every single American.

1012
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:20.970
<v 3>That's essentially what it is.
Yeah.</v>

1013
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.160
Don't you think that people have a right to privacy if they're just innocent

1014
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.650
<v 0>folks that a tax payers and they're not breaking the law,</v>

1015
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:27.820
they're not doing anything.

1016
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:31.140
<v 2>I think that there's a there,
there is that and I don't disagree with,</v>

1017
00:56:31.141 --> 00:56:34.250
that's why Sam conflicted on,
on the,
on the whole issue.
I'm conflicted as well

1018
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:38.440
<v 0>because he did actually pursue different avenues before he released everything.</v>

1019
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:39.670
What he says,
he says he did.

1020
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.110
<v 2>He said he believe them.
No,</v>

1021
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:45.290
there's a lot of characteristics of snow and that remind me of again,

1022
00:56:45.291 --> 00:56:47.640
of some of the other characters in an account intelligence,

1023
00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.160
a world that we dealt with that um,
uh,

1024
00:56:52.161 --> 00:56:53.590
I don't take everything to say it,

1025
00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:57.110
just like this character that we watched on the,
on the video,
just like a rubric.

1026
00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.300
Yeah.
I don't take what they say,
you know,

1027
00:56:59.301 --> 00:57:04.301
for face value now because you're willing to do a certain thing then that makes

1028
00:57:04.731 --> 00:57:09.620
me question your,
um,
your,
your sort of your compass and so,

1029
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.310
but,
but yeah,
I,
the idea that,
uh,
you know,

1030
00:57:13.311 --> 00:57:17.180
the government's collecting metadata now admittedly I could drive a big fucking

1031
00:57:17.181 --> 00:57:20.220
truck load of Metadata,
dump it here on our table and you wouldn't know if shit,

1032
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.780
but it's,
oh,
it's,
it's,
you know,
then again,

1033
00:57:23.781 --> 00:57:25.580
you look at Amazon and Google and you look what they're doing.

1034
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.950
<v 0>Yeah.
But he was saying that people were actually going into people's emails,</v>

1035
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:33.310
extracting naked photographs,
passing them around the office,

1036
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.570
<v 2>Edward Snowden sitting that I,
again,
we're gonna have to fall down on that.
This,</v>

1037
00:57:38.571 --> 00:57:43.140
this whole thing that I don't believe him saying that all the time.

1038
00:57:43.141 --> 00:57:46.410
I was involved in things.
I never saw behavior like that.

1039
00:57:46.411 --> 00:57:50.030
And we dealt with NSA a fair amount and on the technical collection side,
right.

1040
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.070
So,
but at the same time,
I understand,
you know,

1041
00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.130
people are gonna believe a different thing.

1042
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:59.520
I think it's important for us to have these conversations.

1043
00:57:59.521 --> 00:58:01.530
I think it's important for us to keep the government in check.

1044
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.910
I just think this is,
I disagree with the way that he went about doing it.

1045
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.340
I guess that's,
that's the best thing.
But I don't disagree with,

1046
00:58:08.341 --> 00:58:10.350
with the fact that it's an important conversation.

1047
00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.020
I think you felt like you had no recourse.
Well,
yeah.

1048
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:16.320
I mean that's sort of the Hansen when he started spying for the fucking Soviets.

1049
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.350
So that's always the case.
I didn't have any other choice.

1050
00:58:19.351 --> 00:58:21.960
People weren't listening to me.
Oh my God,
you know,

1051
00:58:21.961 --> 00:58:25.200
I'm not getting the respect I deserve.
This is funny.
They all go to the Soviets,

1052
00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:28.380
right?
He's right over there chilling and Russia and they've got everything.

1053
00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:31.000
He's Guy Glenn Greenwald and,
and,
and Snowden.
He's got to say,

1054
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.430
they only want to talk about how,
no,
no,
we've,
we've safeguarded,
well,

1055
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:38.850
if they're smarter than the fucking PRC and the pla out in China and smarter

1056
00:58:38.851 --> 00:58:42.000
than,
than the FSB and in Russia,
then you know,

1057
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:45.060
when get monkeys on Unicorns are going to fly out my ass.

1058
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:49.230
So I just not buying it.
You,
you mean terms of safeguard,

1059
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.090
safeguard in there very important secret information,
intelligence perspective,

1060
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.220
all that shit that he's walked out the door with.
His is in the hands of the,
of,

1061
00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.190
of,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,
people who don't have our interests at heart.
Hard

1062
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:04.360
<v 0>meaning not just what's been released to the concerns about the American people,</v>

1063
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:05.081
about privacy,

1064
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:08.590
but some other stuff that is totally unrelated to privacy that is very
important.

1065
00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:13.360
But yeah,
that,
well,
that can't be argued in my opinion,
that that's very tricky.

1066
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.151
I mean if,

1067
00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:18.190
if that is the case and the data isn't secure and it can compromise people in

1068
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:21.710
the field and all sorts of other things,
but what Americans,

1069
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:26.711
their number one concern was that this is what is an ongoing situation like this

1070
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:30.680
and the NSA,
uh,
the facility that they're building in Utah,

1071
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:32.280
we're going to store all the bay center.
Yeah.

1072
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.690
It scares the shit out of people that every single phone call they make is being

1073
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:37.640
stored somewhere.
Every single email,

1074
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:41.810
every single text message everyone pick they send.

1075
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.750
<v 2>Yeah.
And,
and I think that,
you know,
there again,
there's,
there's ways to go about,</v>

1076
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.540
um,
this ways to go,
but we're supposed to have checks and balances

1077
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.580
<v 0>place.
No one even knew about this until this guy came up.</v>

1078
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:57.910
I also don't necessarily buy that one either.
Um,

1079
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.390
the CIA improperly hacked into Senate computers.
Yeah.
That one is a,

1080
01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.640
you've got to kind of reverse engineer that story.

1081
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.350
<v 2>Um,</v>

1082
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:10.940
they had set up a shared network system between the Senate staffers who were

1083
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:15.941
busy writing what took them over five years and they had a preset agenda on,

1084
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:19.610
on,
uh,
the interrogation history of interrogation by the agency.

1085
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.010
So it took them over five years to write.
But during the course of that,

1086
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:24.210
they set up a shared network,
shared system,
uh,

1087
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.210
for the agency and the Senate staffers who were writing this thing to use.
So,
uh,

1088
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:31.340
at a certain point,
it became clear through

1089
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.620
the course of that process,
that Senate stablish head,
uh,

1090
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.140
acquired,
uh,

1091
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:42.610
documentation that they weren't supposed to have that was above that.
They're,
uh,

1092
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.200
parameters,
the classification,
how they get it.

1093
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.250
That is what then what happened was on this shared system,

1094
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:50.990
not in the Senate computer system,

1095
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:53.930
nobody in the Senate is arguing that it's a shared network that was set up

1096
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:57.780
specifically for this process of sharing documents.
So,
uh,

1097
01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.920
the agency ran what is basically a forensic,
uh,
effort,

1098
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.830
a keyword and phrase search happens every day.

1099
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:07.880
I've got a company diligence for all your information and security needs that,

1100
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.350
you know,
we've got a computer forensics group.

1101
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.230
So keyword phrase searches is a standard forensic tool.

1102
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:15.110
So they went through that to try to figure out how did this document and did

1103
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:19.920
others go walk about.
So that's what that whole,
uh,
who ha was about.
But again,

1104
01:01:19.921 --> 01:01:23.420
it's,
it points to even that level,

1105
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:27.450
even with a Senate Intel Committee where,
which,
you know,
um,

1106
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.880
uh,
again they've got the ability if they would use it,

1107
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:35.640
if they would stay inquisitive,
if they would stay a proactive,
uh,

1108
01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:39.860
they've got the ability to pursue things.
But there's a level of,
of,
uh,

1109
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.910
of distrust sometimes it goes on and it kind of comes back around to this whole

1110
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:48.770
transparency issue.
Um,
you know,
conspiracy,
I don't know,

1111
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.090
there's,
there's always been an,
I keep going back to that same thing.

1112
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:53.480
You asked me that question at the very beginning,
which was terrific.
Which,

1113
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.540
you know,
what's the number one misconception?
Oh,
the agencies at the fuck.

1114
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.970
<v 0>So also your take on,
it was just at the CIA,</v>

1115
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:02.360
was trying to figure out how the Senate acquire these documents that they were

1116
01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:05.500
not supposed to be in the point of their exercise as well

1117
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.310
<v 2>as like from a counterintelligence perspective,</v>

1118
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.060
you then you have to start figuring out what else has walked out the door and

1119
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.060
what the Senate interpreted it as.
Was that,

1120
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:19.100
I guess the agency was pushing back and in an attempt to,
um,

1121
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.083
what,
I dunno,

1122
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:23.700
stop the reporting or the reporting had already gone out this route,

1123
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.400
this massive report that they've already written had gone out.

1124
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:29.700
You'd already gone out to the community for,
for review.
Uh,

1125
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:31.140
he'd gone to the White House for review.

1126
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.040
So it's not as if they were going to try to stop that flow of information.

1127
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.840
They've already done that.
They've already released it.
Well,

1128
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.670
they haven't released it to the,
to the,
uh,

1129
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:41.580
the public because they're now the waiting from the White House for a review.
So,

1130
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.070
I dunno,
uh,
you know,
Eh,
there's

1131
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.600
the agency has a long history of,
uh,

1132
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.900
of being a lightening rod for things because of the nature of its business.

1133
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:02.370
And that's understood.
People work inside the organization understand that.

1134
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:06.000
And,
and,
and,
and I'm outside.
It's why I can express a frustration,

1135
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.290
but I guarantee you when you're inside and you're constantly being thrown out

1136
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:11.700
there as you know,
uh,
uh,

1137
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.740
an evil cabal or selling drugs to a low income neighborhoods or fucking over,

1138
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:18.900
you know,
everybody else are doing,
you know,

1139
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:23.610
working against the interests as opposed to White House delivers tasking and

1140
01:03:23.611 --> 01:03:24.570
says,
get this done.

1141
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.580
And the job of the agency has to march forward regardless of who's in the

1142
01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:30.420
administration.

1143
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.960
And it doesn't matter whether it's President Obama or President Bush,

1144
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:37.950
President Clinton,
President Carter,
doesn't matter.

1145
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.660
They give you the tasking,
you'd do it.

1146
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.500
<v 0>So when you see a situation like this,
we're,</v>

1147
01:03:41.501 --> 01:03:46.501
Dianne Feinstein says that the CIA may have violated the constitution.

1148
01:03:46.851 --> 01:03:50.250
And do you think there's a lot of political grandstanding going on?
Grants and a,

1149
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.300
there is,
yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
I mean it political,

1150
01:03:52.301 --> 01:03:54.690
grand standing and everything that goes on nowadays.
I mean it's,

1151
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.380
it doesn't really matter what he's big speeches.

1152
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.230
It's like to set them up in a position where it looks like they're looking out

1153
01:03:59.231 --> 01:04:01.270
for the American public.
When in reality,

1154
01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:05.740
if they looked at the actual circumstances and the actual facts behind what had

1155
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:09.090
gone on,
it would have been far less.
Or if in other cases

1156
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:12.220
<v 2>are they were,
they were expressing,
oh my God,</v>

1157
01:04:12.221 --> 01:04:15.670
I can't believe this interrogation program is doing this.
Well,
fuck that.

1158
01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.200
We've got briefers it,
like I said,
March,
back and forth and back and forth and,

1159
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:22.750
and,
and,
and,
and explain what's going on and answer questions.
I mean,

1160
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:27.190
the agencies if from the Church Committee on and,
and even prior to that,
uh,

1161
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:30.670
you know,
there's,
there's a long history of,
of sort of this,

1162
01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.570
this game that goes on.
If I'm a politician up on Capitol Hill and I get,

1163
01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:38.350
and I see that this is not going to look good from my constituency back home,

1164
01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:39.580
then I'm going to express surprise.

1165
01:04:39.581 --> 01:04:42.370
Even if I sat on that Intel Committee and listened to what was going on,

1166
01:04:42.371 --> 01:04:45.970
it was supposedly listening to what was going on.
So I,
again,

1167
01:04:45.971 --> 01:04:48.820
I'm not saying that it probably won't,
but I'm not saying the fucking agencies.

1168
01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.320
Perfect.
And again,

1169
01:04:50.321 --> 01:04:53.260
I'm also not saying I can be objective about it and that would be,

1170
01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:55.510
I'd be lying if I said that I'm,
I am subjective.

1171
01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.800
I got a great deal of respect for him.

1172
01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:59.980
My experiences with them were extremely positive.

1173
01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:04.981
I saw people stand up with really sound moral compass and always try to do the

1174
01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:10.060
right thing.
Um,
so that's what I took away from it.
That's how I,

1175
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.720
I then processed all this other crap that's out there is noise.
So,
you know,

1176
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.970
if I'm wrong and I die and I find I'm wrong,
you know,
fuck me.

1177
01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:25.270
<v 0>I don't know what to say.
That's one way to look at it.</v>

1178
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:30.420
I can't imagine that it's possible to know everything that's going on in any

1179
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:34.330
organization.
I mean,
you can't,
no matter what it is,

1180
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.850
if it's a police department or if it's a,

1181
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:40.630
the CIA or the FBI or the United States army,

1182
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:44.320
every general doesn't know about every single action that every single soldier

1183
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:45.970
is involved in this.
It's impossible.

1184
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.520
<v 2>It's like going out to President Obama every time something goes wrong,
right?</v>

1185
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:53.850
I don't necessarily mean,
yeah,
it's,
it's convenient.
Um,
but no,
no president,

1186
01:05:53.851 --> 01:05:55.920
whether it's him or this President Bush,
or whether it's President Clinton,

1187
01:05:55.950 --> 01:06:00.560
whoever,
uh,
you can't know everything.
You gotta,
you gotta try,

1188
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.550
do your best to make sure you don't get surprised.

1189
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:05.490
And then for that you've got to rely on your,
on your staff.

1190
01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.200
And I don't think saying that you were surprised and,

1191
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:11.560
and you're just finding out about it.
It's a good strategy necessarily.
Uh,

1192
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.010
but at the same time,
you can't be expected to know everything.

1193
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.110
<v 0>Do you feel like that what's going on?</v>

1194
01:06:17.111 --> 01:06:20.470
Like the Wiki leaks thing and the artist formerly known as Bradley Manning,

1195
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:25.540
now Chelsea Manning,
Chelsea man,
you have to say Chelsea,
um,
her,
uh,
do you,

1196
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:28.540
do you feel like that's in the same league as Edward Snowden?

1197
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:31.510
Is one better in one worst because one was a soldier?

1198
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:36.180
<v 2>No,
you're,
you're,
that's a really,
it's a really good question.
Um,</v>

1199
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:43.280
I,
you know what?
Nobody ever accused me of being a deep thinker.
So my,

1200
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:47.540
my feeling about it is the commonality there is that you,

1201
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:52.680
you initially agreed to,
um,

1202
01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:54.080
keep your mouth shut,
keep your mouth shut,

1203
01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:59.081
to protect the information that you were given responsibility for having access

1204
01:06:59.901 --> 01:07:03.620
to and to do your,
your,
your,
your job.
Um,

1205
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:06.440
I think if you sign up to commitments,
if you make a promise,

1206
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:08.480
if you sign that promise,
that contract,

1207
01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:14.330
then you got to stick with it.
And,
uh,
and if you,

1208
01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:17.600
if you decide at some point that you can't because you're just so fucking

1209
01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.390
morally opposed to it,
then you know,

1210
01:07:20.391 --> 01:07:24.830
man up and find a way to do it properly.
Don't,
uh,
don't,

1211
01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:26.450
don't break the fucking law.

1212
01:07:26.451 --> 01:07:30.320
Don't go to the Soviets or the Russians call them the Soviet still.
Yeah.

1213
01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:32.990
I don't go to the Russians,
don't go to the Chinese,
don't,
you know,
don't go to,

1214
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.580
are those people who again,
don't have our interests in heart and uh,

1215
01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:41.430
and try to claim that you're doing it for the good of,
of all mankind.
You know,

1216
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:42.500
that doesn't make any sense.

1217
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.310
<v 0>What do you think they could do though?
I mean,</v>

1218
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:47.820
what does someone do if they feel like they're being ignored and they're on the

1219
01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:48.350
inside and they,

1220
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:52.050
they honestly feel like some horrible things are happening and they have no

1221
01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:52.180
worries

1222
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.300
<v 2>of course.
Well,
you know what,
it's,
it's,
uh,
if you,</v>

1223
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:59.630
if you believe in the justice system,
who knows what,
you know,
what am,

1224
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.860
I can't kids if they

1225
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.890
<v 0>yourself in this position at home,
he's a guy like Julian Assange's songs,</v>

1226
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:08.140
cause he's not even an American,
you know,
he's,

1227
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.620
he's locked up in jail and he's in an embassy supposedly for,

1228
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.010
yeah.
I thought it was coming out though the,
I thought it

1229
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.910
<v 2>was last I heard he was,
he was coming out to,
to face the charges of the,</v>

1230
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:24.290
of the sexual assault.
Well,
he started it.
He's not doing well health wise.

1231
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:27.920
It's not good.
Did Not have any sun for two fucking years.

1232
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:33.140
I've been at embassies.
I wouldn't want to spend two years in there.
Um,
but I,

1233
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:36.560
I think it's,
it's um,
you know what again,

1234
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:40.070
I easy I guess easy to say when you're not in that position,

1235
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:45.000
but at the same time,
um,
again,
it's just my opinion,
you know,

1236
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.560
don't,
don't fucking break your covenants,
don't break the law.
Um,
find a way to,

1237
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.500
to,
to,
to do it.
And if you can,
and if you can't just deal with us,

1238
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:57.660
deal with it.
Walk out and got to leave.
Go find yourself something else to do.

1239
01:08:57.661 --> 01:09:00.980
Okay.
Yourself a job that you can be happy with,
you know,
but you know,

1240
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.290
I'm sure there's people out there right now screaming,
oh my God,

1241
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:06.290
well you got to bring it up.
Well then fine level though.

1242
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:10.640
What level can the crimes be?
I mean,
what if you found out,
like,
let's get,

1243
01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.481
let's go deep.

1244
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.650
Like what if you found out that there was some sort of a false flag operation

1245
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.240
that was going to result in the death of a bunch of American lives,

1246
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:20.300
including American servicemen and cleaning American Pete,
you know,

1247
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:24.140
officers and enlisted folks.
I mean,

1248
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:27.230
if you found out something along those lines,
well that's a,
that's a,
that's a,

1249
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:29.520
that's a thriller movie concept.
But yeah,

1250
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.550
and there's never that ticking time bombs scenario.
I mean,
by the way,
that's,

1251
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.990
that was never a good defensive of sort of like a,
the interrogation program,

1252
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:37.820
that ticking time bomb,
you know,
that always saying,
well,

1253
01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:38.870
if I've got five seconds,

1254
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:42.250
so therefore I've got to hit this guy over the head with a car battery.
Um,

1255
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.760
but um,
you almost always have more than five seconds.
Um,

1256
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.220
but um,
but in that sort of a scenario,
I mean,

1257
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:52.960
that is a crime against the United States.
You,
yeah,
then fine,

1258
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.600
go out there and it's not as if,
you know,
again,
it's a hypothetical.

1259
01:09:56.601 --> 01:09:58.820
It doesn't make any sense in the sense,
in a sense that,
what am I gonna do?

1260
01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:01.460
I'm worried that I'm going to go and I'm going to tell my superiors and it's all

1261
01:10:01.461 --> 01:10:04.460
a cabal and they're all working together and the whole organization's gonna

1262
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:06.070
suddenly and now I'm the one who's going to be fucked.

1263
01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:08.420
And the next thing I know I'm being chased in the basement of the organization

1264
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:12.620
by all these people.
And it's a cabal.
No,
I mean,
you know,
if you find out that,

1265
01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:15.890
that there's something,
there's one thing to say,
I,
you know,

1266
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.600
I haven't seen any indication of,
of a,
of breaking the law,
but morally,

1267
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:25.010
I dunno,
this bothers me.
That's different.
If you find it,
you know,
then,
then,
okay,

1268
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.210
then that's one case you've got to deal with.

1269
01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.310
If you find a case where there's something he labelled one,
I'm willing,
fine,

1270
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.430
probably bring it to light immediately.
There's no other choice.
I mean,
it's like,

1271
01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:33.260
I used to tell them like,
guys,
you know,
you make a mistake,

1272
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:37.860
you do something wrong.
You tell me immediately and we'll,
and,
and you know,

1273
01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.940
that's the way that you resolve problems.
That's how you fix things.

1274
01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:42.200
That's how you make sure that,
that,

1275
01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:46.670
that things don't go off the rails and the agency does operate under that,
that,

1276
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.360
you know,
again,
people aren't going to buy it.
But,
you know,

1277
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.660
I saw time and time again,

1278
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.290
somebody would make a mistakes and we would make a bad decision and,

1279
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.730
and the first thing they would did was a march in there and tell them their

1280
01:10:55.731 --> 01:11:00.590
supervisors,
chief of station of whoever it was.
And you know,
there,
there's,

1281
01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:04.210
there's that type of culture in there.
Again,
people aren't gonna buy it.
I mean,

1282
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.150
cause that's the whole issue that the artist formerly known as Bradley Manning

1283
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:13.151
faced is that there was nothing that he could do or she could do now that was

1284
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.540
<v 0>being taken seriously.</v>

1285
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:19.800
So she went public with all that information because no one was listening.

1286
01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:23.910
<v 2>Well,
they have,
uh,
yeah,
they have,
uh,
Igg,
uh,</v>

1287
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.060
office jag office had a lot of avenues that they can go to that wouldn't be

1288
01:11:28.061 --> 01:11:32.520
walking into your immediate supervisor in the military.
Um,
because yeah,
sure,

1289
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.130
maybe that's not the best thing to do.
Maybe you're concerned.
It's all,
you know,

1290
01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.180
I,
I'm going to be punished for stepping out of line.
Well,

1291
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.410
they have practices in place that you go to just like in a corporate
corporation,

1292
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.310
got a compliance officer's,
you gotta,
you know,
Ombudsmen,

1293
01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.130
whatever you wanna call it.
So I had a,
I dunno,
I again,
I,
you know,

1294
01:11:51.131 --> 01:11:55.620
I'm not smart enough to,
to,
uh,
be able to address issues like that.
But,
um,

1295
01:11:55.990 --> 01:12:00.970
I do think if you make promises and you,
um,
you agree to,
uh,

1296
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.890
to protect and serve the interest of the United States,
um,

1297
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.570
don't break the fucking law.

1298
01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.150
<v 0>Don't break your oath.
That's,
you're right.</v>

1299
01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:13.720
Don't break your mouth that this is what you're dealing with when you're dealing

1300
01:12:13.721 --> 01:12:17.160
with any agency or the military.
You're dealing with,
uh,

1301
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:20.950
a group that you've agreed to be a part of.
It's a sacred oath that you've taken.

1302
01:12:20.951 --> 01:12:25.240
It's very important that you keep that oath and isn't what we're seeing with all

1303
01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:29.770
these leaks and all this different stuff.
Sort of a,
it's,
it's also,

1304
01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.650
it's an excellent example of the,

1305
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:35.980
the Times that we live in that is when you're dealing with something so

1306
01:12:35.981 --> 01:12:37.990
sensitive and so difficult,
it's very,

1307
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.170
it's very hard to get people to just keep their mouth shut now.

1308
01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.320
<v 2>Right?
And no,
that's it.
And they used to be able to hide these things.</v>

1309
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:47.000
That's a really good point.
A part of it is,
again,
part of his,

1310
01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.980
all the anonymous quotes in,
uh,
in,

1311
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.840
in the newspapers and oftentimes attributed to his senior military officials,

1312
01:12:52.841 --> 01:12:56.290
senior administration officials.
Part of it is the books that get written,

1313
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:57.690
you know,
the sort of the,
um,

1314
01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.750
the idea that I'm going to finish up as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1315
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:05.200
and I'm gonna write a book,
you know,
and that,
that filters down to the,
to the,
uh,

1316
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:07.400
you know,
the junior officers,
they see that other people in the,

1317
01:13:07.401 --> 01:13:09.940
in the organizations,
and they see that and they think,
well,
what the hell?
What's,

1318
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.440
what's sacred?
Then you know,

1319
01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.410
you're going to get out after 30 years and you get to talk about all the,

1320
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:14.981
you know,

1321
01:13:14.981 --> 01:13:19.600
the various things that were done in and give a mia culpa over a couple of

1322
01:13:19.601 --> 01:13:21.620
things and you're going to talk about shit that,
you know,

1323
01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:25.900
all that time you knew you weren't supposed to talk about.
So it's,
um,
yeah,

1324
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.300
I think there was a,
there's a,
there's a slide there in the,

1325
01:13:28.301 --> 01:13:31.690
in the sort of the cultural understanding of what is and isn't

1326
01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.053
acceptable.

1327
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.370
<v 0>So will you,
you're talking to about,</v>

1328
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:38.200
you keep saying the New York Times and you're talking about,
uh,

1329
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.450
unnamed quotes and unnamed sources.

1330
01:13:40.451 --> 01:13:45.190
You're talking about this James Rise in case where this guy is detailing a bosh

1331
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.180
CIA operation in Iran and they're trying to,
uh,

1332
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.770
trying to get his sources.

1333
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:55.210
<v 2>Well,
no,
it didn't,
not,
not just that you can't swing a dead cat,
um,</v>

1334
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.200
most days without hitting a major newspaper that's dealing with anonymous

1335
01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:59.550
sources.
I mean they just,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1336
01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:03.480
I'm just talking about in terms of all the general,
uh,
use of,
I mean,

1337
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.850
remember that I don't think you could in the past,

1338
01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:06.690
I don't think you could write a,
uh,

1339
01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.810
a major story if you had more than one anonymous source,

1340
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:11.980
maybe couldn't even have an source.
But now it's

1341
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.180
<v 3>just,
it's an accepted fact.</v>

1342
01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:18.610
And I guess the point being is that people just feel more comfortable speaking

1343
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:22.720
out of turn and that filters down to all the younger members of whatever

1344
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:25.600
organization it may be,
whether it's a company,
whether it's a hedge fund,

1345
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:28.060
whether it's a,
the agency at military,
whatever it may be.

1346
01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:31.590
<v 0>So you feel like in the case of this rising guy who's,
he's in deep shit,
right?</v>

1347
01:14:31.591 --> 01:14:34.140
I mean,
he's,
I mean,

1348
01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:39.030
the Supreme Court just rejected his appeal.
Um,
his refusal to,
uh,

1349
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.080
identify a source and what he's done is write a book based on some information

1350
01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:49.860
that allegedly someone from the CIA gave him,
the Supreme Court saying,
look,

1351
01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.420
you've got to give up that information.
You've got to say,

1352
01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:52.320
who told you this stuff?

1353
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.350
Because that's more important than the freedom of the press,

1354
01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.340
<v 3>right.
Protection of the,
of the source.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Again,
you know,</v>

1355
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:05.160
um,
I don't even know where to go with that.

1356
01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:05.641
That's like a,

1357
01:15:05.641 --> 01:15:08.190
that's like one of those meet the press sort of issues that no one's ever going

1358
01:15:08.191 --> 01:15:10.440
to call me on hold.
To play devil's advocate,

1359
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:12.920
<v 0>one way to look at it as,</v>

1360
01:15:12.921 --> 01:15:16.430
it's not like New York Times reporters had been infallible.

1361
01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.380
It's not like they haven't been accused of plagiarism.

1362
01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:20.330
It's not like they haven't bullshitted before.

1363
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.500
And if this guy wrote a book and the book was based on

1364
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.330
<v 3>unfactual</v>

1365
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:31.460
<v 0>or either lies or fabricated information,</v>

1366
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.510
it is possible.

1367
01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.280
Is it possible that you could meet behind closed doors and do that or it doesn't

1368
01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:38.270
have to go public?

1369
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.670
<v 3>Well,
you would think so.
Right?
I mean the judges,</v>

1370
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:45.750
it can't be the first time they'd need to find a mechanism for something like

1371
01:15:45.751 --> 01:15:48.990
this.
You know,
just like with,
with testimony up on the hill,
Capitol Hill,
I mean,

1372
01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:51.090
it's not,
it's never the first time any of that crap happens.

1373
01:15:51.091 --> 01:15:55.140
So they must have some sort of protocol in place,
you would think.
Um,

1374
01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.540
but perhaps there's a political element here to,
you know,

1375
01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.400
beating it out in public.
I don't know.

1376
01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:03.450
It is a very interesting situation when it comes to protecting sources.

1377
01:16:03.451 --> 01:16:07.800
It's like it's,
it would almost be if we had a lie detector tests,

1378
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:10.290
like an infallible lie detector test where you can say,

1379
01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:14.430
did these sources actually tell you this information where these sources really

1380
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.290
CIA deep undercover operatives where they legit people and you know,

1381
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.550
and then the guy,
it turns out he's lying.
Well then you throw the book at them.

1382
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:27.780
Yet if he's telling the truth,
then it seems like the onus is almost on the CIA.

1383
01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.360
Well,
yeah.
Um,
although I wouldn't put a lot of,
I mean,

1384
01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:35.160
yeah,
I mean not to get,
not to get in the weeds,
but yeah,

1385
01:16:35.161 --> 01:16:38.490
the polygraph is not necessarily,
it's,
it's a,
it's an art.
It's not a science.

1386
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.400
It's not ready yet.

1387
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.020
<v 0>This is sort of a battle between the idea of protecting sources and the idea of</v>

1388
01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:46.420
protecting America,
that these two things,

1389
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:51.690
maybe the oath that a person takes is equally important as the laws that are in

1390
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:53.200
place to protect sources.

1391
01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:56.590
And this is just duking it out to see which one holds precedent.

1392
01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:59.710
What's more significant in terms of the repercussions on the American?

1393
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.370
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I think I,
I could see where journalists would,</v>

1394
01:17:02.371 --> 01:17:05.160
would hold this up as an example of saying this is the same thing.

1395
01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:09.150
There's not that you can argue the difference.
Um,
is there,
um,

1396
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.190
is there a national

1397
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.840
<v 2>security element to this that takes precedence over a journalist,
right.</v>

1398
01:17:14.841 --> 01:17:18.080
To publish something and not disclose the source,
uh,
you know,

1399
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:20.930
that's a court decision.
And what were,
why,
I mean,
why not,
you know,
again,

1400
01:17:20.931 --> 01:17:22.190
no one's going to ask me for my opinion on that,

1401
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:25.850
but I can see where I can see where people could draw the comparison and try to

1402
01:17:25.851 --> 01:17:28.650
try to argue one side or the other.
Frankly.
Um,

1403
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.890
I think if there is a legitimate national security issue,

1404
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:35.570
you've got to weigh in on that side of it.
But that could also be abused.

1405
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.610
No doubt.
No doubt.
So you have to be careful about it.

1406
01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.340
<v 0>Yeah.
Isn't that the deal?
I mean,
that's the,</v>

1407
01:17:39.341 --> 01:17:42.010
the issue that we have with law enforcement and everything that you're dealing

1408
01:17:42.011 --> 01:17:45.490
with,
the human element.
You know,
I'm a big fan of law enforcement.

1409
01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:49.000
I took a lot of shit from people for saying that because whenever someone says

1410
01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:52.870
we shouldn't have cops who I'm like,
I know bad people.
I've met bad people.

1411
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:56.050
You're fucking crazy when people say that we shouldn't have military in your

1412
01:17:56.051 --> 01:17:59.350
utopian world and the world would be beautiful and charming and everybody be

1413
01:17:59.351 --> 01:18:03.360
grown flowers out of their ass.
Yeah,
that would be nice.
But that's not the world.

1414
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:05.530
Look at what's going on with Isis right now in Syria.

1415
01:18:05.531 --> 01:18:08.290
Anybody who doesn't think that you need military to deal with people like that,

1416
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.550
you're fucking crazy.

1417
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:12.540
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
I've spent a lot of time in,
in very,
uh,</v>

1418
01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:16.470
unusual in hostile environments where there is no rule of law.
There's no,
uh,

1419
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.930
and it's,
it's,
it's not a place people want to be.
Um,
and so I agree with it.

1420
01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:23.030
And that's,
and that's also part of the perspective

1421
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.930
<v 0>Yep.
That people think much a massive ignorance of human history,</v>

1422
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:30.400
human history and human motivations.
If you look at the potential,

1423
01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.100
and if you look at the possible future of humanity,

1424
01:18:33.101 --> 01:18:36.670
once we evolve past where we are now,
you have been a thousand years from now,

1425
01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:39.310
10,000 years,
holy,
a hundred,
maybe a decade.
Who knows?

1426
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:42.130
But the reality of right now,
if you look at the rest of the world,

1427
01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:45.090
look at what's going on with Israel and Gaza right now.
Anybody who thinks you,

1428
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:48.490
you shouldn't have some sort of method of protection,

1429
01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:53.140
some sort of method of inf intelligence information and the ability to operate

1430
01:18:53.141 --> 01:18:54.880
militarily,
they're crazy,
right?

1431
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:59.120
<v 2>Right.
And I don't know that human behavior is ever gonna Change.
I mean,</v>

1432
01:18:59.121 --> 01:19:00.460
technology adjusts and,

1433
01:19:00.461 --> 01:19:03.200
and so we ended up doing things differently because of technology and,

1434
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.360
and what that means to us.
But I don't know that,

1435
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.600
I don't think we're ever going to evolve beyond this.
We're all just a bunch of,

1436
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.220
<v 0>but don't you think we have from the time we were apes?</v>

1437
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:15.500
I mean we've kind of gotten a little bit better.
I know some guys that haven't,

1438
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.300
uh,
don't talk about it.
I'll sharpen that way,
man.
Oh.
Oh.
How dare you.
Oh,

1439
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.880
you walked me into that trap.
I just,
I feel like,
um,

1440
01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.280
this is probably,
at least in America,
this is fucked up as it is.

1441
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:33.180
This is probably the safest time ever for people.

1442
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.900
I really do believe that as far as violent crime,

1443
01:19:36.901 --> 01:19:40.320
as far as worried about being attacked by another country,

1444
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:42.120
I think it's probably the safest time ever.

1445
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.410
And I would hope that that trend would continue and that this would continue all

1446
01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:50.730
across the world and that human beings would slowly but surely sort out all

1447
01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:54.720
their bullshit and figure out a way to have a cohesive,
nice,

1448
01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.670
civilized world that we could all live.

1449
01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.980
<v 2>Not In our lifetime,
but,
um,
but it's nice to think about it.
It's just,
I,
I just,</v>

1450
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:01.814
I'm not,

1451
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.690
<v 0>it's a lot like evolution almost.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1452
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 2>I've seen some,
some,
some,
you know,
folks do some pretty,
you know,
uh,</v>

1453
01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:14.630
uh,
iffy things out there,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
So I think that,
um,

1454
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.840
I'm not as optimistic that,
that,
um,
that we,
you know,

1455
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:23.340
that human nature will change.
Um,
I think that it's possible,

1456
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.570
but I think that oftentimes we,
you know,

1457
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.180
I get asked this question all the time from a,

1458
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:32.220
from folks that are trying to manage security,
uh,
you know,

1459
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.370
work on crisis management,
that sort of thing for their companies,

1460
01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:38.460
for their families,
whatever it may be.
And um,
you know,

1461
01:20:38.461 --> 01:20:41.140
I'm not one of those preppers.
I'm not one of those people who think like that.

1462
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:43.410
It's all gonna fall apart and we're going to be dealing with zombies,

1463
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:48.020
although that,
that will be interesting.
Um,
that would be fun at all.
Yeah.

1464
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:50.340
It wouldn't be fun.
I mean,
unless you got a lot of gear,
you got to,

1465
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:54.450
you got to have a shitty life.
Is that,
oh,
I know.
I know as well.

1466
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.470
Yeah.
Well that's where we get that Idaho compound.
No,
I'm kidding.

1467
01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.180
Yeah.
You don't want the ones that move fast.
I never understood that.
Right.

1468
01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:05.760
The fast moving zombies doesn't make any 28 days later,

1469
01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:09.120
zombies are scary as fuck.
You know,
my,
uh,
my daughter was fantastic.

1470
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:12.570
She's in college,
she loves Zombie movies.
She refuses to watch 28 days to let it,

1471
01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.190
cause that freaks her out.
And so anyway,
uh,
but I,
I think that,
um,

1472
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:21.290
you know,
this idea that one of the biggest crisis we actually do face in the,

1473
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.340
in the short,
mid term is,
is to our power grid.

1474
01:21:24.341 --> 01:21:29.190
So as an example of what I mean by human nature,
um,
I lived in new Canaan,

1475
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:33.020
Connecticut,
so it's a,
it's a very nice little town in Fairfield county.
And,
uh,

1476
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.950
when I was working out of my New York office and one of the things I didn't know

1477
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:39.600
about new Canaan was if you buy a house there,

1478
01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:43.380
then you have to assume that in town you'll lose power at least every week

1479
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:47.760
during winter because everything's above lines above ground.
So one time,

1480
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:51.480
and after about a year there,
I didn't have any,
uh,
generators.
I'm not smart,

1481
01:21:51.481 --> 01:21:53.880
I'm not a handy guy.
And so my wife looks at me,
says,

1482
01:21:53.881 --> 01:21:56.040
are you ever going to go out and buy a generator for us?

1483
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:58.830
Because we're the only one on that block that doesn't have a generator.

1484
01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:01.800
So the power goes out for three or four days and then winter time it's pretty

1485
01:22:01.801 --> 01:22:04.110
damn cold.
First night.
It's fun,
right?
The kids are all,
you know,

1486
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:07.470
I got three boys and the scooter sluggo and Mugsy and they love a camp out.

1487
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:09.760
So first night's great,
second night it's,
it's,
you know,

1488
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.870
everybody's freezing the asshole.
So I,

1489
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.290
it took me the first winter to figure it out.

1490
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:16.680
I should go out and get a generator.
We had,
we had a power failure.

1491
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:21.710
So I went to a home depot and I went in there and I watched a fight break out

1492
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:27.480
and in a very affluent county of,
of,
of America,
uh,

1493
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:28.081
when the power,

1494
01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:30.840
it really only been out for probably about 36 hours at that point.

1495
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.480
And I watched a fight break out of a,
one of the last generators.

1496
01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:34.650
Apparently that was available.
I mean,

1497
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:38.070
I literally just walked up on this scene and there were people all mashed up and

1498
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:40.890
they'd been handing out numbers and trying to get everybody in order in line.

1499
01:22:40.891 --> 01:22:43.350
And I looked at this thing and I thought,
good God.

1500
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:46.560
So then I found the manager and gave him a hundred bucks and got the last

1501
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:51.090
generator.
So That's field expediency,
right?
Their kids.

1502
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:55.500
And it only cost 100 bucks on top of the other,
uh,

1503
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.210
on top of the cost of the thing.
So,
um,

1504
01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.480
and then I proceeded to show you how handy I am.

1505
01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:03.390
I proceeded to take it home and run the thing.
We had power.
It was fantastic.

1506
01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:06.100
I ran the generator and then I didn't realize necessarily that it needed oil.

1507
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:10.630
<v 3>So they blew the January,
I blew the generator.
And that was,
that was a,</v>

1508
01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:15.610
that was a happy day.
Um,
so my point being is that if the grid goes down,

1509
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:18.520
so we've only got three credits,
uh,
east western Texas,

1510
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:22.030
right around this whole country of ours.
And these grids were never designed.

1511
01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:24.700
They were never built to withstand a terrorist attack.
That wasn't the point.

1512
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:25.730
And now,
you know,

1513
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:28.960
the infrastructure is getting old and we're spending a lot of money trying to

1514
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:33.640
harden the facilities and trying to improve and provide more mobile generators.

1515
01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:36.190
It's a,
it's a major,
major issue in this country.

1516
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.090
And you could imagine if the grid goes out,
um,

1517
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.970
what we lose power for say two months,

1518
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.820
everything that drives transportation,
um,
trading,
banking,
um,

1519
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:52.120
just general wellbeing of,
of society,

1520
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:56.950
how we all feel about ourselves every day,
uh,
water.
Then we got a problem.

1521
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.020
And so my feelings always been,

1522
01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:02.020
I would like to think that we'll see the best of ourselves,
uh,

1523
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.770
during the course of something like that.
And maybe we will.
Um,
but I,

1524
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:06.610
I sometimes I,

1525
01:24:06.611 --> 01:24:09.040
sometimes I find myself being a little bit more cynical than that depends

1526
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:11.950
entirely on the desperation.
There's no food.

1527
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.440
You're not going to see the best in people.
No water.

1528
01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:16.810
You're not going to see the best in people for,
well,
you know,

1529
01:24:16.811 --> 01:24:19.420
people can bond together if they feel like there's a light at the end of the

1530
01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:22.760
tunnel.
The real problem was when there's no light,
when there's no light or,

1531
01:24:22.761 --> 01:24:25.180
or there's a brighter light over there than what you got,

1532
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:28.310
or they feel like they can get away with carbon,
their own light.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1533
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:32.240
At your expense.
That,
that is a real issue with human nature.

1534
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:36.520
Desperations scary thing.
Those prepper freak me the fuck out man.

1535
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.290
Because some of them,
it's like,

1536
01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:42.040
almost like they want it to go bad so that they could use all their canned food.

1537
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.700
You got to rotate that shit.
Just like you've got to rotate your ammunition.

1538
01:24:45.701 --> 01:24:47.140
You've got to rotate.
You can't food.

1539
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.250
So don't forget that when you're dealing with your two year supply.
Um,
but no,

1540
01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:55.450
I agree with it.
Anyway.
I know where I was going down that rabbit hole.
Well,

1541
01:24:55.451 --> 01:24:55.991
just talking about,

1542
01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:59.410
we were talking about zombies and your Idaho compound and sluggo and Mugsy

1543
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.460
really your kids' names.
Uh,
it basically,
yeah,
that's in the nicknames,

1544
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:07.370
but I don't think they know their real names at this point.
Uh,

1545
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.630
sluggo just started kindergarten,
uh,
the other day.
And,
uh,

1546
01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:16.060
that was exciting all the way around because he,
uh,
uh,
you know,
the,
the,

1547
01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:18.640
the oldest one,
like a lot of kids,
I don't actually have it.
Nevermind.

1548
01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:21.010
I don't want to get started talking about my kids and people are like tuning out

1549
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:22.330
right now.
He's talking about his kids.

1550
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.820
Well people like they don't mind talking to him cause,
but that's,

1551
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:27.760
it's an issue that everybody has.
It has children and you worry about the future.

1552
01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:31.650
You're worried about,
you know,
not just a future because of,
you know,

1553
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:35.200
bullshit that's going on overseas.
But just natural disasters,

1554
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:37.550
things that could happen that could wipe out the grid,
you know,

1555
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:42.580
asteroidal impacts,
etc. What I worry about too,
all those things,
I mean,

1556
01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:44.980
all the potential quite pant Damick you know,
even when whatever it is.

1557
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.500
But I tell you what,

1558
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.460
I spend more time away because I think it's actually more likely or possible is,

1559
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.223
um,

1560
01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:58.960
most of my time was spent overseas most of my young adult life.
And,

1561
01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:02.770
and you could travel to the darkest places out there,
that deepest,

1562
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:03.980
darkest places out there.
And you would

1563
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.120
<v 2>find somebody who would think,
you know,</v>

1564
01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:08.960
if I could just get to America then and I,
and I work hard and I can do,

1565
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:11.010
I can do better.
And they honestly believe that.

1566
01:26:11.011 --> 01:26:13.020
And people over here used to believe that.

1567
01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:15.410
I'm sure that a lot of people still do.
We've got great people.

1568
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:18.770
But I do worry about the erosion of that concept of,

1569
01:26:18.771 --> 01:26:23.450
of America being a place where we're VA,
we're very fortunate.
Um,

1570
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.650
and you know,
and I understand,
you know,
some more fortunate than,

1571
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:30.050
than a lot of others.
And I,
I,
you know,
that's obvious.

1572
01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:35.051
But as a country I worry more about the erosion of our belief in ourselves and

1573
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:40.060
our ability to do great things.
You know,

1574
01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:42.860
let me think about what we do with the space program for Fuck Sake.

1575
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:46.340
We put duct tape on a rocket ship and you know,
it took it to the moon and back.

1576
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:48.350
I mean,
we did shit and now we're,

1577
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.290
we're begging the Russians for a ride to the space station.

1578
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:52.610
And the Russians of saying,
fuck you.

1579
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:56.960
You know we don't like your stance on Ukraine so you can't go to space.
I Dunno.

1580
01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:57.913
I Dunno.

1581
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.100
<v 0>Digital is to cancel that.
The to this,</v>

1582
01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:03.180
when they canceled the space shuttle but they were keeping up the space station.

1583
01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:04.960
I was like,
Whoa,
what's that all about?
Yeah,

1584
01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.060
that sounds like the most ridiculous shit ever.
It's like,

1585
01:27:07.061 --> 01:27:09.310
we're going to have a house in the Hamptons but we're going to give away a car.

1586
01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:13.750
Do you have a house in the Hamptons?
No,
I don't.
I mean if you did,

1587
01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.220
I mean it's nice out there.
A lot of deer though.
You hit your car with him.

1588
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:22.660
A lot of there.
How the fuck do they expect to get out there?

1589
01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:26.920
Just seems to me to be so ridiculous that they stopped the space shuttle
program.

1590
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.220
<v 2>Well,
we want to live in a community of nations.
I mean maybe,</v>

1591
01:27:29.221 --> 01:27:31.380
I mean some people want to live in a community in nations and that's a lovely

1592
01:27:31.381 --> 01:27:34.100
idea.
Just like human nature is going to evolve and moral gonna you know,

1593
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:35.460
like you said at flowers at our ass.

1594
01:27:35.461 --> 01:27:39.540
I don't know what that gets us having flowers that are asked,
but it,
it,
uh,

1595
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.290
I think that,
you know,
there's,
uh,

1596
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:47.100
there's the reality,
which is that if you don't have somebody at the top,

1597
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:49.960
if you don't have a,
if you don't,
and during the Cold War,
you know,

1598
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.240
we had this bipolar situation with us and the Soviets and that worked all right.

1599
01:27:54.241 --> 01:27:57.580
As long as there was a balance of power,
physical balance of power.
Um,

1600
01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:59.730
but if you don't have somebody at the top of the food chain,

1601
01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:01.680
you're going to get kind of where we're going,

1602
01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:05.070
which is chaos and people looking to fill that void and we're not gonna be happy

1603
01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:06.660
with it.
And if you're not in charge,

1604
01:28:06.661 --> 01:28:09.890
then you're looking at somebody's ass in line.
Right.
And that,
you know,

1605
01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.840
if we're happy with that and we're happy with the ensuing,
you know,

1606
01:28:12.841 --> 01:28:16.290
potential chaos that that brings,
then fine.
Let's just admit it.

1607
01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.670
And let's say that's where we're going with all this.
You know,
we,
we,

1608
01:28:18.671 --> 01:28:20.160
we want to be average,
but I don't,

1609
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:23.280
I don't believe that's the case with this country.
And,
I dunno,

1610
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.070
<v 0>I know what you're saying.
You know,</v>

1611
01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.150
you're a patriotic guy and you're looking at the situation at hand and it's a,

1612
01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.300
it's very uncomfortable.

1613
01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:35.690
And I think that the reality of what's going on the foreign crisis is whether

1614
01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:38.340
it's what's going on in the Ukraine or what's happening right now.

1615
01:28:38.341 --> 01:28:43.341
And I racked this massive power vacuum is being filled by Isis and these

1616
01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:47.760
militant jihadists and somebody if somebody is going to be at the top better,

1617
01:28:47.761 --> 01:28:49.200
the United States the nicest.

1618
01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.700
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
And you know what honesty and that's,
and that's,</v>

1619
01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.980
I guess maybe that's what I'm trying to say,
but I'm not saying it very well,

1620
01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:56.720
is that I have a great,
uh,

1621
01:28:56.770 --> 01:29:00.190
deal of faith in the u s no matter which administration is in charge.
Again,

1622
01:29:00.191 --> 01:29:02.010
I don't like think I have a dog in the hunt.

1623
01:29:02.011 --> 01:29:04.470
As long as people are working hard and doing,
trying to do the right thing,

1624
01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:07.650
whether it's just administration,
previous administration,
whichever one,

1625
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.080
I got a lot of faith in the ability or the,

1626
01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:14.010
or the desire of this country to do the right thing.
Sometimes we don't do it.

1627
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:17.910
And it takes us a while to course correct,
sometimes longer than we should,

1628
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.320
but I do believe that we,
and that's something I took away from the time with,

1629
01:29:21.321 --> 01:29:24.750
with with the government.
We try to do the right thing.
So I don't know.

1630
01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.070
<v 0>I believe you.
I believe you and I think you're a noble guy.
I mean,</v>

1631
01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:31.570
when you're saying this to me,
I don't think you're bullshitting at all.
No,
no.

1632
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.420
What I worry most about when it comes to the United States,

1633
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.900
when it comes to the future,

1634
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:41.950
the direction of things is the influences that politicians have that are not in

1635
01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.610
the best interest of Americans.
That to me is one of the scariest things.

1636
01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.390
The influences of corporations that only look at things in terms of how much

1637
01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:54.830
money they can extract from x or y,
which one is going to be more profitable,

1638
01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.700
profitable for them.
Let's go with why we're going to make more money.

1639
01:29:58.701 --> 01:30:02.210
Fuck the American people and that politicians tend to lean towards that because

1640
01:30:02.211 --> 01:30:04.670
those are the very people that put them in office in the first place.

1641
01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.830
They're beholding to them once they get in there.

1642
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.700
That I think is one of the biggest threats.
The,

1643
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:14.770
the fear that people have of money over powering the greater good of the,

1644
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.050
the actual citizens of the United States.
Yeah.

1645
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.740
<v 2>I think you're,
I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1646
01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:21.900
And that's to that I would say what I always say,

1647
01:30:21.901 --> 01:30:24.930
which I've been beaten on his stupid drunk for a while is,
is term limits.

1648
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:28.650
I don't think we get big brave decisions in Washington anymore until we get term

1649
01:30:28.651 --> 01:30:31.080
limits to wait.
Take that,
that this the system,

1650
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:34.320
which quite frankly the founding fathers never imagined that anybody in their

1651
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:37.110
right mind would want to stay in Washington for 36 years,
you know,

1652
01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:40.660
who would want to do that in their mind.
So they didn't put that in there.
And,

1653
01:30:40.661 --> 01:30:44.280
and,
and,
and that's the one thing I think that would make a difference,
you know,

1654
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:46.920
give congressmen two,
four year terms,
give senators two,

1655
01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:50.520
six year terms and get the fuck out.
Right.
And,
and,
and rotate that.

1656
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:55.290
We got some great people in this country that could step up and be terrific

1657
01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:56.910
leaders if given the opportunity.

1658
01:30:56.910 --> 01:31:00.210
And if we didn't have to pay a couple hundred million dollars every time we

1659
01:31:00.211 --> 01:31:02.490
wanted to run a campaign.
So put finance limits,

1660
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:05.340
that actually means something in there.
And,
and bring that down.

1661
01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:07.580
If you can't get your point across in a congress,

1662
01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.760
Congressional or senate campaign for say you know $1 million,

1663
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:14.880
$2 million from an island,
then you're a fucking moron.
How can you,

1664
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:15.900
how can that not work?

1665
01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:18.270
And you and you can only run your campaign for a certain period of time.

1666
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:21.360
How difficult does that,
so I mean the states tried it,

1667
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:24.390
individual states tried to do that and then the supreme court shut it down and

1668
01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:26.500
said,
oh,
states can't determine the,
you know,
the,

1669
01:31:26.501 --> 01:31:30.480
the term limits for federal positions,
which to me,
I still don't quite get that.

1670
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.650
But I agree with you.

1671
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:35.970
But I think that one step we could be taking to try to get that influence of

1672
01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:40.380
money out of politics in a meaningful way is,
is term limits.

1673
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.120
Get some rotation in there.

1674
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:44.790
Get some fresh blood in there so that you don't have people sitting there and

1675
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:46.230
people and these guys will say,
well,
you gotta.

1676
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:49.290
It takes a long time to understand how Washington works.
Well,
you know,

1677
01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:50.580
maybe if you're a moron,

1678
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:54.090
but Washington's a pretty straightforward place at the end of the day and if you

1679
01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:56.610
can't figure it out the legislative process in six months,
you're an idiot.

1680
01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.330
You shouldn't be there.
So that's where I'm,
I'll,
I'll step off my soapbox now,

1681
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.050
<v 0>be circumvented the same way.</v>

1682
01:32:06.051 --> 01:32:09.290
They've kind of been with the president where they just have so much massive

1683
01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:11.390
money and influence that they essentially,

1684
01:32:11.391 --> 01:32:15.050
the two party system is controlled by virtually the same corporations in the

1685
01:32:15.051 --> 01:32:15.884
first,

1686
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:17.270
<v 2>well,
you know what,</v>

1687
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.150
I'm not saying that they wouldn't figure out a way to try to game the system at

1688
01:32:20.151 --> 01:32:21.440
some point,
but it'd be more difficult.

1689
01:32:21.441 --> 01:32:23.030
It would be much more difficult if suddenly,

1690
01:32:23.031 --> 01:32:26.450
if I'm a corporation and I know that somebody is going to be on the ways and

1691
01:32:26.451 --> 01:32:31.040
Means Committee for the next 24 years,
then I know what I'm going to do.

1692
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:33.960
I know how I'm going to try to influence that position in.
I'm to,
you know,

1693
01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.140
kind of work that,
that from a lobbying position,

1694
01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:41.420
if you're only there for two terms,
I got to change my game plan.

1695
01:32:41.421 --> 01:32:44.210
I'm not going to invest all my time and effort and resources into,

1696
01:32:44.211 --> 01:32:47.780
into this person.
I'm going to think of it that and,
and you know what it's worth.

1697
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:51.110
I guess my point is it's worth the try.
Is any system going to be perfect?
Well,

1698
01:32:51.111 --> 01:32:55.820
no,
of course not.
But the way that it's working right now,

1699
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:58.220
all I know is we've got a city full of dysfunctional people who are,

1700
01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:01.730
I mean the congressmen are trying to run for election basically constantly.

1701
01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:06.320
A two year term means you're constantly trying to raise money and that's not the

1702
01:33:06.321 --> 01:33:09.420
way it should be.
And that's most of their time to most,
most of the time

1703
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:14.680
<v 0>is fundraising.
Literally 80% of the time that anyone was running for congress,</v>

1704
01:33:14.681 --> 01:33:17.710
anyone who's running for Senate,
80% of the time you're trying to raise it.

1705
01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.950
<v 2>Right?
And,
and,
and,
and when you send good people there,</v>

1706
01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:21.900
then they get cooptive by the system.
And,

1707
01:33:21.901 --> 01:33:24.300
and I must be extremely frustrating for the people that go out there with good

1708
01:33:24.301 --> 01:33:27.570
intentions and then they realize,
I've got to spend all my time impressing,

1709
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:31.770
you know,
the,
uh,
the congressional leadership with my fundraising prowess.
Yeah.

1710
01:33:31.771 --> 01:33:35.550
It's pretty ridiculous.
The situation is without a doubt fucked up.

1711
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:40.980
I heard it here first.
Without a doubt.
Are you,

1712
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:44.490
<v 0>do you get a sense by paying attention to all this shit that's going on
overseas,</v>

1713
01:33:44.491 --> 01:33:48.660
whether it's what's happening in the Ukraine was heating up in North Korea,

1714
01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:51.060
what's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan?

1715
01:33:51.061 --> 01:33:55.650
Do you get a sense that things are kind of like more chaotic and more hectic now

1716
01:33:55.651 --> 01:33:56.760
than they've ever been before?

1717
01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:01.710
<v 2>Um,
I dunno about than they've ever been before.
Certainly in my recent memory.</v>

1718
01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:05.700
Yeah.
I don't mix.
I remember it used to be that we'd have the issue,
right?

1719
01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:07.410
It was the Balkans.
The Balkans were a mess.

1720
01:34:07.411 --> 01:34:12.020
They were a big stinking mess and it was very violent.
Um,

1721
01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:15.360
there was a little lovely period of time where Haiti was the only real big

1722
01:34:15.361 --> 01:34:16.560
concern.
Um,

1723
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:19.470
we had the cold war era and that was very comforting for a lot of people because

1724
01:34:19.471 --> 01:34:21.360
you knew who the enemy was and you knew what the,

1725
01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:25.150
how the game was played in a sense.
Um,
and,

1726
01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.230
but right now with the flash points that we've got,
we've got the,

1727
01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.900
I mean the Chinese are,
uh,

1728
01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.500
increasingly aggressive and in an effort to try to retake the Pacific,

1729
01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:37.170
which they've always been pissed off that we've really,
basically,

1730
01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:40.230
I've owned since World War II and the Russians,

1731
01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:45.500
the Middle East situation obviously.
Um,
yeah,
I,

1732
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.590
I'd say it's more chaotic now than it has been in recent memory.
I don't think,

1733
01:34:49.591 --> 01:34:51.270
I don't think that's a,
that's not a big statement

1734
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.290
<v 0>is that what happens is they'll just an ebb and flow when it comes to these sort</v>

1735
01:34:55.291 --> 01:34:59.480
of situations.
When,
when it comes to like what's going on in the world,

1736
01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:00.410
power struggles,

1737
01:35:00.411 --> 01:35:04.250
then the power struggles that resolved and then new resistance builds up.
I mean,

1738
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:06.560
is that in your experience how things go?

1739
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.940
<v 2>Well I think it,
you,
you minimize the chaos by being consistent.</v>

1740
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:15.530
And what am I mean by that?
Is,
is it,
you know,
and as foreign policy,

1741
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:19.180
as an example,
if you're foreign policy message is consistent and uh,

1742
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.450
and strong and clear and there's no misunderstanding by either your allies or

1743
01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.840
the people that,
uh,
that are against us,
uh,

1744
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:31.990
then you can minimize the chaos that exists if it's not consistent and there's

1745
01:35:32.301 --> 01:35:36.590
confusion over where we stand.
And I'm saying we,
because you know,
okay,
fine,

1746
01:35:36.591 --> 01:35:38.420
we're still at the top of the,
of the food heap.

1747
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:42.860
Whether people are comfortable with that or not,
I don't know.
But,
um,
so if,

1748
01:35:42.861 --> 01:35:44.750
if we're not consistent in that message,

1749
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.230
then there's confusion and that's where you start to get problems because you

1750
01:35:48.231 --> 01:35:49.880
started getting people probing at the perimeter,

1751
01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:52.850
trying to see what exactly is going on,
what they can get away with.

1752
01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:55.400
We start getting less leverage.
I mean,
you know,

1753
01:35:55.401 --> 01:35:57.830
we're getting situation in the Middle East now where countries are acting

1754
01:35:57.831 --> 01:36:00.040
completely without,
uh,
consulting,
uh,

1755
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.800
with the u s you wouldn't have had that 30 years ago.
You know,

1756
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:07.630
it just wouldn't happen like Egypt,
Egypt,
and I think,
uh,

1757
01:36:07.631 --> 01:36:10.280
in,
in what they consider to be their own best interest.
The Saudis,

1758
01:36:10.281 --> 01:36:12.030
the Saudis are enormously,
uh,

1759
01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:15.370
pissed off at us still over of what they view as,

1760
01:36:15.371 --> 01:36:19.040
as the current administration is failure to,
um,
you know,

1761
01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:23.420
work with them to try to resolve some issues out in the Middle East and they

1762
01:36:23.421 --> 01:36:27.100
feel as if we've sort of abdicated responsibility now whether we have or not,

1763
01:36:27.101 --> 01:36:28.280
whether it's the right thing to do or not.

1764
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:32.600
I'm just saying from a policy perspective,
um,
you know,

1765
01:36:32.601 --> 01:36:36.020
if what we want to do is be isolationists then be very clear about that.

1766
01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.680
Say this is all we're going to do.
These are our parameters.
That's it.

1767
01:36:39.681 --> 01:36:43.700
So everybody knows good,
all good with it,
fine,
get on with it.
But you know,

1768
01:36:43.701 --> 01:36:47.570
the mixed messages or the problem,
I mean,
that's,
you know,
I think that's,
uh,

1769
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.680
so being clear

1770
01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:53.870
<v 0>in,
in one way being patriotic and being an isolationist and isolationists and</v>

1771
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:57.810
another way it meddling and foreign governments sending out a,

1772
01:36:57.811 --> 01:37:00.510
B and part of their political process,
all that jazz.

1773
01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.720
<v 2>Well,
I think that,
yeah,
exactly.
I mean saying,
okay,</v>

1774
01:37:03.721 --> 01:37:07.440
we don't really want to be involved.
Here's a red line.
You're past the red line.

1775
01:37:07.441 --> 01:37:10.530
I'll keep fine.
We're going to do something else over here.
Um,
you know,

1776
01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:13.380
we're going to pivot to Asia and I don't mean to pick on the current

1777
01:37:13.381 --> 01:37:16.600
administration.
I got a lot of respect for some of the folks in there.
But,
um,

1778
01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.970
there's a,
you know,
there's,
there's a lack I think,

1779
01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:21.630
of consistency and there's certainly,

1780
01:37:21.631 --> 01:37:23.970
I think in the sense of how the Chinese are behaving,

1781
01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:24.900
how the Russians are behaving,

1782
01:37:24.901 --> 01:37:27.780
how there's certain countries in the Middle East are currently behaving.

1783
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.910
I think it's an indication that they don't necessarily believe we're engaged
and,

1784
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.820
and that either worrisome or delights them,
you know,

1785
01:37:35.821 --> 01:37:39.030
depending on what position they hold.
So,
you know,

1786
01:37:39.031 --> 01:37:43.270
and I don't think we have the luxury of,
of disengaging.
You know,
again,
I,
I,
my,

1787
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:46.540
my experience has been when there's a vacuum,
you know,
shit happens.
Well,

1788
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.200
that's what we're seeing right now in Iraq,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.

1789
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.990
<v 0>It's one of the scariest times ever for the folks who live there.</v>

1790
01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:56.640
And what we're seeing in terms of,
uh,
these jihadists extremists,

1791
01:37:56.641 --> 01:37:59.760
this is like,
this is as ramped up as we've ever seen it before.

1792
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.510
And this is a direct response to the power vacuum,
right?

1793
01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.190
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
And you know,
we can argue all day long.
Okay.
You know,</v>

1794
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.640
should we have gone in,
you know,
should we not have a,
okay,
fine,

1795
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:15.460
but the situation is that it's fucked up and we got to deal with this right now

1796
01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.850
whether the 2001 decision was correct or not,
it is what it is.
Exactly.

1797
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.990
And so now we've got to deal with it,

1798
01:38:20.991 --> 01:38:22.520
otherwise we're going to pay a big price for this.

1799
01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.970
This is the first time that they've gained this sort of territorial integrity

1800
01:38:25.971 --> 01:38:29.720
from an extremist point of view and they're consolidating territory there and

1801
01:38:29.721 --> 01:38:33.380
own the entire northern province in Syria and an additional the territory moving

1802
01:38:33.381 --> 01:38:37.360
east and up through Aleppo,
uh,
they're controlling a border posts,
uh,

1803
01:38:37.361 --> 01:38:41.150
on along the Golan Heights.
They controlling Botha porcelain Turkey.
Um,

1804
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:45.310
and they've moved obviously into Iraq there,
you know,

1805
01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.650
not very far away that could piss on bag that at this point and they're

1806
01:38:48.651 --> 01:38:52.850
consolidating that turf.
And that's a huge recruitment tool for them overseas,

1807
01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.740
which is why we're seeing their numbers,
you know,

1808
01:38:54.741 --> 01:38:59.330
kind of grow exponentially at this point is because they've got the turf of this

1809
01:38:59.331 --> 01:39:01.580
caliphate that they've been talking about for years and years.

1810
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:03.680
Finally they got this physical vision of this thing.

1811
01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:07.390
They've got the resources from over running the banks and the various,
you know,

1812
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:10.310
military bases in Syria and Iraq.
I mean,
good God,

1813
01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:14.810
they've gotten their hands on multiple divisions worth of gear.
And so it's,
it's,

1814
01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.330
we're going to have to deal with it and somebody has got to put boots on the

1815
01:39:17.331 --> 01:39:19.490
ground,
whether it's us or somebody else.

1816
01:39:19.491 --> 01:39:22.460
It'd be nice to see the Turks step up cause they got a lot to lose on this one.

1817
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:25.910
It'd be nice to see the Turk step up and,
and uh,
and get involved.

1818
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:28.130
But somebody's got to put boots on the ground,
cause airstrikes alone.

1819
01:39:28.131 --> 01:39:29.180
I'm not gonna cut it.

1820
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:32.830
<v 0>Is this one of those situations to where it's difficult to get people</v>

1821
01:39:32.831 --> 01:39:37.690
enthusiastic about engaging because of all the years of war that people

1822
01:39:37.691 --> 01:39:40.840
disagreed with Iraq and Afghanistan especially.

1823
01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:45.420
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
I mean,
this is a much more imminent threat.
Well it is,</v>

1824
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:47.580
but it's hard to explain that to people who are fatigued.

1825
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.920
And I understand that 100%.
I mean,
you know,

1826
01:39:49.921 --> 01:39:52.680
we're all tired of the freaking war on terror while tired of Iraq.

1827
01:39:52.681 --> 01:39:53.850
We're all tired of Afghanistan.

1828
01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:55.890
And I understand that nobody wants to deal with it,

1829
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:58.290
but just kind of want it to go away.
Isn't,

1830
01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.720
that's not a sound national security policy

1831
01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:05.200
<v 0>future.
I mean,
what,
what,
what,
what can be done to sort of mitigate all that?</v>

1832
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:09.750
<v 2>Well,
the problem is that we're now in a position,
I mean,</v>

1833
01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:11.370
if we're just talking about isis,

1834
01:40:11.371 --> 01:40:14.460
the Islamic state went out in a position where we've got some pretty strange

1835
01:40:14.461 --> 01:40:18.480
bedfellows.
Iran is engaged against them.
Obviously the Shiite regime,

1836
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:22.410
they've been putting boots on the ground in Iraq for some time now trying to

1837
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.950
prop up Mollica who's now gone,
uh,
Syria.
Bashar Assad has been,
you know,

1838
01:40:26.951 --> 01:40:31.520
authorizing airstrikes in there.
So in a sense,
if we go into Syria,
you know,
and,

1839
01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.180
and try to kick some ass with Isis,

1840
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.810
we're on the side of the Iranians and Assad and this White House is really,

1841
01:40:36.811 --> 01:40:39.480
really unlikely to want to be seen in,
in,

1842
01:40:39.481 --> 01:40:42.000
in the public eye as taking sides with a side.

1843
01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:45.690
So this is probably the most complex situation they've got going right now is

1844
01:40:45.691 --> 01:40:47.250
how to do this.
Um,

1845
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:52.320
and that's why I say they're the best way to go about it is to strong arm if

1846
01:40:52.321 --> 01:40:56.810
necessary.
Uh,
the Turks,
a Jordanian Saudis to the degree we can,

1847
01:40:56.811 --> 01:40:59.530
we don't have much leverage with the Saudis anymore.
Um,

1848
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.730
to try to get them on board,
get an allied force in there because we can do it.

1849
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.820
It's not like we can't,
you know,
uh,
defeat them.

1850
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:08.800
We just don't have a strategy for doing it right now.

1851
01:41:08.801 --> 01:41:10.510
We've got a strategy to contain them.

1852
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:12.750
<v 3>Yeah.
I'm not necessarily the biggest Obama Fan,</v>

1853
01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:16.740
but man has this fucking guy walked into a hornet's nest from the moment he got

1854
01:41:16.741 --> 01:41:20.900
into the White House.
I mean talk about a chaotic eight years right now.

1855
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:23.960
Absolutely.
And they walked in without really,
I think,
uh,

1856
01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:27.630
appreciating how bad it could be.
Obviously a,

1857
01:41:27.631 --> 01:41:32.631
and walking in also with not as much interest in the international scene as in

1858
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.330
doing some domestic changes.
Well,

1859
01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:39.000
I remember when he was debating McCain and he was talking about going into

1860
01:41:39.001 --> 01:41:43.380
Afghanistan and then we'll just go in and take care of things and came was like,

1861
01:41:43.381 --> 01:41:47.940
do you even fucking know what Afghanistan is?
Do you understand how it works?
Or,

1862
01:41:47.941 --> 01:41:51.690
I remember when Mccain said that that place is operated essentially the same way

1863
01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:56.730
since Alexander the Great.
Do you,
do you recognize that it's not,

1864
01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.000
you can't just go in there,
right.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's the definition.
It's,
it's a,

1865
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:04.440
it's like Libya Libya's hot mess right now by the way.
Nobody's focusing on live.

1866
01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:06.130
Exactly.
Yeah.
They've just,
the,
the,

1867
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:09.880
<v 2>the,
the uh,
the extremists have just taken over the airport in Tripoli.
The,</v>

1868
01:42:09.881 --> 01:42:12.490
basically they,
they,
they have taken over the country.

1869
01:42:12.491 --> 01:42:16.240
There's almost nothing related to sort of a pseudo federal government running

1870
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:18.130
Libya anymore.
It's a,
it's a disaster.

1871
01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:21.100
But we can only focus on one thing at a time apparently.
So,
you know,

1872
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.500
right now we're looking at Isis,
but I think,
uh,

1873
01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.410
you look at Afghanistan and that's a,
that's a perfect example.

1874
01:42:26.411 --> 01:42:27.700
We didn't need another case study.

1875
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:30.220
We've got a case study of what the Russians did.
We spend a lot of time,

1876
01:42:30.221 --> 01:42:32.440
I was in there when,
when we were trying to get the Soviets out,

1877
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.620
we spend a lot of time trying to push them out and they went through the same

1878
01:42:35.621 --> 01:42:37.060
process we did after five years.

1879
01:42:37.061 --> 01:42:38.860
They were just trying to get the fuck out of there.

1880
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:42.580
They already realized it was a failure situation to try.
And so what did they do?

1881
01:42:42.581 --> 01:42:44.440
They retreated to the urban centers.
That's what we did.

1882
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.560
They couldn't figure out how to get a government that would stay in place after

1883
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:52.000
they left.
Same problem.
We're having all this,
we know that they went through,

1884
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:56.540
um,
I had one of my first hires in diligence,
uh,

1885
01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.160
for all your information and security needs was a former,

1886
01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:04.540
a military intelligence officer and he's a former tank driver too,

1887
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:09.100
for the Russian military.
And,
uh,
he told me,
he grabbed me.
I remember it was,

1888
01:43:09.101 --> 01:43:13.410
we went into a,
into a Tora Bora.
And,
uh,
he said,
you know,

1889
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:17.080
don't stay.
You can't stay there.
So they're like cockroaches.

1890
01:43:17.081 --> 01:43:19.300
You step on them here,
they show up over there.
Don't stay.

1891
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:22.690
He was still carrying around shrapnel from the time the Soviet occupation of

1892
01:43:22.691 --> 01:43:23.410
Afghanistan.

1893
01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:27.970
We didn't need to go all the way back through history to understand how this was

1894
01:43:27.971 --> 01:43:31.960
not going to work.
And I hate to say this,
and it does not.
I'm not,

1895
01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:35.740
I'm not doing any disservice to the terrific men and women have served over

1896
01:43:35.741 --> 01:43:40.450
there,
lost their lives and wounded.
The Taliban have no place to go.

1897
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.210
It's like the Vietcong,
where do we think they're going to go?

1898
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:47.590
So once we're finished there,
when they take back over,

1899
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:52.730
we shouldn't be that surprised.
So I,
I'm not an optimistic yeah,

1900
01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:56.780
we did a brilliant tactical mission there,
but by the spring of 2002,

1901
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.910
we should have walked out the door so that if you do this again,

1902
01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:01.280
if you allow your place to be used to,
uh,

1903
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.870
reach out to the west to come back and kill more of you.
But W nation building,

1904
01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:09.920
I don't give a shit whether he raised their literacy rate by two or 3% or build

1905
01:44:09.921 --> 01:44:12.890
another road.
They don't know what we're trying to sell them,
never have.

1906
01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.910
So that's,
I'm very frustrated with it.
That Afghan policy is vary.

1907
01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:20.420
Enormously frustrating.
It seems incredibly frustrating.
But what could be done?

1908
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:24.440
Is there a way to handle it better?
I mean,
what,
what could be done?
Well,

1909
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:28.580
once again,
I mean,
when that category,
why you'd Kinda,
you know,
you broke it,

1910
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:31.490
you know,
we'll kind of guitars,
um,
you know,

1911
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:34.520
we can argue about the wisdom of what we did,
but you're right.
I mean,

1912
01:44:34.521 --> 01:44:39.140
now you've got to look at it from a practical point of view.
Um,
frankly,
uh,

1913
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:43.970
anything we do in Afghanistan,
it's sort of like a holding a enterprise,
right?

1914
01:44:43.971 --> 01:44:45.620
So as long as we stay there,

1915
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.800
we can maintain some semblance of not a shitstorm.

1916
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:56.630
Uh,
once we leave,
then it degenerated.
So I,
you know,

1917
01:44:56.631 --> 01:44:59.510
I think anything we do there is simply a containment action.

1918
01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:02.320
<v 0>So does it just become the United States of Afghanistan?</v>

1919
01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:07.210
We take over and just found it on the poppy seeds and the fucking minerals in

1920
01:45:07.211 --> 01:45:11.660
the Ma in the mountains.
This goes back to that,
to whole narcotics there.
Hold on.

1921
01:45:11.661 --> 01:45:13.360
It's,
it's important to look at,
I mean,

1922
01:45:13.361 --> 01:45:16.690
if you really do think about what the scenario is over there,

1923
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.850
90% of the world's opium comes from there.

1924
01:45:18.851 --> 01:45:22.360
And there's a massive amount of calcium and ion and the minerals in the

1925
01:45:22.361 --> 01:45:23.830
mountains.
Well,

1926
01:45:23.831 --> 01:45:28.831
what the fuck else can anybody do other than try to figure out one way to fund

1927
01:45:29.231 --> 01:45:30.064
staying there?

1928
01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.430
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's,
uh,</v>

1929
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:35.360
one of the most unsatisfying discussions you can ever have.
We,

1930
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:39.380
<v 0>well,
there's no good answer.
There's no good answer.
Leaving sock Stang sucks,</v>

1931
01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:40.160
right?
Both of them.

1932
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.460
<v 2>Right?
And,
and,
and again,
we're,</v>

1933
01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:45.240
we're having this discussion in public that we're a public is entirely,
yeah.

1934
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:47.440
Rightfully so fatigued with this whole thing.

1935
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:51.690
<v 0>Not just fatigue but ignorant.
Right.
You ignorant of it.
Yeah.</v>

1936
01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:54.830
I've read quite a bit about it,
but I guarantee you I'm ignorant.
I mean,

1937
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:55.611
if I was over there,

1938
01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:58.580
I'd probably have a better understanding if I was over there for a decade,

1939
01:45:58.581 --> 01:45:59.900
maybe I would scratch the surface.

1940
01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:04.900
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
that's true.
Yeah.
I see what you mean.
But it's,
um,
but yeah,
we've,
we're,</v>

1941
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:06.400
we've got a lot of flash points right now.

1942
01:46:06.401 --> 01:46:09.960
We've got a lot of big issues that are,
that are happening.
And,
um,
you know,

1943
01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:12.910
now we've got the midterm elections coming up,
so I don't think anything,

1944
01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.070
nothing big in a way it's going to happen in Washington.

1945
01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:19.390
<v 0>Do you think any of this could have been avoided by not going into Iraq and not</v>

1946
01:46:19.391 --> 01:46:22.780
going into Afghanistan?
Or was that kind of shit inevitable anyway?

1947
01:46:22.781 --> 01:46:26.910
Because it was all this with having a ruthless dictator,
like Saddam was saying,

1948
01:46:26.911 --> 01:46:27.760
that's no picnic.

1949
01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:32.350
Having a guy like that running a country of this evil fucking sociopathic serial

1950
01:46:32.351 --> 01:46:35.440
killer sons.
I mean that guy was a ruthless piece of shit.

1951
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:38.510
<v 2>No,
absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean people say,
wow,
we should've left them in place.
Well,</v>

1952
01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.860
you know what the mindset at the time and people have won.
Yeah.

1953
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.400
I have a hard time remembering going back to what it was like,
right after nine,

1954
01:46:43.401 --> 01:46:46.880
11,
people thought shit was going to happen every single fucking now.
Right.

1955
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:52.050
And you it got it got overrun with Neil.
Kahn says,
no doubt about that.

1956
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:54.890
They,
you know,
they had an agenda,
they had a plan that there,

1957
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:58.650
this is what they were going to do.
Um,
now there was also,
and I do know this,

1958
01:46:58.651 --> 01:47:02.160
there was also agreement from a lot of allies that this was a problem that had

1959
01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:05.280
to be dealt with.
So it wasn't just the u s saying,
we're going to Russian,

1960
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:05.790
you know,

1961
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:08.190
cause that's a conspiracy or we're going to go in there cause we would get their

1962
01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:12.380
oil really well.
Um,
there,

1963
01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:15.600
there were a lot of allies that we believe in that.
And unfortunately,

1964
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:17.410
and this goes to show you how you gotta,

1965
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.770
you gotta be very careful about your intelligence operations.

1966
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.240
A lot of it was based on just crap,
bullshit,
you know,
and,
and,
and,
but,

1967
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:28.110
but the time at the time,
the way that we thought and the,

1968
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:30.080
and the fear that existed and,

1969
01:47:30.081 --> 01:47:33.420
and the way that people will said whatever it takes to protect the homeland,

1970
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:36.120
even if that means going into a rock,
you know,

1971
01:47:36.121 --> 01:47:40.260
because that's going to be the next flashpoint.
Um,
so I'm not,

1972
01:47:40.261 --> 01:47:44.190
I'm not wanting to say you got a second guess decisions that happened in the

1973
01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:47.700
past because it's a complete waste of fucking breath.
But I mean,

1974
01:47:47.701 --> 01:47:50.610
I guess you could,
you obviously can learn things from it.
But,
um,

1975
01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.370
more to your point,
which is a much more important question,

1976
01:47:53.371 --> 01:47:54.600
is what do you do about it now?

1977
01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:58.900
<v 3>What,
what no one has a good solution.
No one has,</v>

1978
01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:02.860
no one is standing up on top of a soapbox saying,
this is what needs to be done.

1979
01:48:02.861 --> 01:48:06.050
If we do this,
we're going to have peace on earth.
Right?
And you're right,
the,

1980
01:48:06.090 --> 01:48:09.330
you know,
the Republicans are beating the Democrats over the head saying,
hey,

1981
01:48:09.331 --> 01:48:11.950
you got,
but the Republican side,
you know,
come up,
come up with a decision,

1982
01:48:12.010 --> 01:48:14.870
come up with an idea.
You know,
I mean,
I'm not,

1983
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:18.290
I'm not a fan again of Obama could change your fucking Sarah Palin was the God

1984
01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.900
damn vice president United States right now.

1985
01:48:20.230 --> 01:48:22.510
How the world would be looking at us.
Well that's why I say I,
you know,

1986
01:48:22.511 --> 01:48:25.600
another thing I think is,
I can go back to term limits and finance reform

1987
01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:27.340
<v 2>is I think we get a lot of,</v>

1988
01:48:27.490 --> 01:48:31.570
we get a deeper pool of potential candidates and we surprised ourselves with how

1989
01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:33.510
many really good,
smart,
uh,

1990
01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.570
dynamic people are out there who might be willing to step in if they didn't have

1991
01:48:37.571 --> 01:48:40.180
to go through this insane political process.
So,

1992
01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.650
<v 3>Eh,
yeah.
What do I know?
What do I,
I don't even know how we got on the subject.</v>

1993
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.320
It's,
it's a,
it's Wednesday evening.
Let's talk about your show,
man.

1994
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:53.030
It's used to be called America declassified.

1995
01:48:53.031 --> 01:48:54.100
And what are you guys going to call it now?

1996
01:48:54.130 --> 01:48:56.650
Now it's going to be called world access,
world access.

1997
01:48:56.651 --> 01:48:59.770
We're almost finished filming episodes.
We've been all over the country,

1998
01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:04.690
a great country,
seeing terrific sites,
talking to really cool people,
um,

1999
01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.340
exploring things,
doing shit,
chasing Burmese pythons in the everglades,

2000
01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:13.410
a roping in the,
in the glacial ice caves up in Alaska,
uh,

2001
01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.630
tracking grizzlies and beautiful Yellowstone park.

2002
01:49:16.690 --> 01:49:20.950
If people haven't been to Yellowstone.
Oh my God.
Incredible.
It's incredible.
And,

2003
01:49:20.951 --> 01:49:23.120
uh,
you got to,
you could do yourself a favor and kind of,
I tell,

2004
01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:26.500
don't kill everybody.
Get that before that happens.

2005
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:29.830
The world before the end of the world,
like you where it starts.
Yeah.

2006
01:49:29.831 --> 01:49:33.970
Idaho be blown off the map if that happens.
But um,
so we'll California,
yeah,
yeah,

2007
01:49:33.971 --> 01:49:38.380
exactly.
But wait,
so it's going to air in the late fall.
Uh,
will the access,
it's,

2008
01:49:38.381 --> 01:49:40.870
it's,
it's,
uh,
the production companies into go film

2009
01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.450
<v 2>is that a San Francisco and Los Angeles,</v>

2010
01:49:42.451 --> 01:49:46.510
a great bunch of people that's on the travel channel.
And uh,

2011
01:49:46.610 --> 01:49:48.280
that's all can think to say that's clever.

2012
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:51.810
<v 0>What was it like when you had investigate area 51?
Was that,
uh,</v>

2013
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.280
a Hornet's nest of looney tunes.
They can,

2014
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:57.560
that there's aliens that are pickled in a fucking mason jar somewhere down in

2015
01:49:57.561 --> 01:49:58.394
the basement.

2016
01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:01.450
<v 2>Yeah.
Well not the agency called me up and said,
look,</v>

2017
01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:05.590
here's what you can and you can't disclose a don't tell him about the sub

2018
01:50:05.591 --> 01:50:08.560
basement where we keep the Allianz.
Um,
and uh,

2019
01:50:08.561 --> 01:50:12.110
so I think I kept those secrets pretty well.
Uh,
it's area 51 is a,

2020
01:50:12.111 --> 01:50:15.100
is a fascinating,
fascinating place.
And um,

2021
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:20.300
it's what's interesting is tracking the history of sort of our developmental,
um,

2022
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.320
air platforms and looking at the timeline,

2023
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.780
the chronology of getting sidings and things and that,

2024
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:28.510
that to me is pretty cool because we were coming up with some pretty bizarre,

2025
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.860
you know,
air platforms for surveillance in particular and they,
shit,

2026
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:36.760
this shit was flying around the desert,
you know,
being tested.
Some of it works,

2027
01:50:36.761 --> 01:50:38.320
some of it didn't.
And you can imagine it,

2028
01:50:38.321 --> 01:50:40.240
you look at the timeline of people going,
oh my God,

2029
01:50:40.241 --> 01:50:41.074
what the Hell is something something?

2030
01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.890
And you see this happening and you understand why people were losing their
minds.

2031
01:50:44.891 --> 01:50:45.680
But,

2032
01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.070
<v 0>well,
it's,</v>

2033
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:49.550
it's people trying to believe their eyes are trying to understand what they're

2034
01:50:49.551 --> 01:50:53.120
seeing is a real issue.
We replayed a video yesterday on the podcast,

2035
01:50:53.121 --> 01:50:55.880
have a bear that's something wrong with its front paws.

2036
01:50:55.881 --> 01:50:59.090
It was walking on two feet and it looked like fucking big flood.
Oh yeah,

2037
01:50:59.091 --> 01:51:03.020
I saw the,
I saw,
that's ridiculous.
If you saw that,
you would think it's big foot.

2038
01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:07.070
When,
uh,
after September 11th,
we were filming a fear factor,

2039
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:10.700
a down near Edwards air force base.
Um,
we were,
uh,

2040
01:51:10.701 --> 01:51:14.510
out in the desert doing these stunts and a stealth fighters would fly overhead.

2041
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:17.930
And if you had never seen one of those before,
if you didn't know what that was,

2042
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:18.190
right,

2043
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:21.710
that looks like a Goddamn Ufo and now it looks like a spaceship from another

2044
01:51:21.711 --> 01:51:22.430
planet.

2045
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:27.430
This black thing that's not shaped like any normal plain and it's flying low and

2046
01:51:27.561 --> 01:51:29.960
fast.
You're like,
Holy Shit,
I'm looking at Dalian.

2047
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:32.500
<v 2>A lot of that technology developed at the agency,
uh,</v>

2048
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:34.210
by the science and technology group.
You know,

2049
01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:38.800
a lot of that early days in particular,
uh,
surveillance,
uh,
craft,

2050
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:40.000
incredible what they were doing it,

2051
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:44.540
<v 0>how does he recruit guys instead of like getting them a filter or like the top</v>

2052
01:51:44.541 --> 01:51:47.540
people instead of them going into the public sector and you know,

2053
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:49.130
making money doing something else.

2054
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.270
<v 2>That's good.
I mean,
you know what they got,
they got a huge number of applicants.</v>

2055
01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:55.920
I got,
I mean you,
you'd be amazed at how many people apply to it to work there.

2056
01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.250
Uh,
in,
in all cross the board operations,
intelligence group,
SNT,

2057
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.690
admin and logistics.

2058
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:06.340
They just get a very deep pool of candidates and you're right.

2059
01:52:06.341 --> 01:52:09.250
I mean these guys aren't looking to join for the money.

2060
01:52:09.251 --> 01:52:13.060
They can make a lot more money at Twitter or wherever.
Um,
yeah,

2061
01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:15.900
I just came to me,
I'm not that,

2062
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:21.430
not that plugged into my page or whatever.
You have a term page fellow.
Yeah,
I do.

2063
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:25.210
I do.
And,
and uh,
and I'm getting better at and understanding how you use it.

2064
01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:27.430
I've only got,
I've gone through like 800 tweets.

2065
01:52:27.431 --> 01:52:29.740
I'm always fascinated by how many tweets I've done because I think,
wow,

2066
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:33.540
how much time am I spending doing this?
Um,
but they,
you know,
they,

2067
01:52:33.541 --> 01:52:38.541
they get great people applying and part of it's just knowing that they're going

2068
01:52:39.731 --> 01:52:44.020
to be in the agency,
they're going to have access to,
uh,
both great people,

2069
01:52:44.021 --> 01:52:47.190
great technology,
sort of cutting edge thinking,
um,

2070
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:52.150
and as patriotism involved too.
I mean,
they want to work there.
So,
uh,
you know,

2071
01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:53.820
it's,
it's a,
I don't,
I can't,
I don't want to,

2072
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:55.670
I don't want to sound like a rose colored glasses on.

2073
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:57.860
It's a bureaucracy like a lot of other places,
you know,

2074
01:52:57.861 --> 01:53:01.730
things could be done better for sure.
Uh,
but you know,
my experience was always,

2075
01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.960
always terrific if any kids are out there listening,
I highly recommend you apply

2076
01:53:08.150 --> 01:53:11.840
now as far as like,
what's going on in area 51 today.

2077
01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.030
That's not the same thing.
Right.

2078
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:17.270
Like then they move their operations to a different area because so many people

2079
01:53:17.271 --> 01:53:20.570
are paying attention to it now.
Yeah.
They moved to woodland hills.

2080
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:28.210
Calabasas,
I'm getting bad.
This info.
Yeah,

2081
01:53:28.211 --> 01:53:31.870
I know they did move it because it took a little too much heat and so,
uh,

2082
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:35.570
so they,
they thought it might be better to have other,
uh,
facilities,

2083
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.920
but it's still true to this day is that they,
uh,

2084
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:42.050
inside the agency.
And I actually took a,

2085
01:53:42.051 --> 01:53:44.630
I actually took him to go films for this for the second season of,

2086
01:53:44.631 --> 01:53:45.890
of world access on travel.

2087
01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:49.280
I took them into the agency headquarters not too long ago,

2088
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:50.114
a couple of months ago,

2089
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:53.300
and we did a story inside the headquarters and part of it was based on,

2090
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:56.890
we've got a museum inside there that's open to the staff obviously and,
and,

2091
01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.280
and then a visiting,
you know,

2092
01:53:58.281 --> 01:54:03.281
liaison partners and dignitaries to come in and you look at the history and the

2093
01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.870
agency started out of oss,

2094
01:54:05.871 --> 01:54:08.380
out of the military and you look at the history of it in,
in,

2095
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:12.170
in all aspects of it,
operations,
science,
technology,
whatever it is.

2096
01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:16.220
And it's a,
it's a pretty incredible,
it's a pretty incredible place.

2097
01:54:16.221 --> 01:54:19.850
But they always,
when they're developing technology,
when the developing ideas,

2098
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:22.460
when the developing operations incident response to something,

2099
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:23.840
it's a response to a task.

2100
01:54:23.841 --> 01:54:27.200
They don't just sit around unlike maybe a tech company in Palo Alto or
something.

2101
01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:30.050
They don't just sit around and throw a ball at the wall and think,
you know,

2102
01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:31.280
let's come up with a clever idea.

2103
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.620
It's always in response to a task that they get from,
uh,

2104
01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.910
well from the administration says we need to solve this problem.
And,

2105
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.880
and typically the administrations over the years,

2106
01:54:40.881 --> 01:54:44.120
they go to the agency first because they know it's,
you know,
they'll,
they'll,

2107
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:45.920
they'll,
they'll cut through the crap.

2108
01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.240
They've got people who will sit down and come up with,
with,
with,
you know,

2109
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:52.470
scenario that,
you know,
this might work,
you know,
and it's,
and,

2110
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:57.050
and they work quickly.
Um,
and again,
they've got terrific creative people.

2111
01:54:57.051 --> 01:55:00.610
Listen to me on,
I'm a booster.
I believe you are a little bit,
I am a sister.

2112
01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:04.220
I have a book that's cause you're proud.
You're,
you're a real patriot.

2113
01:55:04.221 --> 01:55:08.660
I appreciate it that well,
it was good.
It did.
It did work.
I mean,

2114
01:55:08.661 --> 01:55:11.000
look at the stealth bomber,
look at all the shit that they did,
create it.

2115
01:55:11.001 --> 01:55:14.680
Look at the B 51 like all the different,
now I know a lot of shit they,

2116
01:55:14.681 --> 01:55:17.090
they created out of there.
That's pretty God damn amazing.

2117
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:21.440
And some of the most they've got,
they've just got a,
you look at some of the,

2118
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.670
some of the shit.
I mean,
anybody,
if this is a good point,

2119
01:55:23.671 --> 01:55:25.310
you're not going to get inside the agencies museum.

2120
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:27.840
Well you can if you watched the show in the fall,
but uh,

2121
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:31.130
they have a spy museum in Washington DC,
which is actually worth visiting.

2122
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:34.410
It's a really good,
it was,
it was.
Anybody can go to it.
Anybody can go to it.

2123
01:55:34.411 --> 01:55:38.880
It's in DC and it's a,
it's a,
it's a great time out.
Kids love it.
But the,
uh,

2124
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:42.210
but it operates on a couple levels.
One is sort of for the kids,
but one is,

2125
01:55:42.211 --> 01:55:44.340
is it's a really very,
very smartly

2126
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.450
<v 3>done a museum looking at espionage through the years trade craft and a variety</v>

2127
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:51.420
of operations that have happened over the years.
Fantastic facility.

2128
01:55:51.421 --> 01:55:53.830
So people should go to that one too.
Yeah.

2129
01:55:55.190 --> 01:55:57.870
Technology spying technology.
So fascinating.

2130
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:02.900
My Buddy Mike worked at the American embassy in Russia and they would find the

2131
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:07.530
surveillance devices that the Russians would install in these buildings that

2132
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:08.700
were so sophisticated.

2133
01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:13.701
He said they had found a listening device that was powered on the swaying of the

2134
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:16.110
building itself.

2135
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:19.680
The swaying and the movement of the building itself in the wind was actually

2136
01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:21.270
powering this device.

2137
01:56:21.271 --> 01:56:23.910
They said it was unlike anything that they had ever thought of before.

2138
01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:28.680
And it was just mind blowing that these equally intelligent people with a

2139
01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:32.340
completely different language in another country had come up with some

2140
01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:37.170
alternative path to,
uh,
to listen in on people.
Yeah.

2141
01:56:37.171 --> 01:56:41.730
The Russians Soviets during the Cold War in particular where we're,
you know,
a,

2142
01:56:41.731 --> 01:56:44.520
because they dumped unlimited resources into it and maybe because they were

2143
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:49.080
highly motivated and aggressive.
Um,
they were very,
very worthy.

2144
01:56:49.081 --> 01:56:53.850
Adversary is still are.
Um,
but yeah,
are,
are you cold war history,
um,

2145
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.670
is is a fascinating thing.
And you look at,

2146
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:59.290
you look at the technology that was developed out of that and,
and a,

2147
01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.120
and a lot of that ended up being used for the private sector and the development

2148
01:57:03.121 --> 01:57:07.000
of everything from smart phones to a internet applications.
So if variety thing,

2149
01:57:07.001 --> 01:57:09.660
so a lot of the crap that gets put together,
it gets,
uh,

2150
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:14.770
thought of and designed a inside the Intel community ends up benefiting the

2151
01:57:15.121 --> 01:57:18.120
private sector and the,
I just a person on the street,
you know,

2152
01:57:18.121 --> 01:57:20.340
commercial people is also fascinating too,

2153
01:57:20.341 --> 01:57:23.940
that both the Russians and the United States battled over who would get the best

2154
01:57:23.941 --> 01:57:25.600
Nazi scientists,
you know,

2155
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:29.790
dirty secret of the Cold War and of the space.

2156
01:57:29.791 --> 01:57:33.450
Race knew those minds.
I mean,
you've got to be,
sits pragmatic,
you know,

2157
01:57:33.490 --> 01:57:36.270
choices you've got to at time those choices.

2158
01:57:36.690 --> 01:57:39.370
It's a choice that nobody wanted to admit for the longest time.
Right.

2159
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.340
That Wernher von Braun was a Nazi.

2160
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:44.970
He was absolutely the Simon Wiesenthal Center said if he was alive today,

2161
01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:47.490
they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.

2162
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:51.390
And that's a pretty amazing thing to say when you consider the fact that that

2163
01:57:51.391 --> 01:57:53.860
guy was absolutely necessary to,
uh,

2164
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:58.540
take part in the space race and that the Soviets had Nazis,
we had Nazis.

2165
01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:03.570
You will make it pragmatic decisions in part because,
um,
you know,
I,

2166
01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:06.200
well part it was a,
well we lived in and um,

2167
01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:08.280
I don't know that you could do that today in terms of me.
I mean,

2168
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:12.270
look at the situation in Syria,
you know,
if we side with Assad,

2169
01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.680
is that politically acceptable here in the states politically turned down to do

2170
01:58:16.681 --> 01:58:16.980
that,

2171
01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:21.720
that these isis guys were super smart at social media and so we fucking hire him

2172
01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:25.050
to run the United States Facebook page and we'll go,
what the fuck?

2173
01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:29.580
You guys got these jihadis and there,
you know,
nobody would buy that today.
No,

2174
01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.230
I don't think so.
That's a tough sell.

2175
01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:35.490
What was it about the Nazis that made them so good at engineering and

2176
01:58:35.491 --> 01:58:36.510
technology?
I mean,

2177
01:58:36.511 --> 01:58:40.770
it is really incredible when you think about German engineering and technology

2178
01:58:40.771 --> 01:58:44.710
to this day is thought of as in the highest regard.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's true.

2179
01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:48.730
And it goes back,
obviously he goes back a long,
long time.
So,
um,
yeah,

2180
01:58:48.731 --> 01:58:52.060
obviously they took a left turn.
That's an a brilliant statement with the home.

2181
01:58:52.061 --> 01:58:56.180
That whole Nazi Shanana obviously.
Yeah,
obviously,
yeah.

2182
01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.130
Discounting their social activity.
Just the engineering and technology.

2183
01:59:00.170 --> 01:59:04.390
I'm always fascinated by what is it that causes one country,

2184
01:59:04.391 --> 01:59:08.860
one nation tick cell in a radical way above and beyond others.

2185
01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.610
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
it's good.
It's a good question.
Yeah.

2186
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:15.160
You look at some that just continued to keep,
you know,

2187
01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:16.750
kind of like ticking along at a certain level.

2188
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:19.300
They can't seem to raise the bar and it's,
it's tough.
I mean it's,

2189
01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.100
who knows what it is.
That's why,
again,

2190
01:59:21.101 --> 01:59:23.830
I go back to that same thing about the u s I think we can do anything.

2191
01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:27.250
Anything we put our minds to,
if we have,
if we have the collective will,
if we,

2192
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.480
if we set our minds to it.
And I just,
I hope we maintain that,

2193
01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:35.470
that belief structure for our kids.
I tell my kids that all the time.

2194
01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:37.660
I said how fortunate they are to be living in this country,

2195
01:59:37.661 --> 01:59:40.570
how fortunate they are to have the circumstances they have to,
I mean,

2196
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.720
not just putting food on the table,
but you know,
the opportunity for education,

2197
01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.180
all these things and to live in a place where you know,

2198
01:59:46.181 --> 01:59:50.320
hard work is valued and listened to me.
I said,
no,
but you're right.
No,
look,

2199
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:53.740
you listen.
Don't worry about it man.
You're a real patriot.

2200
01:59:54.130 --> 01:59:57.880
And I think that's admirable.
I think that,
uh,
for the longest time,
look,

2201
01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:59.890
I'm a car fan.
I'm a,
I love cars.

2202
01:59:59.891 --> 02:00:02.860
And for the longest time American cars were God damn embarrassing.
You know,

2203
02:00:02.861 --> 02:00:04.720
while German cars are producing these,

2204
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:08.200
they were producing these incredible Porsche's and the Italians are making these

2205
02:00:08.201 --> 02:00:09.050
fantastic Ferrari's.

2206
02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.580
We were making shitty mustangs and the fucking seventies pinto something

2207
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:16.210
ramblings.
Remember the Gremlin tasters and cars for a while,

2208
02:00:16.211 --> 02:00:18.490
and then something happened when the gas crisis came along.

2209
02:00:18.491 --> 02:00:22.960
We made shit for 20 years,
but finally now American cars are bounding back.

2210
02:00:22.961 --> 02:00:25.870
Like the new corvette is a marvel of engineering.

2211
02:00:25.871 --> 02:00:28.930
I mean all these European car magazines and saying it's one of the greatest cars

2212
02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:32.140
ever made.
Yeah,
I read.
So I read some comparisons on,
it's fantastic.
Incredible.

2213
02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:35.800
Yeah.
It's like,
it's great to finally see stuff like that happening.
It's like,

2214
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:38.060
why didn't it happen a long time ago?
It's a,

2215
02:00:38.061 --> 02:00:40.210
I'm absolutely fascinated by technology,

2216
02:00:40.211 --> 02:00:44.920
mostly because I'm a moron because I can't,
I can't engineer anything.
So,

2217
02:00:44.921 --> 02:00:49.480
and I see how someone figures out how to make a car where when you're taking a

2218
02:00:49.481 --> 02:00:50.170
turn,

2219
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:54.740
the computer adjust the shocks to put more pressure on one side to flat out the

2220
02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.760
fucking a man.
That's what I say.
I say if,
if,
if everybody was like me,

2221
02:00:57.761 --> 02:01:00.760
we'd still be trying to figure out how to make a wheel and how to build a fire

2222
02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:04.900
close.
If everybody was like me,
it'd be fucking stone rock tools.
That's it.

2223
02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:09.290
We'd make bang in Flint together,
probably doing a shitty job,
you know?

2224
02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.970
Yeah.
I,
you look at Shit that gets put together,

2225
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:16.420
the technology of it all and you think,
wow,
who,
who the hell came up with?

2226
02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:20.350
How did you think of,
how did you think of that?
But thank God they do that.

2227
02:01:20.351 --> 02:01:23.980
And then there's others,
you know,
who would get the job done in other ways.

2228
02:01:23.981 --> 02:01:26.140
But I buddy of mine,
I met his first car,

2229
02:01:26.141 --> 02:01:30.100
he'd pulled up in front of my parents house.
He was so proud.
I was,
I was young.

2230
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:34.660
He's so proud of it.
It was a Gremlin.
So proud of this classic rambler.

2231
02:01:34.710 --> 02:01:36.820
And I remember walking out there,
even at that young age where I just,

2232
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:41.360
I just gotten my,
my a learner's permit.
Even at that young age,

2233
02:01:41.361 --> 02:01:44.060
I knew he had just bought himself a piece of shit.
And I thought,

2234
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:46.910
how do I tell him that?
That was one of my first lessons in diplomacy.

2235
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:50.510
How do I look at this guy who was so proud of his fucking piece of shit and say,

2236
02:01:50.511 --> 02:01:53.680
yeah,
that's,
yes,
it's great there,
pal.
There's not much you can do.

2237
02:01:53.681 --> 02:01:56.030
You can't do anything.
Yeah.
Especially the guys first car.

2238
02:01:56.031 --> 02:02:00.920
My first car was at a fucking hunk of shit.
1973 Chevelle SS.
Nice.

2239
02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:05.270
It was nice for a day until the engine blew.
The first day I had it,

2240
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:09.680
or the second day,
one day,
the next day the engine seized up that had me,
I had a,

2241
02:02:09.681 --> 02:02:13.640
I had a,
I had a 77 Granada.
Ooh,
my first purchase,

2242
02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:17.210
1977 we're not Ford Granada.
It was very nice with it.

2243
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:19.310
Landau roof and a bench seats

2244
02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.230
and I remember the guy,
the guy said at the car dealership,
he said,

2245
02:02:24.231 --> 02:02:27.500
do you want it?
You want an eight track in that or do you want a cassette deck?

2246
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:31.460
Like cassette deck is new.
And I said,
what's a cassette deck?

2247
02:02:31.461 --> 02:02:33.050
And he showed it to me.
I remember it standing there.

2248
02:02:33.090 --> 02:02:35.840
He showed it to me and I said,
no,
I,
I'll take that a track.

2249
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.730
That's just not going anywhere.
It sounded better,
didn't it?
Supposedly.

2250
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:44.750
I thought they did.
But that was the knock on is an eight track.

2251
02:02:44.751 --> 02:02:47.690
Had a better sound.
It was just you had to deal with these fucking bricks,

2252
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:51.080
put it in there,
could chunk whatever it,
wherever it was in that tape.

2253
02:02:51.081 --> 02:02:53.360
That's where that song started to where it was.

2254
02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.520
And then you'd have a shoe box full of him cause that's the only way you could

2255
02:02:55.521 --> 02:02:59.360
store your eight tracks in your car.
Wasn't shoe boxes.
My family never had one.

2256
02:02:59.361 --> 02:03:02.690
But my friend Javier did and he,
his,
his mom had a,

2257
02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.880
she had an eight track of Pablo Cruz,
that song,
uh,
when my baby,

2258
02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:10.670
when my baby's miles at me,
I go to Rio.

2259
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:16.010
And I remember like seeing that thing in the car going,
I was incredible.

2260
02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:19.940
Sound is coming out of it whenever you want.
It's not even a radio.

2261
02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:21.770
What a coincidence.
I was in the agency,

2262
02:03:21.771 --> 02:03:26.771
I spent like eight months undercover in a Pablo Cruz cover band working over say

2263
02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.780
no,
I did.
I didn't.

2264
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.150
But it would have been good cover because nobody would,

2265
02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:36.850
so you had to start singing.
Yeah,
exactly.
Did you have to go into coverage?

2266
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:38.780
Did you ever have to do shit y'all?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2267
02:03:38.781 --> 02:03:41.420
I mean I spent all my time in operations and that's just what you did.

2268
02:03:41.421 --> 02:03:45.790
You worked in,
in whatever it might be,
their country.
Um,

2269
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:46.900
not really.
No.

2270
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.930
I've got a great relationship in part because I could you keep your my Yap shut.

2271
02:03:50.970 --> 02:03:53.750
Yeah.
But um,
yeah,
operations working in it.

2272
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:57.080
I will say this about operations and working on it covers if you like to act.

2273
02:03:57.081 --> 02:04:00.830
And I found that I did then it's,
it's great.
It's very,
I mean,

2274
02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:03.650
and we've got everything from our disguise teams inside the agency.

2275
02:04:03.650 --> 02:04:08.650
We've got some of the guys are Hollywood people out of Hollywood clamor to,

2276
02:04:09.661 --> 02:04:12.680
to get in there and work with the agency disguise unit because it's,
it's,

2277
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:15.520
so again,
it's so cutting edge and they how cutting edge,

2278
02:04:15.521 --> 02:04:17.150
do you ever have a guy dressed up like a check?

2279
02:04:18.230 --> 02:04:20.520
Like an old lady like me and my free time or

2280
02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:26.330
pretend to be a woman like big Momma's house?
No,
nothing like that.

2281
02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:28.250
Nothing like that.
No,

2282
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:32.750
but you don't have to be a fat lady would be a thin lady.

2283
02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.040
We had fat suits,
full overhead masks and,
and you had to,

2284
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:39.060
you had to be comfortable operating in,
in,
in,

2285
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.330
in pretty heavy disguise sometimes depending on where we were and where we were

2286
02:04:42.331 --> 02:04:44.970
operating at fat suits.
Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
Wow.

2287
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.540
I know it's not like fat best from Austin Powers,
but not quite that fast.

2288
02:04:48.541 --> 02:04:49.830
But I mean,
because what are you trying to do?

2289
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:51.240
You're trying to change your appearance quickly.

2290
02:04:51.241 --> 02:04:55.170
Trying to figure out ways to quickly but professionally and to withstand

2291
02:04:55.171 --> 02:04:59.280
scrutiny to change your parents.
People make snap judgments about people.

2292
02:04:59.470 --> 02:05:03.640
And in terms of surveillance,
people make quick decisions.
Okay,
I got,
I,
I'm,

2293
02:05:03.641 --> 02:05:08.550
I'm following this person,
uh,
brown shoes.
Um,
you blonde hair.
Good.
Got It.

2294
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.630
And you know,
and that's how they,
you know,

2295
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:12.540
surveillance teams will tee off of certain things.

2296
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:16.320
So if you can change your profile,
just,
you know,
in certain ways,

2297
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.150
then that's very beneficial.
But,

2298
02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.350
and then operating overseas and places where necessarily I might not blend in

2299
02:05:21.351 --> 02:05:23.420
unnecessarily.
So,
but if you,

2300
02:05:23.421 --> 02:05:25.740
if you like to act an operating on the cover was fantastic.

2301
02:05:25.741 --> 02:05:30.300
I happen to enjoy it a great deal.
About acting once you got out of the agency,

2302
02:05:30.301 --> 02:05:34.530
like uh,
acting,
acting?
No,
I would know.
I didn't even know how that would work,

2303
02:05:34.531 --> 02:05:38.670
but I mean a co hosting a show on travel channel world access is pretty good.

2304
02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:43.050
Why they change the world access and classified sounds like better for a former

2305
02:05:43.051 --> 02:05:45.240
CIA.
They wanted to lighten it up a little bit,

2306
02:05:45.241 --> 02:05:48.570
take it a little bit away from sort of the conspiracy and the dark side and

2307
02:05:48.571 --> 02:05:51.060
focus more on just going to great places around the country.

2308
02:05:51.061 --> 02:05:52.600
And hopefully that makes sense.

2309
02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:56.880
So world access and maybe next season for the next season we'll do actual world

2310
02:05:56.881 --> 02:06:00.000
access as opposed to us access.
But this show for Scifi,

2311
02:06:00.001 --> 02:06:03.510
I called Joe Rogan questions everything and they were trying to get me to do

2312
02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:07.950
sort of along the same lines of the Jesse Ventura show,
the conspiracy theory.

2313
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:10.950
They were really into conspiracy theories when I started doing the show.

2314
02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:15.270
But the more I started doing it,
the more I was like,
most of this is bullshit.

2315
02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:18.330
Like you're,
you're,
you're doing a show where you're exploring bullshit,

2316
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:21.270
but you don't necessarily want to call bullshit because you want to keep this

2317
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:25.980
air of mystery,
the change of people tuning in.
Right?
Yeah.
I,
I agree with you.
I,
I,

2318
02:06:25.981 --> 02:06:30.510
it can be very difficult to keep that up for any period of time.
Right.
And then,

2319
02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:33.720
and so I like to think,
I mean,
I,
I approached this,
this,
uh,

2320
02:06:33.721 --> 02:06:37.060
this second season's coming up,
this world access show it,
I approach it,

2321
02:06:37.061 --> 02:06:40.980
you of like anybody was sitting on a sofa.
You know,
I'm a fairly simple guy,

2322
02:06:40.981 --> 02:06:44.630
so when I go to some of these places,
literally I'm kind of staring there,

2323
02:06:44.631 --> 02:06:47.610
you know,
slack,
jawed and amazed at what I'm seeing,
whether it's the,

2324
02:06:47.611 --> 02:06:50.980
the geography or whether it's just dealing with the people at what goes on there

2325
02:06:50.981 --> 02:06:53.460
or whatever it may be.
So I like to think I'm,
I'm,
you know,

2326
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:57.000
I'm the guy that's sitting on the sofa watching this shit and I'm reacting the

2327
02:06:57.001 --> 02:06:58.740
same way they would.
I'm just fascinated by it.

2328
02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:02.970
So it's difficult to do sometimes with conspiracies because you feel like a lot

2329
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:03.570
of the conspiracies,

2330
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:06.480
they've been beaten to the ground and you're hearing stuff that you've heard

2331
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:08.430
before.
You're looking at shit that you looked up before.

2332
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:12.170
But not to say that it's not entertaining.
It is.
But anyway,
we'll see.

2333
02:07:12.171 --> 02:07:16.410
I mean even the science channel,
which is supposed to be about science,

2334
02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:21.450
they have so many of these God damn Ufo shows where they talk to these people

2335
02:07:21.451 --> 02:07:25.230
and they all have fucking stories.
But that's when it boils down to it.

2336
02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:27.100
That's all there is,
is stories,
right?

2337
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:32.180
Stories from questionable people and the stories are almost all goofy and you

2338
02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:35.640
just get,
it gets weary after a while.
You're like,
what kind of a show?
My making,

2339
02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:36.040
this is all

2340
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.870
<v 2>bullshit.
Yeah,
it's stories.
It's,
it's,
it's Ufo,
it's a ghost.</v>

2341
02:07:40.871 --> 02:07:45.560
Stories,
stories or eat and shit and going around to restaurants.
Uneaten food.

2342
02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:48.910
Right.
But you know,
Andrew Zimmerman,
like that kind of thing.
Yeah.
And,
and,

2343
02:07:48.911 --> 02:07:51.580
and you know,
I mean,
I can see why people find it interesting.

2344
02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:54.490
But what I like about this,
this,
this show now is,
is just,

2345
02:07:54.491 --> 02:07:56.230
we're going to some fantastic places.

2346
02:07:56.231 --> 02:07:58.330
We're seeing shit that you gotta make an effort to get to.

2347
02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:01.180
So everything that we're doing is basically got to work to get there.

2348
02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:03.310
But if you do,
it's well worth it.

2349
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:05.680
And it's not just sort of the same beat and path,
you know,

2350
02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:08.620
not walking up to the edge of the grand canyon staring out and going to Aa.
Okay,

2351
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:11.380
that's nice.
It's,
you know,
get outside your comfort zone,

2352
02:08:11.381 --> 02:08:13.030
travel a little bit more,
make the effort,

2353
02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.610
and you'll be amazed at what the country has to offer.

2354
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:15.821
<v 0>Oh,</v>

2355
02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:18.670
there's some incredible things in this country and people don't realize the fact

2356
02:08:18.671 --> 02:08:23.290
that out of these 50 states there,
I mean,
everybody thinks of New York,
Chicago,

2357
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:27.460
San Francisco,
you,
we,
we,
we think of these spots that you need to visit.

2358
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:30.580
But there's so many amazing spots.
There's so much shit to see.

2359
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:33.460
You could have a thousand episodes just traveling to different cities and

2360
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:34.294
checking out.

2361
02:08:34.590 --> 02:08:37.290
<v 2>Yeah.
Weird Shit that people do.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
No,</v>

2362
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.190
I just looked at my watch.
I realized if I don't leave now,

2363
02:08:39.191 --> 02:08:40.420
I may not make my flight.

2364
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.650
<v 0>Wait,
where's your flight?
What time's your flight?</v>

2365
02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.200
I don't even want to tell you if you don't want to tell me what time.
Well,

2366
02:08:45.210 --> 02:08:48.260
I probably probably,
I may not make it.
Okay.
I may not make it.
All right,

2367
02:08:48.261 --> 02:08:51.200
so should we wrap this out?
It's about 20 after four.
This my flow.
Okay.
Yeah,

2368
02:08:51.201 --> 02:08:55.550
you're fucked.
Yeah,
it's in Burbank.
Is it from Burbank?
It's not from Burbank.

2369
02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.510
Oh yeah.
Well you'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
We'll see what if you leave right now,

2370
02:08:59.511 --> 02:09:01.610
we'll,
we'll wrap it up right now.

2374
