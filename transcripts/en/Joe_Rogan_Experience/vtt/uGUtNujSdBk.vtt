<v Speaker 1>I always look at the fighters in the </v>

31
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never look at their feet.</v>

32
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying they're wrestling there </v>

<v Speaker 1>Their feet are up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't you know,</v>

37
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about.</v>

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>You often often talk about feet a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like feet touching me like </v>

39
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>digital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a man's foot touches me,</v>

40
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I have a fucking heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really would like to get their feet in</v>

41
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:46.011
<v Speaker 1>your face and you deal with and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweaty and their feet are sweaty.</v>

42
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Feet literally on your face all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Always have their feet on my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching.</v>

44
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the toenails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to that.</v>

45
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:59.361
<v Speaker 1>I was watching an old fight last night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were going for a heel hook and </v>

46
00:01:59.361 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I was getting grossed up just watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

47
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I touched his feet like I could never </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine like grabbing him saying like </v>

48
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>getting the fucking tate with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nail Polish and have a fucking.</v>

49
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you were going to fight in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>

50
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you'd want to wear socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

51
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:16.351
<v Speaker 1>like chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell at the legends you ever see </v>

52
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:16.351
<v Speaker 1>chocolate fucking 10th planet got combat</v>
<v Speaker 1>boots.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like chuck's a fucking dude like that.</v>

54
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.521
<v Speaker 1>I love all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why you wear socks but maybe </v>

55
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to get his feet funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mats at Legend sometimes people walk</v>

57
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love more the old place.</v>

58
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>The new place is actually separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's killed me with Jujitsu.</v>

59
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.631
<v Speaker 1>Was that they said over at the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people show up that at work </v>

60
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:43.461
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they had been working 12 hours </v>

<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu dog.</v>

62

<v Speaker 3>with a great sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's weird when everyone who </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is like,</v>

84
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it would be like kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up thing to do,</v>

85
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 3>but the people that do it are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly and cool and everyone's been </v>

86
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 3>tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's been through the ringer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>just you just go out there and do it.</v>

88
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it seems like it'd be like a</v>

89
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 3>douchey thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually very easy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's very fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

91
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

92
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you'd be sweating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>just do it,</v>

100
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 1>because it's hot as fuck in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dropped 80 pounds and it's affected</v>

101
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.151
<v Speaker 1>my stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means my ball sack at three sizes </v>

102
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day I stumble.</v>

103
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Your stomach somehow was sucking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball sack.</v>

104
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>That was taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pocket was taken the effect and </v>

105
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>sucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the effect of that ball sack.</v>

106
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:32.731
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at me to hear the explosion </v>

107
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:36.631
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to look at the fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look at the explosion.</v>

109
00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So ever since I lost the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stumbled by a Merino.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He would turn bright red with laughter </v>

264
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 1>because part of it was he thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny and part of it was shame.</v>

265
00:11:36.911 --> 00:11:40.240
<v Speaker 1>It was all mixed together with horror </v>

<v Speaker 1>take the blame for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do occasionally,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I inhaled that far.</v>

305
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 1>There's something very satisfying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>farting in a pool or a bathtub as well.</v>

312
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone walks up,</v>

313
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.090
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't plan it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought you were in the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a little came out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went to the doctor and the nurse </v>

318
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.880

<v Speaker 1>especially amongst comics that you're </v>

00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 4>but yet we just got done talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>farting on airplanes.</v>

345
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

346
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was going to say is what is about</v>

347
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:37.150
<v Speaker 4>like things like farts where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

348
00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:42.151
<v Speaker 4>if you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a cheap laugh and a lot of </v>

349
00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:42.151
<v Speaker 4>times it is a cheap laugh like bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>comics,</v>

350
00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:44.430
<v Speaker 4>but when it's telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.470
<v Speaker 4>when it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've talked about farts on stage </v>

352
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 4>before and had to be fucking crying </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

353
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 4>It's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anybody's smelled tate's Farts,</v>

354
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.480
<v Speaker 4>you will look at far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely different and it </v>

355
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:58.480
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be a hacky situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>

356
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.741
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's still one of those things </v>

357
00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:02.741
<v Speaker 4>where you think a lot of comics are </v>
<v Speaker 4>always worried about what other people,</v>

358
00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:04.760
<v Speaker 4>especially other comics think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>their material,</v>

359
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.530
<v Speaker 4>so they're scared to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

360
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's something they're really </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about.</v>

361
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:10.730
<v Speaker 4>If it's like a tired premise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to talk about it.</v>

362
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have your own unique point of view </v>

363
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:15.970
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't want to touch on it.</v>

364
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:15.970
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think that's good either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

365
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 4>I think you give,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you give yourself any restrictions,</v>

366
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can be dwelling on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dumbest fucking thing in the world,</v>

367
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 4>like the most obvious premise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're actually dwelling on it,</v>

368
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 4>you should even address the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is obviously a stupid premise.</v>

369
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Why am I fucking obsessed with this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

370
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 4>that's like when you start cutting out </v>
<v Speaker 4>subjects and like fucking,</v>

371
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many comics played the back of </v>

372
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.040
<v Speaker 4>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

373
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 4>How many comics do comedy instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for their own,</v>

374
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:45.491
<v Speaker 4>like their own personal viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do it so that other comics will </v>

375
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:45.491
<v Speaker 4>like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

376
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many guys remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember in the beginning open mic days,</v>

377
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:53.381
<v Speaker 4>there were dudes would only make comics </v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh and a lot of guys that got stuck </v>

378
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 4>in this weird spot where they all their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their audience was comics.</v>

379
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:58.350
<v Speaker 4>It would be good at making comics lap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but regular audience members,</v>

380
00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

381
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.020
<v Speaker 4>the comics wanted to see something </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

382
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>

383
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Joe Just kicked in and he sat back at </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

384
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Joey sits back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something.</v>

385
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Whatever Joey says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bag like this and crosses his fingers on</v>

386
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:16.270
<v Speaker 4>his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking gone.</v>

387
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:21.570
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on another planet right now with </v>

388
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:21.570
<v Speaker 4>the acupuncture and then got stone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we smoked that stuff.</v>

389
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.371
<v Speaker 4>You hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That put me right the fuck over the </v>

390
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:26.371
<v Speaker 4>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you worry?</v>

391
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever think about like what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about on stage or do you just,</v>

392
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 4>you just write out what you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

393
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Like do you ever look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

394
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.800
<v Speaker 4>maybe this isn't a subject for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I shouldn't touch this.</v>

395
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.670
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe three subjects that won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch on stage just because of personal </v>

396
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.830
<v Speaker 4>references and I'm a failure for not </v>
<v Speaker 4>touching them.</v>

397
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel like a failure for not touching</v>

398
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.330
<v Speaker 4>them because I'm letting my emotions get</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

399
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't like abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough.</v>

400
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like kids with AIDS and punching</v>

401
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of that either.</v>

402
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I've talked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've said shocking shit like that </v>

403
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.830
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was mean and funny,</v>

404
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.881
<v Speaker 4>but because it's a weakness to be able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go off and cover every spectrum of </v>

405
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

406
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.890
<v Speaker 4>But maybe you just don't find humor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't find humor.</v>

407
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk about a rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever.</v>

408
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I told you about fucking people they </v>
<v Speaker 4>asked that he has.</v>

409
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I've never mentioned the word rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rape makes my fucking neck hair stick up</v>

410
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

411
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

412
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Well then that's just you though is you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason.</v>

413
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

414
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking.</v>

415
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

416
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:34.890
<v Speaker 4>you talk about what you want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

417
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:39.891
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that shit on get it.</v>

418
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.150
<v Speaker 4>I put it on the truth about going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison,</v>

419
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 4>but I just cannot talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cooktop,</v>

420
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:47.660
<v Speaker 4>holding the guy down with a machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

421
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I totally understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

422
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 4>It's a tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tricky situation,</v>

423
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Does it?</v>

424
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what gets me about abortion?</v>

425
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Here's what gets me about the abortion </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>

426
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's two sides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

427
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 4>and there's one sign where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

428
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:07.251
<v Speaker 4>you're a pro life and you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people should be allowed to have </v>

429
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 4>abortions and that there's other options</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that it's killing it's murder.</v>

430
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.800
<v Speaker 4>And then the other side is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

431
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:14.050
<v Speaker 4>you support a woman's right to choose </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just a sick.</v>

432
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:19.130
<v Speaker 4>It's just a series of cells in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have a sole woman she's </v>

433
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 4>carrying in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be totally up to her.</v>

434
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't have to be just two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two points of view.</v>

435
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 4>I see both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

436
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 4>I should not be able to tell you what to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

437
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I should not be able to tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>what to do and I could totally see </v>

438
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:30.920
<v Speaker 4>wanting to have an abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

439
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 4>I could totally see not wanting to raise</v>
<v Speaker 4>a child at certain points in your life.</v>

440
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:37.191
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could totally see you having that </v>

441
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:37.191
<v Speaker 4>option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let's be honest,</v>

442
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is you're killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

443
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got each growing inside you,</v>

444
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Speaker 4>but it will eventually become a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

445
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

446
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can play games and say,</v>

447
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at three days,</v>

448
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:49.941
<v Speaker 4>and it's not at five days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is or whatever the fuck you want to </v>

449
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:52.431
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bottom line is there's a little </v>

450
00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:54.021
<v Speaker 4>human being growing inside your body and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should be able to do </v>

451
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:54.021
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck you want.</v>

452
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:54.021
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your body.</v>

453
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:55.430
<v Speaker 4>I really don't think anybody could tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

454
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

455
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 4>you're killing something mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're choosing not to let it grow.</v>

456
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.410
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're terminating it.</v>

457
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest about what you're doing.</v>

458
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:09.350
<v Speaker 4>It's a symbiotic relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the baby needs you to stay </v>

459
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.501
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a part of you until it becomes its </v>

460
00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 4>own individual entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the path has been set.</v>

461
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 4>It's on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

462
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how come you can't say that?</v>

463
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's either one or the other.</v>

464
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Either you support a woman's right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose or you know,</v>

465
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Speaker 4>you think it's murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one ever says,</v>

466
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I support the right for you to do it,</v>

467
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 4>but let's talk about what the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

468
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a creepy thing and if I was a </v>

469
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.231
<v Speaker 4>woman it would creep me out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would have to do something like </v>

470
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:33.231
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

471
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:33.231
<v Speaker 4>especially when you talk to someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's had kits,</v>

472
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.700
<v Speaker 4>once you've had kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand what,</v>

473
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 4>what babies really are and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

474
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

475
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 4>you get this experience of having your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own child,</v>

476
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>

477
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.660
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

478
00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 4>The abortions really crazy when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>

479
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I don't have the option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad</v>

480
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.870
<v Speaker 5>you know that I don't get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if it was you that got</v>

481
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.950
<v Speaker 5>pregnant if like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

482
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 5>like a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many abortions would you have?</v>

483
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have like 10 abortions.</v>

484
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you have your fucking plumbing break</v>

485
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.790
<v Speaker 5>a ceiling to this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>

486
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.950
<v Speaker 5>I went out with a girl once that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>sends so many abortions that she can't </v>

487
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.950
<v Speaker 5>get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

488
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 5>Say three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was so crazy.</v>

489
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

490
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.120
<v Speaker 5>I went to this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's had,</v>

491
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.130
<v Speaker 5>she's had like five or six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

492
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:19.140
<v Speaker 5>so she was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to this abortion or a show or </v>

493
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was at the Science Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it wasn't a show convention.</v>

494
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.390
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just a display that showed from </v>

495
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.460
<v Speaker 5>like every week of a baby's life that </v>
<v Speaker 5>meet thing,</v>

496
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:35.461
<v Speaker 5>that life thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bodies in motion and they're all in </v>

497
00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 5>glass jars though and there.</v>

498
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 5>And at first I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not real.</v>

499
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:42.901
<v Speaker 5>These are just little models.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you read down that these are </v>

500
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:42.901
<v Speaker 5>all real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start calling the mother.</v>

501
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you look at the very small one and </v>

502
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a little demon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know if you've ever seen it</v>

503
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 5>just looks like an alien or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lizard.</v>

504
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it just,</v>

505
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 5>it's so weird seeing a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you get to the big one and that</v>

506
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 5>is the most depressing thing you'll ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>see in your life.</v>

507
00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 5>Just as baby sitting there with a face </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's been frozen in time.</v>

508
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Like and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

509
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 5>it freaks me out and if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>the exhibit we're talking about,</v>

510
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:10.051
<v Speaker 5>it's a bodies exhibit and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>invented some new process of preserving </v>

511
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 5>human tissue and he does it somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another in plastic and they have a whole</v>

512
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Speaker 5>video on it.</v>

513
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.550
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called body worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm trying to think of the process </v>

514
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.151
<v Speaker 5>plasta something anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's really like a bunch of bodies </v>

515
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 5>all cut up in like in weird positions </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing weird things and you know,</v>

516
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:33.601
<v Speaker 5>it gives you a sense of the anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also gives you a sense like how </v>

517
00:22:33.601 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 5>is this any different than something a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking serial killer would do?</v>

518
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.970
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

519
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:41.810
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine that this was all </v>
<v Speaker 5>started by a guy who's just some sick </v>

520
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:46.351
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the way he pawned it off on people </v>

521
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 5>is like just checking out the anatomy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's some of them that are so</v>

522
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 5>questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

523
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.870
<v Speaker 5>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a chick cut in half at the </v>

524
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 5>vagina and the vagina and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>segments of her.</v>

525
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.620
<v Speaker 5>She's like cut in half at her fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>pussy.</v>

526
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 5>Like really tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really need to see that.</v>

527
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 5>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you sure about that?</v>

528
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 5>You sure you want to put that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>image?</v>

529
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 5>Pretty fucking demented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird,</v>

530
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like playing tennis and Shit and</v>

531
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:14.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just their muscle tissue with no </v>

532
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:14.791
<v Speaker 5>skin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fake eyeballs.</v>

533
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 5>It's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we go together to see?</v>

534
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 5>I think we did and we saw the imax movie</v>
<v Speaker 5>a body,</v>

535
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:23.250
<v Speaker 5>the body gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember being so stoned while seeing </v>

536
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:23.280
<v Speaker 5>that I almost had a panic attack and had</v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

537
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 5>We were so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had lollipops,</v>

538
00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:26.270
<v Speaker 5>didn't we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we had lost.</v>

539
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.870
<v Speaker 5>This was back in the days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rookie days of of edibles will.</v>

540
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.780
<v Speaker 5>We didn't quite understand what was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>

541
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.320
<v Speaker 5>They go to lollipops will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't know the people who don't </v>

542
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:37.330
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you eat pot man,</v>

543
00:23:37.331 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 5>you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get way different.</v>

544
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 5>It's a way different high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something called 11 hydroxy </v>

545
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 5>metabolites produced by your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about it before,</v>

546
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 5>but that's why people freak</v>

<v Speaker 4>out when the brownies and shit like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I always eat three peanut butter </v>

550
00:23:58.241 --> 00:23:58.710
<v Speaker 4>cookies and get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you call,</v>

<v Speaker 4>we will never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go like this dog.</v>

552
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

553
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got one.</v>

554
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.200
<v Speaker 4>No more fucking had apples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apples.</v>

555
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>

556
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bed had Tivo.</v>

557
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 4>So you feel like you could just record </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

558
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 4>The recording would be awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would be more awesome as the visual,</v>

559
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 4>you know to get some facetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Facetime.</v>

560
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 4>It's always doing facetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you eat those edibles and I </v>

561
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 4>them like eight in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys like I get up,</v>

562
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 4>have a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either fucking chocolate cake by 9:30.</v>

563
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.390
<v Speaker 4>I gotta go rewind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fear factor was all edibles because that</v>

564
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:43.391
<v Speaker 4>would last the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is also when I didn't </v>

565
00:24:43.391 --> 00:24:43.391
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just knew that I build up a tolerance.</v>

566
00:24:43.391 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 4>If I had a lollipop every day I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting blitz greed.</v>

567
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean like so baked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like freaking out about the colors</v>

568
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:55.391
<v Speaker 4>of the sky and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking how strange this life is and </v>

569
00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 4>we're pretending it's permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really temporary.</v>

570
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 4>While it was like forced to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not forced,</v>

571
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:03.941
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while my job was to do this fear factor </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

574
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

575
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 4>they do really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way stronger.</v>

576
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.730
<v Speaker 4>People don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's four times more psychoactive than </v>

577
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:15.730
<v Speaker 4>thc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you eat it,</v>

578
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.110
<v Speaker 4>that 11 hydroxy metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel like pod.</v>

579
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 4>Does it feel like you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like some totally different </v>

580
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 4>kind of a psychedelic trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

581
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 4>very introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

582
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 4>really makes you fucking consider your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

583
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're alone and you ate a Brownie,</v>

584
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.790
<v Speaker 4>you start going deep into your childhood</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Shit,</v>

585
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.660
<v Speaker 4>don't you thinking about like your </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with your parents and </v>

586
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.591
<v Speaker 4>fucking all sorts of weird shit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>made you become who you are and you </v>

587
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 4>start like really fucking going deep.</v>

588
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Last time I did edibles was that at UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>and oh,</v>

589
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.220
<v Speaker 1>it was with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

590
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it got to the point where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good match going on and everyone was </v>

591
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 1>murmuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.950
<v Speaker 1>at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an arena started that murmur </v>

593
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.490
<v Speaker 1>started to get in me and I start feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heart,</v>

594
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Ms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clay,</v>

595
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Guido Diego Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel the smacks was one flurry </v>

596
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.330
<v Speaker 1>of the first round where they were both </v>
<v Speaker 1>just look for like a minute,</v>

597
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 1>they must have connected on 20 punches a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

598
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I felt all 20 punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that I woke up like this,</v>

599
00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>like just holding onto myself like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even walk these fucking punches.</v>

600
00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:25.381
<v Speaker 1>That Diego's thrown at me and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden I realized I had Brian Redman </v>

601
00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:28.751
<v Speaker 1>next month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people like jake shields is over </v>

602
00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:28.751
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

603
00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:31.890
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I caught myself fucking blocking </v>

604
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Diego's body kicks the shit like twisted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

605
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

606
00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:37.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck three d glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in that bucket,</v>

607
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 1>when they broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

608
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.440
<v Speaker 1>that was a very intense first minute if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember.</v>

609
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what think about edibles.</v>

610
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 4>It swept you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just swept me.</v>

611
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm like turning and fucking fading and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

612
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 4>make it believe he was jabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>

613
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's real?</v>

614
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that the connection that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have when you get super high,</v>

615
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:02.121
<v Speaker 4>like especially with edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that weird feeling that you have where </v>

616
00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you can tell that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are lying,</v>

617
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 4>you can tell if people are upset with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and they're not talking about it.</v>

618
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 4>If you could tell if they have issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's real.</v>

619
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 100 percent,</v>

620
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real,</v>

621
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:14.661
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a different level of perception </v>

622
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:17.421
<v Speaker 4>that comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have a new sense that you </v>

623
00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:19.311
<v Speaker 4>usually don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you get sober you all of a </v>

624
00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:21.981
<v Speaker 4>sudden start thinking it's ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you sober up because you're not </v>

625
00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:21.981
<v Speaker 4>feeling the same sense and.</v>

626
00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:25.840
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean it's never more </v>

627
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.581
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no more ridiculous story than </v>

628
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:30.951
<v Speaker 4>you're telling someone that you have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightened perspective because you got </v>

629
00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:31.860
<v Speaker 4>intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will always make fun of that.</v>

630
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

631
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

632
00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.930
<v Speaker 4>You're high on mushrooms and you figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out the world.</v>

633
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Sure you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

634
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 4>because when you're sober it seems so </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous,</v>

635
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:44.030
<v Speaker 4>but when you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really high you can see some shit and </v>

636
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:48.141
<v Speaker 4>you figure out some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time you get high you get getting </v>

637
00:27:48.141 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 4>your car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's just go to starbucks,</v>

638
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.520
<v Speaker 4>you always figure out one component of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your day,</v>

639
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.790
<v Speaker 4>like one decision is made and it's made </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

640
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Speaker 4>and you stick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since that we'd every reason why people </v>

641
00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 4>think it makes you paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's making you think about shit.</v>

642
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 4>It's making you consider shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't ordinarily consider.</v>

643
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 4>And let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd in the isolation tank,</v>

644
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz,</v>

645
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 4>that fucking thing has changed my whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

646
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 4>It's rewired my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

647
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I have like all the hardware from my old</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

648
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 4>It's still like laying around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not even connected anymore.</v>

649
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 4>That fucking isolation tanks and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed.</v>

650
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:26.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to figure out how to live my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life as if like I just entered into this</v>

651
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:32.571
<v Speaker 4>world like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I entered into a body that's already </v>

652
00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:36.111
<v Speaker 4>existed and already had a history and </v>
<v Speaker 4>already had a bunch of things that it's </v>

653
00:28:36.111 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 4>already done and dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what have I done?</v>

654
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:37.530
<v Speaker 4>I've done all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

655
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:39.000
<v Speaker 4>What was I thinking when I did that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

656
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like become a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>

657
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Managing like a new life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what like the tank does to you.</v>

658
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 4>The tank is the fucking freakiest thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

659
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 4>I wish more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys would be into it.</v>

660
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 4>You know nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody does it.</v>

661
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:54.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why you guys wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

662
00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 4>It's I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always talk about it.</v>

663
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:59.580
<v Speaker 4>It is the craziest fucking experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I ever do.</v>

664
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like doing a crime and going home </v>
<v Speaker 4>and locking your door to smoking a joint</v>

665
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.920
<v Speaker 4>for eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sitting there thinking the cops are </v>

666
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:08.920
<v Speaker 4>going to break in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a horrible feeling.</v>

667
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 4>You get to see fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it is when you sit in that </v>

668
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 4>corner listening by the stairs to see if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come in.</v>

669
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.800
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucked up experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

670
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you clean your brain out of all the shit</v>

671
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:22.911
<v Speaker 4>that you've done that's making you worry</v>
<v Speaker 4>about people coming to get you all that </v>

672
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:22.911
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the shady shit,</v>

673
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:24.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you clean your brain out.</v>

674
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 4>How come you've never done the tank?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come you never go in?</v>

675
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fit.</v>

676

678
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.120

<v Speaker 4>It's not like you have to.</v>

679
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 4>There's two places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is soothing solutions in Burbank.</v>

680
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:44.480

00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Tape it and see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make a video.</v>

687
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 4>I feel when I'm taking you guys all </v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie to and already to.</v>

688
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Let's see how I was going to fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't start screaming.</v>

689
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.900
<v Speaker 4>He's faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

690
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.730
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't.</v>

691
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 4>If we just all said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

692
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.610
<v Speaker 4>let's all have an experience that we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>advertise that lady's business too and </v>

693
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:19.250
<v Speaker 4>the guy in Venice to let's advertise him</v>
<v Speaker 4>too because his place is share.</v>

694
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Is it really bad for labs to shit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy his.</v>

695
00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:27.111
<v Speaker 4>He's on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See everybody else's making these tanks </v>

696
00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:27.111
<v Speaker 4>like my old tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one I gave away,</v>

697
00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 4>which is excellent.</v>

698
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's better way better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

699
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

700
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:34.981
<v Speaker 4>It works good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his are like super thick steel and </v>

701
00:30:34.981 --> 00:30:39.001
<v Speaker 4>insulated and his like maintain </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature much better and it's much </v>

702
00:30:39.001 --> 00:30:43.110
<v Speaker 4>bigger so you have more oxygen inside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and he actually adds an oxygen </v>

703
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.110
<v Speaker 4>pumper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 4>an oxygen scrubber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it scrubs oxygen,</v>

705
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:46.750
<v Speaker 4>pure oxygen out of the air and pumps it </v>
<v Speaker 4>into you.</v>

706
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 4>He's just got it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

707
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.240
<v Speaker 4>he's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to float that Dotcom.</v>

708
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.470
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a cool.</v>

709
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.500
<v Speaker 4>The cool kind of crazy and it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad scientist and he's got this new </v>

710
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:58.500
<v Speaker 4>thing that I tell you about the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

711
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 4>the video cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This motherfucker,</v>

712
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:05.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you don't know about the </v>

713
00:31:05.611 --> 00:31:07.051
<v Speaker 4>isolation tank with the isolation tank </v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's a tank that was invented by a </v>

714
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:10.831
<v Speaker 4>guy named John Lilly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Lilly was this crazy psychedelic </v>

715
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:10.831
<v Speaker 4>pioneer from the sixties.</v>

716
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:15.570
<v Speaker 4>He used to take ketamine and and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>lay in the tank for days like he was </v>

717
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:20.041
<v Speaker 4>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to take acid and this is how I </v>

718
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:22.241
<v Speaker 4>figured out how to make the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He felt he wanted to figure out a way </v>

719
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.831
<v Speaker 4>where he was completely separate from </v>
<v Speaker 4>his senses so his brain doesn't have to </v>

720
00:31:25.831 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 4>listen to his body at all and he first </v>
<v Speaker 4>he started out with.</v>

721
00:31:27.821 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 4>He would be in a tank where he would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>upright and the the head you would float</v>

722
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 4>by the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so basically be hanging from your chin,</v>

723
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 4>which is probably not that comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get used to it and then you,</v>

724
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of you feels like you're </v>

725
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.251
<v Speaker 4>weightless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he figured out all you have to </v>

726
00:31:44.251 --> 00:31:44.251
<v Speaker 4>do is just put a ton of salt in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and that'll make your point.</v>

727
00:31:44.251 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Then you can lie on your back and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>like half of your body's exposed,</v>

728
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 4>so that's the new models.</v>

729
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:53.430
<v Speaker 4>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have like minus 800 pounds of </v>

730
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.161
<v Speaker 4>salt and 11 inches of water and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>lying in it and the water is 93 point </v>

731
00:31:56.161 --> 00:32:00.121
<v Speaker 4>five degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the same temperature as your </v>

732
00:32:00.121 --> 00:32:01.801
<v Speaker 4>skin and so as you lie in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel the water anymore and it </v>

733
00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:05.430
<v Speaker 4>you just dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have no body sensation at all and </v>

734
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.680
<v Speaker 4>it's just pure mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the mind with no connection to</v>

735
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any input,</v>

736
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.560
<v Speaker 4>so the mind doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>distractions.</v>

737
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 4>You mind gets to look at your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely objective.</v>

738
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:19.681
<v Speaker 4>We're not thinking about your back or </v>
<v Speaker 4>your fucking feet smell or you know </v>

739
00:32:19.681 --> 00:32:21.910
<v Speaker 4>you're touching the couch or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing the sounds and seeing lights.</v>

740
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 4>It's just pure mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that state,</v>

741
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the rarest states on </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

742
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 4>There's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's pretty simple to achieve,</v>

743
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:35.101
<v Speaker 4>but if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no place like that on earth </v>

744
00:32:35.101 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 4>where you couldn't be separate from your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

745
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Like literally you don't feel your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just your mind,</v>

746
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

747
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 4>and you get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all get distracted.</v>

748
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like having a conversation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of a giant crowd of people.</v>

749
00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:46.670
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're on stage that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>distracting,</v>

750
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:47.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to people,</v>

751
00:32:47.521 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 4>what people are next to you screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's distracting.</v>

752
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
<v Speaker 4>But what we don't realize is life is </v>
<v Speaker 4>distracting and sometimes you got too </v>

753
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.871
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why do people who have fucked up </v>

754
00:32:58.871 --> 00:32:58.871
<v Speaker 4>lives like to have a bunch of shit going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

755
00:32:58.871 --> 00:33:03.130
<v Speaker 4>You know how many dudes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that complicate their lives on purpose </v>

756
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.460
<v Speaker 4>because they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got some shit going on so they'll </v>

757
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:06.460
<v Speaker 4>just throw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting up a business like the fuck</v>

758
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.840
<v Speaker 4>are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're starting up a business man.</v>

759
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.470
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

760
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:10.800
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna start up a business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

761
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is he really starting up a business?</v>

762
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:17.501
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to distract himself with </v>
<v Speaker 4>more shit so he doesn't have to think </v>

763
00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:17.501
<v Speaker 4>about as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

764
00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:21.101
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a classic psychological ploy your </v>

765
00:33:21.101 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 4>whole life as a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even realize it.</v>

766
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Everything you do is constant input </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming in.</v>

767
00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 4>You've got to navigate your way through </v>
<v Speaker 4>this world.</v>

768
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 4>It takes away resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes away resources that your brain has</v>

769
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 4>got to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey d is,</v>

770
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.950
<v Speaker 4>let's go burbank next week to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>

771
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Lets me know if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have never done it</v>

772
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 6>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

773
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.510
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

774
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:42.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things.</v>

775
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 4>So if you ever been in the tub before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think you avoid that kind of like </v>

776
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.840
<v Speaker 4>heavy lifting when it comes to like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind?</v>

777
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.150
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

778
00:33:51.151 --> 00:33:52.380
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me I,</v>

779
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.730
<v Speaker 6>I have my own kind of relaxing things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I do and it seems like,</v>

780
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's not a necessities,</v>

781
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.580
<v Speaker 6>so I don't really need to blow money on </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that,</v>

782
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do</v>

783
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.460
<v Speaker 4>you have to kind of be a certificate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was free.</v>

784
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I would do it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's get you on it then.</v>

785
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.320
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be our next video.</v>

786
00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:16.530
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna do the isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to convert all you guys </v>

787
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.171
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's ridiculous that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been using this thing for seven </v>

788
00:34:19.171 --> 00:34:21.301
<v Speaker 4>years and you guys don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's better than a tanning bed </v>

789
00:34:21.301 --> 00:34:22.720
<v Speaker 4>and if you guys are way better jerk off </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you guys go to,</v>

790
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 4>if you google where to float,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just that term,</v>

791
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.720
<v Speaker 4>there will be a website that will pop </v>
<v Speaker 4>out from somebody,</v>

792
00:34:28.721 --> 00:34:33.721
<v Speaker 4>somebody.com</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are very awesome people that made </v>

793
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:36.811
<v Speaker 4>my first tank and their um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their website has a listing of places </v>

794
00:34:36.811 --> 00:34:38.590
<v Speaker 4>where you can rent time on a tank all </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the world,</v>

795
00:34:38.591 --> 00:34:40.990
<v Speaker 4>all different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different places it's available.</v>

796
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.380
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people have used it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>emailed me about it and said that they </v>

797
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:46.380
<v Speaker 4>found a tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

798
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:46.990
<v Speaker 4>like an hour away from their house or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

799
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.110
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking great tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great tool for the mind.</v>

800
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:55.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're the type of person that likes </v>

801
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:55.140
<v Speaker 4>to meditate and I think everyone should </v>
<v Speaker 4>know everyone.</v>

802
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:55.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you call it medical,</v>

803
00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you say meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sound like you're full of Shit and </v>

804
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you're doing yoga with beads on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

805
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.680
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like the word meditate has </v>
<v Speaker 4>this connotation is this,</v>

806
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fake,</v>

807
00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.860
<v Speaker 4>fake spirituality connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

808
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

809
00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.370
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but thinking about your life,</v>

810
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.280
<v Speaker 4>it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially in boulder,</v>

811
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 4>they use motherfuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lynn sand,</v>

812
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:22.050
<v Speaker 4>little words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was so many sand aware and muddle </v>

813
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:22.050
<v Speaker 4>falls in boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you what though,</v>

814
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.210
<v Speaker 4>they're nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would talk to people and you know,</v>

815
00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:25.990
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

816
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:27.270
<v Speaker 4>they would say,</v>

823
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 4>He's doing a lot of body work on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of energy work.</v>

824
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He talking about.</v>

827
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.480
<v Speaker 1>He was like totally straight face</v>

828
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 4>going to a healer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

829
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.940
<v Speaker 4>he's working on me doing a lot of body </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

830
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 4>He's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

831
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 4>he's doing bodywork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

832
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:54.801
<v Speaker 4>he's healing you rocks and saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that make a </v>

833
00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:54.801
<v Speaker 4>living doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

834
00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 4>They're healers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like push on parts of your head </v>

835
00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 4>and and claim that they healing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>

836
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you believe them,</v>

837
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.500
<v Speaker 4>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works.</v>

838
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the crazy thing is like the human</v>
<v Speaker 4>body is so fucking powerful,</v>

839
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:09.831
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know how to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a computer and we don't even </v>

840
00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:13.101
<v Speaker 4>have a manual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going into the registry and </v>

841
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:13.101
<v Speaker 4>fucking with things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really don't know how it works.</v>

842
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:16.100
<v Speaker 4>So you can trick somebody with a placebo</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the placebo,</v>

843
00:36:16.101 --> 00:36:17.430
<v Speaker 4>it's a sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just bullshit.</v>

844
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because they think it's medicine,</v>

845
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 4>their body fixes itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody knows how to fix themselves.</v>

846
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.130
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

847
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Speaker 4>could how come you can't?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The placebo method?</v>

848
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:30.270
<v Speaker 4>How come you can't just apply that on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own?</v>

849
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you just trick yourself?</v>

850
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 4>He can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you don't have access to that,</v>

851
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that pure belief.</v>

852
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 4>You don't have access to the pure </v>
<v Speaker 4>belief.</v>

853
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:43.071
<v Speaker 4>You have to be literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be kind of crazy to have </v>

854
00:36:43.071 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 4>access to the pure belief that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>fix yourself with this magic pill.</v>

855
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.370
<v Speaker 4>That's just sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking mess.</v>

856
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.420
<v Speaker 4>Why can't we use it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got like.</v>

857
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a hidden part of the operating</v>

858
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:53.130
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

859
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 4>you have to press like for keys at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time to get to it.</v>

860
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up,</v>

861
00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:57.750
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

862
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.970
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really cool to do stone.</v>

863
00:36:58.971 --> 00:37:03.971
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just thought of this while you were </v>

864
00:37:03.971 --> 00:37:03.971
<v Speaker 6>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to lose it,</v>

865
00:37:03.971 --> 00:37:06.640
<v Speaker 6>but I get really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really baked eats and go into your </v>

866
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 6>garage and get a ladder and if there's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>like one of those lights,</v>

867
00:37:08.121 --> 00:37:13.121
<v Speaker 6>like the garage lights go up through it </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a friend and he both look at each </v>

868
00:37:13.121 --> 00:37:14.660
<v Speaker 6>other's face or you turn off the lights </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he posts.</v>

869
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:19.661
<v Speaker 6>They're at each other's space and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you wait to your eyes adjust to the </v>

870
00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:22.181
<v Speaker 6>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you flip the light real quick and </v>

871
00:37:22.181 --> 00:37:22.700
<v Speaker 6>you see the other person's face like as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a ghost that's burned into your retina.</v>

872
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.540
<v Speaker 6>Then he'd come down from the ladder and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you just walk around and you'll just see</v>

873
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:28.880
<v Speaker 6>like this floating head in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long?</v>

874
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.770
<v Speaker 6>It probably lasts a good minute and </v>
<v Speaker 6>half,</v>

875
00:37:30.771 --> 00:37:33.020
<v Speaker 6>two minutes to work with black people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

876
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 1>no it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

877
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just see a community wall upstairs </v>

878
00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.750
<v Speaker 1>to put a light bulb on fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ladder.</v>

879
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.610
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I break my ankle as Casper?</v>

880
00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:47.510
<v Speaker 1>The friendly ghost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put Angel Wings on when I call high.</v>

881
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.620
<v Speaker 1>That's too much drama to get high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

882
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.510
<v Speaker 6>Thing that you've never experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Try it out.</v>

883
00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:54.500
<v Speaker 6>Why you scared?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

884

<v Speaker 6>Float tape.</v>

885
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 4>You know what is cool as fuck when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're high.</v>

886
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.140
<v Speaker 4>The La um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>planetarium or the Griffith Observatory.</v>

887
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that awesome?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you lie back and he watched </v>

888
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.240
<v Speaker 4>that star show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing fucking incredible man.</v>

889
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I went to Hawaii and we went to the</v>

890
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:17.710
<v Speaker 4>big island and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went up to the Keck observatory.</v>

891
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 4>So in the top of the big island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this gigantic fucking thing they </v>

892
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.370
<v Speaker 4>have up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No telescope.</v>

893
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the world's biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio telescopes.</v>

894
00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 4>The fucking view up there is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go up there every fucking star you </v>

895
00:38:33.491 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 4>see the whole Milky Way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you literally see the</v>

00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it's way to fuck up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 10,000</v>

899
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 5>feet above sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're literally above the clouds.</v>

900
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 5>You drive through the clouds to get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because we were driving.</v>

901
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this sucks man.</v>

902
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking cloudy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get up there.</v>

903
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:55.171
<v Speaker 5>We're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be able to see shit and all of a sudden </v>

904
00:38:55.171 --> 00:38:55.171
<v Speaker 5>you pop up above the clouds and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the observatory is.</v>

905
00:38:55.171 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 5>God Damn Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fucking stars are insane.</v>

906
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:04.261
<v Speaker 5>It's the best thing you could look at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the best view and we deprive </v>

907
00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 5>ourselves from it because the lights </v>
<v Speaker 5>even in la,</v>

908

<v Speaker 5>even in La,</v>

909
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 5>if they shut off all the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they shut off,</v>

910
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 5>everything above you would be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacular.</v>

911
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the most amazing thing.</v>

912
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Like I stood there and Hawaii looking up</v>
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

913

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.540
<v Speaker 5>This is there all the time and we can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>see it.</v>

915
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:27.541
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have all these stupid gay holidays </v>

916
00:39:27.541 --> 00:39:27.541

<v Speaker 5>they.</v>

917
00:39:27.541 --> 00:39:31.481
<v Speaker 5>Why don't they have a holiday where </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody has to turn off their lights </v>

918
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 5>and there's no electricity for the day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have it black out some knuckles.</v>

919
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.350
<v Speaker 5>How awesome would that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the greatest idea you've ever </v>

920
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 5>come up with in your fucking life right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

921
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.040
<v Speaker 5>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we had everybody doing it,</v>

922
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 5>literally there'd be nothing from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horizon.</v>

923
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:45.870
<v Speaker 5>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

924
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 5>how amazing would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The earth would reset.</v>

925
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

926
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.480
<v Speaker 5>that's what I wanted to go to Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you drive and you're going to the </v>

927
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 5>mountains of Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have beautiful views in Vegas,</v>

928
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.420
<v Speaker 5>but because of electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the God damn light,</v>

929
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 5>those lights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see a goddamn thing.</v>

930
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 5>You look up in the Vegas night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see a fucking thing.</v>

931
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 5>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine 20 years from now,</v>

932
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Vegas had to shut the lights from Sunday</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Thursday.</v>

933
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.930
<v Speaker 5>You would think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember when the Luxor had that </v>

934
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:12.930
<v Speaker 5>light that shot up in the sky and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>it up in the highlands.</v>

935
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 5>Crazy was so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was fucking with pilots.</v>

936
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.120

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

941
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:32.730
<v Speaker 5>it shouldn't be so easy to buy a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>laser that you can shoot up to the sky,</v>

942
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.110

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that parking lot area was like a Lego </v>

991
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:26.740
<v Speaker 4>club that we would go to.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like literally half the show </v>

<v Speaker 4>was the parking lot show you put on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>best shows first in the parking lot and </v>

994
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.910
<v Speaker 4>then you started putting on your best </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows on stage stage.</v>

995

<v Speaker 4>He used to fuck around a lot and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parking you became.</v>

997
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:48.010
<v Speaker 4>you got loose in that parking lot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>started fucking around with us and you </v>

998
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 4>don't have any restrictions about time </v>
<v Speaker 4>or agents watching you or managers.</v>

999
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:56.470
<v Speaker 4>You could just be yourself and you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking kill everybody in the parking </v>

1000
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:59.441
<v Speaker 4>lot and then he would take that and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>go on stage or that stage with the </v>

1001
00:42:59.441 --> 00:42:59.441
<v Speaker 4>angle.</v>

1002
00:42:59.441 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 4>But before you were telling jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1003
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 4>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you first started out,</v>

1004
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 4>you would like telling jokes on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1005
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.780
<v Speaker 4>Like how would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you look like?</v>

1006
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 4>What was like a typical routine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea.</v>

1007
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 4>You remember what you talked about at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all?</v>

1008
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:16.270
<v Speaker 4>That was a long fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like you would go into a subject </v>

1009
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.270
<v Speaker 4>but you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't really go into it.</v>

1010
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.640
<v Speaker 4>You will get the scratch it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would go to the next subject.</v>

1011
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:21.910
<v Speaker 4>That's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't,</v>

1012
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 4>you never figured out how to get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum.</v>

1013
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get the momentum from going into a </v>

1014
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:29.320
<v Speaker 4>subject and then really exploring that </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>

1015
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take the audience on a little trip.</v>

1016
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.500
<v Speaker 4>I know that's how I feel like when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the audience and I'm watching a </v>

1017
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:35.500
<v Speaker 4>really good comment and they start on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject,</v>

1018
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I want them to really explore that </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>

1019
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shit and that subject,</v>

1020
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:43.451

1027
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 4>in Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was nice because nobody even knew</v>

1028
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 4>who he was back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1029
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't even packed.</v>

1030
00:43:57.261 --> 00:44:02.261
<v Speaker 4>And I sat right on the front and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude would take a subject band and just </v>

1031
00:44:02.261 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 4>ring that motherfucker out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wring it out.</v>

1032
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 4>He would do a subject for like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>

1033
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.950
<v Speaker 4>And then right when you thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>

1034
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he comes up with something else and more</v>

1035
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>punchlines and more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like I was in awe.</v>

1036
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody does it like that.</v>

1037
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I think that guy's one of the most under</v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciated standups.</v>

1038
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 4>It was Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny,</v>

1039
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people like,</v>

1040
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't give him the credit that he </v>

1041
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 4>deserved because a lot of his premises </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like kind of common premises,</v>

1042
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1043
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>common,</v>

1044
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:31.650
<v Speaker 4>like almost like a talk show host,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a talk show host.</v>

1045
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1046
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:37.281
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing a spot on Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of his premise is just fit </v>

1047
00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:37.281
<v Speaker 4>right into the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1048
00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 4>letterman spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was so good.</v>

1049
00:44:38.611 --> 00:44:43.611
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His presence was brilliant on stage </v>

1050
00:44:43.611 --> 00:44:43.611
<v Speaker 4>timing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His timing was amazing.</v>

1051
00:44:43.611 --> 00:44:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Something that just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1052
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:51.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in a plane with me just a couple </v>

1053
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:55.850
<v Speaker 4>weeks before he killed himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a maybe maybe a couple months or </v>

1054
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something along those lines.</v>

1055
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 4>But he was headed to Austin and we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>headed to Austin to do a cap city comedy</v>

1056
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>

1057
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 4>And he was headed there for corporate </v>
<v Speaker 4>gig.</v>

1058
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:08.121
<v Speaker 4>And I got a chance to talk to them a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit and say hi to him and he just</v>

1059
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wish it had more,</v>

1060
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:14.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never really had like long </v>

1061
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.930
<v Speaker 4>conversations with the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1062
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 4>But I always felt like Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny is always going to be around,</v>

1063
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:20.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always see him at the Improv or </v>

1064
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:20.241
<v Speaker 4>whatever and say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was always friendly.</v>

1065
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:20.241
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1066
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 4>you see them there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

1067
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 4>You're going to a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

1068
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

1069
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.160
<v Speaker 4>A corporate gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

1070
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:24.640
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1072
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 4>all right man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have Fun.</v>

1073
00:45:25.711 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was like the conversation,</v>

1074
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1075
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I had talked to them,</v>

1076
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I picked his brain.</v>

1077
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I've seen bobcat yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The doctor's office.</v>

1078
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's he doing on the way in?</v>

1079
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Looks completely fucking different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real life.</v>

1080
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Like how just glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird glasses.</v>

1081
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.660
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at him at first and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at me and he's like,</v>

1082
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 4>on my bobcat and</v>

1083
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:51.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't do that no more.</v>

1084
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.070
<v Speaker 2>He was a funny comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was good to see him.</v>

1085
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Bob Camp does not get</v>

1086
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.270
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He deserves either because bobcat was in</v>

1087
00:45:58.271 --> 00:46:03.271
<v Speaker 4>those police academy movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so people didn't respect them like as a </v>

1088
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:03.271
<v Speaker 4>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as a comic,</v>

1089
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:05.740
<v Speaker 4>bobcat was fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meet Bob.</v>

1090
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that cd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking</v>

1091
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.260
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

1092
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I never knew he was a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the internet,</v>

1093
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 2>so I only saw him is he's still doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1094
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Still doing it with them like six years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and talking about.</v>

1095
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.160
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1096
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he still good?</v>

1097
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's your house sets now?</v>

1098
00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I think he just works for Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1099
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 2>so when he does stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just does it every now and then.</v>

1100
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then.</v>

1101
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a shame.</v>

1102
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:36.351
<v Speaker 2>He was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would have benefited from the internet </v>

1103
00:46:36.351 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 2>like crazy comedy clips or twitter at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

1104
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:41.691
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was that he was a perfect fit </v>

1105
00:46:41.691 --> 00:46:44.241
<v Speaker 2>for the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Internet had come along 10 years </v>

1106
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:44.241
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bobcat was a perfect fit.</v>

1107
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:48.561
<v Speaker 2>You imagined people's careers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If twitter and facebook and all this </v>

1108
00:46:48.561 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 2>shit like imagine Richard Pryor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>total prime.</v>

1109
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 2>If you had a facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a twitter page,</v>

1110
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 2>and all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenneth mentioned Tennyson's twitter.</v>

1111
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be every day.</v>

1112
00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Some copy off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll fuck it.</v>

1113
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have his twitter every day.</v>

1114
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It will be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys.</v>

1116
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean back then unfortunately there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>one avenue,</v>

1117
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 4>there was you had to get on television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to get on Hbo.</v>

1118
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 4>That would be the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get on one of those comedy specials.</v>

1119
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 4>But now there's so many avenues and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy now.</v>

1120
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always think about that,</v>

1121
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 4>like I would have been fucked if it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't for the Internet because I would </v>

1122
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.830
<v Speaker 4>have been always labeled as like a game </v>
<v Speaker 4>show host guy.</v>

1123
00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Like nobody would have taken my comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>

1124
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to,</v>

1125
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:29.960
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to see live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1126
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to know that I was actually comic first.</v>

1127
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 4>I just took fear factor for money back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

1128
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 4>But if you did like something that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know wasn't cohesive for a good career,</v>

1129
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.820
<v Speaker 4>like nobody forgive you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were labeled that guy and then they </v>

1130
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:44.820
<v Speaker 4>moved onto the next thing.</v>

1131
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't,</v>

1132
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:49.180
<v Speaker 4>you can't now because of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can completely express yourself.</v>

1133
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Like people know exactly who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Hollywood image and the studio pushed an</v>
<v Speaker 4>image for them and they had press.</v>

1143
00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:17.731
<v Speaker 4>People would talk to the press for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you had a publicist and publicists </v>

1144
00:48:17.731 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 4>are fucking useless now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're twittering,</v>

1145
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.780
<v Speaker 4>people know what you're really like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1146
00:48:19.781 --> 00:48:24.781
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at Spencer Pratt and all these </v>

1147
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:24.781
<v Speaker 4>fucking people.</v>

1148
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:24.781
<v Speaker 4>Anybody like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1149
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 4>that they become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become popular.</v>

1150
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 4>And then they just get to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have a million publicist,</v>

1151
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:32.851
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's going to know eventually </v>

1152
00:48:32.851 --> 00:48:33.300
<v Speaker 4>they're going to compile enough data to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know exactly what you're really like.</v>

1153
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.200
<v Speaker 4>They're going to know your lows and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>highs.</v>

1154
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make an honest judgment,</v>

1155
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Google knows everything about us.</v>

1156
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.060
<v Speaker 4>What we were talking about this apple </v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone thing,</v>

1157
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.360
<v Speaker 4>the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some new thing where apple's </v>

1158
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 4>collecting and sharing iphone users,</v>
<v Speaker 4>precise locations.</v>

1159
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.720
<v Speaker 4>And this is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an updated version of the privacy </v>

1160
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.971
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The company added a paragraph noting </v>

1161
00:48:56.971 --> 00:48:59.481
<v Speaker 4>that once users agree apple and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unspecified partners and licensees may </v>

1162
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 4>collect and store user location data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1163
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

1164
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>anonymous and I appreciate that.</v>

1165
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 4>But you're selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're selling data,</v>

1166
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.330
<v Speaker 4>you're collecting data on me and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>selling.</v>

1167
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>please don't.</v>

1168
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're there.</v>

1169
00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:21.371
<v Speaker 6>Gets a point where everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone needs to make money and I get </v>

1170
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:21.371
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

1171
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:22.610
<v Speaker 4>they're making the money that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>making.</v>

1172
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:25.640
<v Speaker 4>When you're doing stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these ads as spammers,</v>

1173
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.130
<v Speaker 4>you're making money off spammer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mega money off,</v>

1174
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.780
<v Speaker 4>people are going to find out where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in spam.</v>

1175
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.350
<v Speaker 6>I mean probably that's what it is and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what they're doing.</v>

1177
00:49:33.351 --> 00:49:34.430
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to find out where you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>at,</v>

1178
00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.680
<v Speaker 6>where you're buying things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you mind,</v>

1179
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.670
<v Speaker 6>and when you do eventually your phone is</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be like,</v>

1180
00:49:37.671 --> 00:49:41.300
<v Speaker 6>it isn't Japan to manage your money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's they're trying to customize.</v>

1181
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.220
<v Speaker 6>Just like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Customize your shopping,</v>

1182
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 6>shopping experiences and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we're talking about satellite </v>

1183
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.211
<v Speaker 6>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I am a huge fan of Pandora because </v>

1184
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:54.731
<v Speaker 6>it kind of makes you a radio station </v>
<v Speaker 6>based around what you like and.</v>

1185
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:57.710
<v Speaker 6>And it keeps on getting dreams off your </v>
<v Speaker 6>phone.</v>

1186
00:49:57.711 --> 00:49:58.410
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1187
00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.030
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 6>Especially the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd Bluetooth it right to my car and </v>

1189
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's great.</v>

1190
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.351
<v Speaker 6>It's like a nonstop radio stations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>satellite radio all based right around </v>

1191
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:09.720
<v Speaker 6>what you like and don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1192
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 4>What I was saying about the phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually becoming money in Japan.</v>

1193
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 4>You can buy things with your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally,</v>

1194
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you scan it or you send </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1195
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:21.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's commonplace and that's going to</v>

1196
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.040
<v Speaker 4>happen over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually,</v>

1197
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:28.090
<v Speaker 4>totally not going to start sharing data </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they know where your precise </v>

1198
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 4>locations</v>

1199
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v Speaker 1>are and you're buying things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get spam on your </v>

1200
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v Speaker 1>fullest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1201
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to happen once you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>photo or wherever the fuck no where you </v>

1202
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.051
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that if why would they </v>

1203
00:50:41.051 --> 00:50:41.051
<v Speaker 1>be paying for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not going to use it,</v>

1204
00:50:41.051 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>if they're gonna use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get some bullshit.</v>

1205
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be able to sell your </v>

1206
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking info unless it's benefiting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would your precise location benefit?</v>

1207
00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Like the company's development?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's something that you just </v>

1208
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:55.740
<v Speaker 1>have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1209
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:55.740
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't use it.</v>

1210
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Just like why would they was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchey thing that they're maximizing </v>

1211
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:05.051
<v Speaker 1>their profit and one of the ways they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it is by selling your private </v>

1212
00:51:05.051 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private information.</v>

1213
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You just become a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can become a digit,</v>

1214
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but they know exactly what you are.</v>

1215
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.550
<v Speaker 1>What kind of private information is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bank account or no?</v>

1216
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1217
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I think precisely what I think of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go every day,</v>

1218
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.670
<v Speaker 1>what your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1219
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 1>what your interests are like if you call</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 fucking sex lines.</v>

1220
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 1>So now one of those sex cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls a t and t and says,</v>

1221
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.000
<v Speaker 1>we want to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.000
<v Speaker 1>names from you of people who use lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1223
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1224
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:35.921
<v Speaker 1>At least a t and t is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you gotten a call </v>

1225
00:51:35.921 --> 00:51:35.921
<v Speaker 1>for a funeral parlor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't nobody dying with me.</v>

1226
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:41.020
<v Speaker 1>If somebody calls and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a Dick Sucking at least that </v>

1227
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's what the fuck.</v>

1228
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Nobody say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to vegas all the fucking time </v>

1229
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 1>from La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you go to Vegas for?</v>

1230
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Either they get your dick suck or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking gamble.</v>

1231
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280
<v Speaker 1>A regular consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's the data they're </v>

1232
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:57.340
<v Speaker 1>collecting and when they sell it out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1233
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times did you get closed joe </v>

1234
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:02.350
<v Speaker 1>from people trying to sell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

1235
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get,</v>

1236
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of those calls where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want you to change banks and </v>

1237
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 1>interest rates and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you think they,</v>

1238
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid.</v>

1239
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:15.101
<v Speaker 1>So somebody tells your phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they saw your panel or </v>

1240
00:52:15.101 --> 00:52:18.751
<v Speaker 1>your mother's maiden name guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think they sell your interest </v>

1241
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:21.290
<v Speaker 1>what you be with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very annoying when someone calls my</v>

1242
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 1>house and they have my name and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

1243
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me to.</v>

1244
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1248
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since I got rid of my home phone like </v>

1249
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 1>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a single stray call ever.</v>

1250
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit old school.</v>

1251
00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a home phone number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1252
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:40.520
<v Speaker 1>just in case I don't want to be relying </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my cell phone.</v>

1253
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little old school.</v>

1254
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 1>You ever go buy a car a week after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a car,</v>

1255
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you get an application for a credit card</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

1256
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just happens.</v>

1257
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bought the paper.</v>

1258
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Of course all your shit know what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst,</v>

1259
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.140
<v Speaker 1>it's where they take a car and put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mall and I was like,</v>

1260
00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:01.210
<v Speaker 1>sign up the witness' car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just the worst thing you could </v>

1261
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.571
<v Speaker 1>possibly ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks free of the fucking gym or </v>

1262
00:53:04.571 --> 00:53:08.070
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you see anything online that you </v>

1263
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:08.070
<v Speaker 1>can give you information about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1264
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but I always knew they were doing see </v>
<v Speaker 1>once nine slash 11 came dog,</v>

1265
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 1>this became more available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what law was passed.</v>

1266
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>We lost a lot of fucking freedoms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know we had.</v>

1267
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.660
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's people are freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1268
00:53:20.661 --> 00:53:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know that I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's to do with nine slash 11,</v>

1269
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're absolutely executive orders </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Bush</v>

1270
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 4>passed and Cheney pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of freedoms pro.</v>

1271
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 4>So this is part of the freedoms that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>will lose that people complain about.</v>

1272
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This couldn't have happened 20 years </v>

1273
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.041
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I used to get called from </v>

1274
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Sealy posturepedic trying to sell you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking mattress and you're like,</v>

1275
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:45.681
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want no matches because your </v>

1276
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:45.681
<v Speaker 4>name just got sold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1277
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:45.681
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1278
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:50.570
<v Speaker 4>what do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think they concentrate on </v>

1279
00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.121
<v Speaker 4>taking rights away?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they concentrate on taking </v>

1280
00:53:53.121 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 4>rights away because they're worried that</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit is eventually gonna hit the fan and</v>

1281
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:58.851
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to have to really </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to control people so </v>

1282
00:53:58.851 --> 00:53:58.851
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulations,</v>

1283
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 4>more ways to lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why else would they be struggling to try</v>

1284
00:54:01.381 --> 00:54:06.381
<v Speaker 4>to get more control over people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would they be struggling to take </v>

1285
00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:09.231
<v Speaker 4>away your rights and liberties unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's profit or unless they can </v>

1286
00:54:09.231 --> 00:54:11.880
<v Speaker 4>control you in some sort of a time of </v>
<v Speaker 4>great stress in disasters,</v>

1287
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.510
<v Speaker 6>just protection.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you know,</v>

1288
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 6>if you don't murder murder one and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fine,</v>

1289
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're just collecting</v>

1290
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.080
<v Speaker 4>not true because the government can </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely target people who are enemies</v>

1291
00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:26.081
<v Speaker 4>of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have taken people out of the </v>

1292
00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:26.081
<v Speaker 4>Green Party and put them on terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch lists and no fly list just because</v>

1293
00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 4>they protest against the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fact.</v>

1294
00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:29.900
<v Speaker 4>That's already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's already done,</v>

1295
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:33.890
<v Speaker 4>so there's no way they're doing it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to protect you.</v>

1296
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.920
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't need to protect you like </v>

1297
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:38.920
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they needed to protect you like that,</v>

1298
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.821
<v Speaker 4>it would be much more obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sis It at a certain point in time.</v>

1299
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:45.800
<v Speaker 4>It was like how much information is </v>

<v Speaker 5>it's not carpet burn.</v>

1600
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.990
<v Speaker 5>I told you I was drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what I was doing and I was</v>

1601
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 5>like leaning against this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like this crazy lion bitch.</v>

1602
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 5>It was like the dumbest lie ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this dumb whore.</v>

1603
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:53.140
<v Speaker 5>Didn't even know that she had this </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking scab on her back getting fucked </v>

1604
01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:53.990
<v Speaker 5>so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably in the dirt somewhere.</v>

1605
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:59.350
<v Speaker 5>Crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's probably on destruction site and </v>

1606
01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:01.530
<v Speaker 5>an asphalt parking lot of broken glass </v>
<v Speaker 5>and 21 or 22.</v>

1607
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.820
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe I might have been a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>older.</v>

1608
01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was ridiculous,</v>

1609
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 5>but I'd already cheated on her so I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't care.</v>

1610
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.550
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a bad relationship.</v>

1611
01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 5>I didn't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a fun one,</v>

1612
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she keeps,</v>

1613
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 5>she keeps a comedy show that night with </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

1614
01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:19.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as she got back or can you close on this</v>

1615
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 5>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we went and we left.</v>

1616
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:25.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember if I fucked her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably not because I was probably </v>

1617
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 5>grossed out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it took her to my comedy show.</v>

1618
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.500
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to come with me and she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>planning on it,</v>

1619
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:32.710
<v Speaker 5>so I got on stage and immediately go </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the whole fucking story about my </v>

1620
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:36.791
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go into a spring break and coming back </v>

1621
01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:36.890
<v Speaker 5>with rug burn and I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1622
01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1623
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:40.790
<v Speaker 5>what's worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I put that one out.</v>

1624
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:43.580
<v Speaker 5>Like how would you react to that one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I tell the whole story.</v>

1625
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.850
<v Speaker 5>She was fucking furious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was so mad.</v>

1626
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.680
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have fucking believe me,</v>

1627
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.820
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe you.</v>

1628
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.320
<v Speaker 5>But it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a joke.</v>

1629
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just pretending that you really did </v>

1630
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 5>fuck somebody on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best thing about facebook,</v>

1631
01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:01.080
<v Speaker 5>the best thing about facebook is finding</v>
<v Speaker 5>your old babysitter and like,</v>

1632
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I remember this babysitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just fucking hot and she's still </v>

<v Speaker 5>You have a kitchen.</v>

1635
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.160
<v Speaker 5>She never touched me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what she let me do it.</v>

1636
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.850
<v Speaker 5>Let me put my head in her crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1637
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 5>like sleep in her crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know</v>

1638
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:19.010

<v Speaker 2>and then like I would move my head </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1640
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:22.770

<v Speaker 2>I just remember what's so fucking.</v>

1641
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:25.350

<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say 11,</v>

1642
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>10 little pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pussy.</v>

1643
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:30.260
<v Speaker 2>He was giving her a fucking forehead and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1644
01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 2>and then the shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember she would just have the </v>

1645
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>blanket over her and like be watching TV</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll be like underneath the blanket,</v>

1646
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:41.901
<v Speaker 2>just do whatever I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was this one time I </v>

1647
01:11:41.901 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>remember if it's the best feeling in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1648
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I remember I climbed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put my hands on both sides of her tits </v>

1649
01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>and just laid on top of her since she </v>
<v Speaker 2>let you do that.</v>

1650
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1651
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:52.590
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found her on facebook.</v>

1652
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Chick is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a fucking child molester.</v>

1653
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Ten years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making you eat a box.</v>

1654
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.400
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1655
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like your bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking loved it.</v>

1656
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:04.140
<v Speaker 2>It was the greatest thing in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire room you think it is.</v>

1657
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that she's just a total </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention whore and she just couldn't?</v>

1658
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was probably 16 or 18.</v>

1659
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 2>She was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1660
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1661
01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I found her on facebook and she's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda hot and she's divorced.</v>

1662
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1663
01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>will you get drinks sometime?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that be cool?</v>

1664
01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Wish you wish you live a Delaware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Delaware,</v>

1665
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Maryland shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are you planning on trying to bang </v>

1666
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:37.641
<v Speaker 2>this out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that would be kind of high </v>

1667
01:12:37.641 --> 01:12:39.270
<v Speaker 2>to Banger to bang them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know we started something 30 years ago.</v>

1668
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.780
<v Speaker 2>That would be the longest relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever had.</v>

1669
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:47.170
<v Speaker 5>Maybe like five years old than you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she'd be like 40 you think?</v>

1670
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1671
01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:51.600
<v Speaker 5>So 40.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's probably still lubing up itself.</v>

1672
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Still still do it once.</v>

<v Speaker 5>together and you just want to get the </v>

1688
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.360

<v Speaker 5>Some people just want someone.</v>

1689
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.560
<v Speaker 5>They get so poisoned by music and songs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stories that they want it to work </v>

1690
01:13:45.691 --> 01:13:48.270
<v Speaker 5>out the way it does in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want it to be like that.</v>

1691
01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:50.310
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to be some special person in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their life.</v>

1692
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 5>So even if it's not a special connection</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have with some person,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had a 21 old chick that used to grab</v>

1700
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 4>my deck when I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't actually fuck her,</v>

1701
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:19.711
<v Speaker 4>but she would make out with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would tongue kiss her and she grabbed </v>

1704
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 4>I was like totally paranoid panicked and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1705
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.290

<v Speaker 4>I didn't know exactly what was going on.</v>

1706
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 4>Like I had never even orgasm before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never masturbated before.</v>

<v Speaker 4>puppets and shit.</v>

1866
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 4>And he apparently had a TV show that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really popular in Jersey.</v>

1867
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:03.770
<v Speaker 4>I did that show and uncle floyd would do</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup and I didn't know who the fuck </v>

<v Speaker 4>I can't believe what I'm watching it.</v>

1870
01:21:09.811 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 4>But to them it's like nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1873
01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 4>So I had a fall uncle floyd and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating Dick,</v>

1874
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:21.450
<v Speaker 4>eating Dick onstage falling uncle floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted to hear me,</v>

1875
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they had just heard this guy and </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1877
01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.270
<v Speaker 4>and I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did you shoot this at?</v>

1878
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:29.370
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This wasn't a TV show,</v>

1879
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 4>this was just doing standup in Jersey.</v>

1880
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:36.970
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was right on 68th and was right </v>

1881
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:36.970
<v Speaker 4>over the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even remember that.</v>

1882
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:41.961
<v Speaker 4>It was a place that was on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a place that was actually on the </v>

1883
01:21:41.961 --> 01:21:46.431
<v Speaker 4>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like an outdoor little venue and </v>

1884
01:21:46.431 --> 01:21:46.980
<v Speaker 4>it probably sat like maybe a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1885
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300.</v>

1886
01:21:48.391 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my memory's real shaky from this time,</v>

1887
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 4>but I remember this guy went up and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had never heard of them,</v>

1888
01:21:53.581 --> 01:21:55.470
<v Speaker 4>but they went nuts when he went onstage </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like,</v>

1889
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.740
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they told me,</v>

1890
01:21:56.750 --> 01:22:01.750
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a local New Jersey television </v>

1891
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.750

<v Speaker 4>But it was like really clean too.</v>

1893
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 4>So after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst thing you want is </v>

1894
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 4>someone killing when they're clean and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you go on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>To do what you got to fucking do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dropped a package off.</v>

2258
01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 3>What they used to do is they would fly </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2259
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:04.870
<v Speaker 3>he would fly in from South America and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little propeller plane flying to </v>

01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:07.421
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped a package off in Paris by </v>

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.780
<v Speaker 3>parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of the plane,</v>

2262
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:11.630
<v Speaker 3>and then the guys would go at the drop </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot and pick up the parachute.</v>

2263
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.210
<v Speaker 3>They show up in a pickup truck or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they use.</v>

2264
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kids were fucking around in the </v>

2265
01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:21.101
<v Speaker 3>woods and these kids spotted the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parachute drop and when they went to go </v>

2266
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.160
<v Speaker 3>pick up the package,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they saw these kids.</v>

2267
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:27.161
<v Speaker 3>They're so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed the kids and they took the </v>

2268
01:37:27.161 --> 01:37:28.070
<v Speaker 3>kids bodies and they laid them on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tracks and yeah.</v>

2269
01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And the autopsy came back so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids were high and they fell asleep on </v>

2270
01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:33.130
<v Speaker 3>the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the parents said,</v>

2271
01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.480
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my children didn't do drugs.</v>

2273
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:40.481
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the parents paid for their own </v>

2274
01:37:40.481 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 3>autopsies and their own autopsy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>concluded that the kids were murdered,</v>

2275
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:44.120
<v Speaker 3>that they were stabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found stab wounds on the body,</v>

2276
01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.420
<v Speaker 3>so the parents like started trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the fuck went wrong and </v>

2277
01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.231
<v Speaker 3>they started figuring out who landed </v>
<v Speaker 3>planes and what happened and blah blah </v>

2278
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:53.231
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

2279
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>And then they busted Scott Barry Seals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bearings seals a fucking employee of</v>

2280
01:37:56.251 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 3>the CIA who had been flying drugs into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country for decades.</v>

2281
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.430
<v Speaker 3>And he said that that's just what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2282
01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:07.431
<v Speaker 3>That's what they've always done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's money out there to be made and </v>

2283
01:38:07.431 --> 01:38:09.861
<v Speaker 3>they know it and they make it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the same people that are </v>

2284
01:38:09.861 --> 01:38:10.650
<v Speaker 3>willing to start wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to do that whole Gulf of</v>

2285
01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:15.651
<v Speaker 3>Tonkin thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the Vietnam War war under </v>

2286
01:38:15.651 --> 01:38:17.931
<v Speaker 3>false pretenses and false flag attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>just in order to make sure that we're </v>

2287
01:38:17.931 --> 01:38:20.340
<v Speaker 3>involved in disputes with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and one of the things they do.</v>

2288
01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:25.341
<v Speaker 3>We're involved with disputes over other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries as they jacked or natural </v>

2289
01:38:25.341 --> 01:38:26.340
<v Speaker 3>resources and one of their natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources or drugs.</v>

2290
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.820
<v Speaker 3>And what you don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan is a fucking gigantic money </v>

2291
01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 3>hole for those evil scumbags that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to do shit like that.</v>

2292
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:34.910
<v Speaker 3>There's so much money there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

2293
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:40.040
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you do when there's 90 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the world's anything in one </v>

2294
01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:40.500
<v Speaker 3>spot that's worth billions of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billions.</v>

2295
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Billions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a ridiculous thing.</v>

2296
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:43.470
<v Speaker 3>If you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a nut.</v>

2297
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:48.710
<v Speaker 3>If you start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason why we're in </v>

2298
01:38:48.710 --> 01:38:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan is because someone's making </v>
<v Speaker 3>money off drugs.</v>

2299
01:38:48.710 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely got to be something to</v>

2300
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:51.060
<v Speaker 3>do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think you're crazy.</v>

2301
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not the whole reason we're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't think it plays a part,</v>

2302
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't think it has a saying who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>making money during the war.</v>

2303
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:01.170
<v Speaker 3>You've got to fight that fucking war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think finances this shit,</v>

2304
01:39:01.171 --> 01:39:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2305
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing that happened during the</v>

2306
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Reagan administration with the Contras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307
01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

2308
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that Michael Rupert Guy Busted the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling drugs in Los Angeles,</v>

2309
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 3>ghettos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2310
01:39:15.151 --> 01:39:20.151
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just standard operational </v>

2311
01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:22.911
<v Speaker 3>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just takes a while for it to pop out </v>

2312
01:39:22.911 --> 01:39:22.911
<v Speaker 3>and get into the new sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2313
01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:26.140
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck do you see Ari Shaffir on </v>
<v Speaker 5>tmz today?</v>

2314
01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:28.260
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there.</v>

2316
01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.740
<v Speaker 5>That was a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

2317
01:39:29.741 --> 01:39:34.741
<v Speaker 5>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>him in a way that Rowdy Roddy Piper a </v>

2318
01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:36.720
<v Speaker 5>got a Roddy Roddy Piper beat him up on </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

2319
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2320
01:39:37.381 --> 01:39:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking that he would really was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

2321
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.580
<v Speaker 3>which is a big problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

2322
01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 3>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know that it's an act,</v>

2323
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:48.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's just trying to get people's </v>

2324
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:50.631
<v Speaker 3>reactions and just be a nut and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>people react to this fake racist </v>

2325
01:39:50.631 --> 01:39:52.020
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get angry at him,</v>

2326
01:39:52.021 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 3>but he's not really racist.</v>

2327
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:54.020
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2328
01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:59.021
<v Speaker 5>he kind of is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone else kidding or he's not a </v>

2329
01:39:59.871 --> 01:40:04.871
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is a very open mind and objective </v>

2330
01:40:04.871 --> 01:40:04.880
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's kind of funny that already would</v>

2331
01:40:04.881 --> 01:40:09.881
<v Speaker 5>be playing this character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amazing racist because it was a </v>

2332
01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:12.581
<v Speaker 5>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was national lampoon and it should </v>

2333
01:40:12.581 --> 01:40:14.811
<v Speaker 5>have moved on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do you think he should have moved </v>

2334
01:40:14.811 --> 01:40:14.811
<v Speaker 5>on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it should have.</v>

2335
01:40:14.811 --> 01:40:15.620
<v Speaker 5>I've told him many times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you told him,</v>

2336
01:40:15.621 --> 01:40:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think the character has done</v>

2337
01:40:17.601 --> 01:40:18.250
<v Speaker 5>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2338
01:40:18.251 --> 01:40:23.251
<v Speaker 5>the whole idea that character is done </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you don't want to really be known </v>

2339
01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:23.251
<v Speaker 5>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the calculus,</v>

2340
01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:25.280
<v Speaker 5>I would've kept doing videos as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>character with new ideas,</v>

2341
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:29.050
<v Speaker 5>but I really want you to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think at a certain point in time,</v>

2342
01:40:29.051 --> 01:40:31.100
<v Speaker 5>it's like how many stereotypes you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to experience it.</v>

2343
01:40:31.101 --> 01:40:31.850
<v Speaker 5>It's a joke.</v>

2344
01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:33.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you already did the job.</v>

2345
01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.900
<v Speaker 5>There was no reason to keep on doing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same joke over and over again.</v>

2346
01:40:35.901 --> 01:40:40.901
<v Speaker 5>I think he didn't do a Jewish one and be</v>
<v Speaker 5>done because he had too much success </v>

2347
01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.590
<v Speaker 5>with it and he just got caught up in it </v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep it going.</v>

2348
01:40:42.591 --> 01:40:43.740
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2349
01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.770
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the most successful things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's done.</v>

2350
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:47.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the National Lampoon thing,</v>

2351
01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:52.230
<v Speaker 5>pretty famous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't see me make still making car </v>

2352
01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:52.230
<v Speaker 5>lisman sia videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

2353
01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:56.670
<v Speaker 5>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was probably my most successful </v>

2354
01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:56.840
<v Speaker 5>video I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2355
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 5>absolutely the best video I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

2356
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.400
<v Speaker 5>That's actually what all the girls like </v>
<v Speaker 5>to that stuff.</v>

2357
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.630
<v Speaker 5>It's Hilarious when the cat reacts to </v>
<v Speaker 5>your Forte.</v>

2358
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:07.750
<v Speaker 5>There's one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see that one where I did.</v>

2359
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.370
<v Speaker 5>Did Lindsay Lohan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2360
01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I saw that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was pretty ridiculous.</v>

2361
01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:17.170
<v Speaker 5>So now what happened when Lindsay Lohan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I drink that Kombucha shit and </v>

2362
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:19.630
<v Speaker 5>everybody's saying that Lindsay Lohan </v>
<v Speaker 5>lied and she said that her bracelet went</v>

2363
01:41:19.631 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 5>off because she was drinking that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kombucha.</v>

2364
01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:24.470
<v Speaker 5>Kombucha has a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a level of alcohol,</v>

2365
01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:29.500
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was pulled off the shelves </v>

2366
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:33.391
<v Speaker 5>off a whole foods and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some questioning about the </v>

2367
01:41:33.391 --> 01:41:35.220
<v Speaker 5>alcohol content that it's less than</v>

2368
01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.810
<v Speaker 3>one half of a percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2369
01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to mark it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it's more than one half of a </v>

2370
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.061
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to market and they're saying </v>

2371
01:41:44.061 --> 01:41:44.061
<v Speaker 3>it's more.</v>

2372
01:41:44.061 --> 01:41:46.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she was wearing winter this scam </v>

2373
01:41:46.190 --> 01:41:47.940
<v Speaker 5>bracelets and it went off and supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what made it go off.</v>

2374
01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Now I don't know if that's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2375
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that you're not even supposed </v>

2376
01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:55.860
<v Speaker 3>to have any Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're an alcoholic,</v>

2377
01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:56.980
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to drink that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even taste like alcohol,</v>

2378
01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

2379
01:41:57.551 --> 01:41:58.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was rolling.</v>

2380
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 3>I did Jujitsu after I drank one and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude's head.</v>

2381
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Did you have a beer before you went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>juices and.</v>

2382
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking Kombucha.</v>

2383
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:05.610
<v Speaker 3>It's all healthy and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2384
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 3>But I mean maybe it has this little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of alcohol in it,</v>

2385
01:42:08.231 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 3>but I've never gotten drunk off it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>even felt a buzz.</v>

2386
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:12.610
<v Speaker 3>But I'll tell you one thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pumped.</v>

2387
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.860

<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get sick anymore.</v>

2389
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:16.900

<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

2393
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd fuck it.</v>

2394
01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:23.740
<v Speaker 3>I think they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like the regular?</v>

2395
01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.820
<v Speaker 3>The best?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the regular.</v>

2396
01:42:24.821 --> 01:42:25.500
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That other one?</v>

2398
01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're great.</v>

2399
01:42:28.151 --> 01:42:31.840
<v Speaker 3>One to show gingerade the Ginger Ale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this kind of strong.</v>

2400
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 3>It's got a kick to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the regular ones.</v>

2401
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm telling you man,</v>

2402
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 3>all this travel I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting sick all the time.</v>

2403
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:40.870
<v Speaker 3>It was like every couple months I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>battling and I'm still working out.</v>

2404
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still training,</v>

2405
01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm working out as hard as I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out and I'm not getting sick.</v>

2406
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy and I think it has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probiotics,</v>

2407
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 3>staying really regular with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamins.</v>

2408
01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:55.740
<v Speaker 3>That's very important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also maintaining a healthy </v>

2409
01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:58.051
<v Speaker 3>bacteria level in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acidophilus and probiotic drinks on the </v>

2410
01:42:58.051 --> 01:43:02.701
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the acidophilus with me and I </v>

2411
01:43:02.701 --> 01:43:02.701
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2412
01:43:02.701 --> 01:43:05.161
<v Speaker 3>take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I'm at home I drink those </v>

2413
01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:05.161
<v Speaker 3>fucking drinks and I'm not getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2414
01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to so many different </v>

2415
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:09.540
<v Speaker 3>varieties of germs and bullshit when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the road.</v>

2416
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Plus I'm way more careful now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like washing my hands before I eat</v>

2417
01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.790
<v Speaker 5>and strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the creek we look at.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The fucking the fetal this weekend.</v>

2419
01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:21.780
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about this.</v>

2420
01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:24.360
<v Speaker 5>Is this is the bottom line failed or had</v>
<v Speaker 5>never fought.</v>

2421
01:43:24.361 --> 01:43:25.010
<v Speaker 5>A guy who's got a</v>

<v Speaker 3>garlic for doom and who is he training </v>
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>

2423
01:43:27.021 --> 01:43:32.021
<v Speaker 3>He's not training with anybody like is </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the food chain Abu Dhabi champion</v>

2424
01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.210
<v Speaker 3>and he's a big man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like six foot three,</v>

2425
01:43:35.211 --> 01:43:35.900
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

2426
01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:39.800
<v Speaker 3>He's a big fucking dude and he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His guard is nasty.</v>

2427
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:41.300
<v Speaker 3>He's got one of the best cars in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2428
01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.340
<v Speaker 3>You try getting sloppy with grounded </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound leave arms in there.</v>

2429
01:43:44.341 --> 01:43:49.341
<v Speaker 3>He got snatched those arms up quick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a tight game and the beginning </v>

2430
01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:49.910
<v Speaker 3>of the round Fado wasn't slippery yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2431
01:43:49.911 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 3>no one's sweaty and they're just barely</v>

2432
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:57.250
<v Speaker 4>broken a sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's got like a nice grip on a man </v>

2433
01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:57.250
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing man.</v>

2434
01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 4>You let them catch you and you in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>technique battle.</v>

2435
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:02.370
<v Speaker 4>You battle his guard from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

2436
01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.460
<v Speaker 4>you know when you're on top and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave an arm in there,</v>

2437
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.580
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna fuck you up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because as you go to defend,</v>

2438
01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 4>he set him up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2439
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 4>it was really beautiful to watch what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

2440
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 4>He attacked the arm and as fate or is </v>
<v Speaker 4>defending the arm,</v>

2441
01:44:15.351 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 4>he's got a pull the arm back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as he's defending the arm,</v>

2442
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:20.930
<v Speaker 4>pull the arm back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when he slaps a triangle on.</v>

2443
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:26.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like he just put him in a classic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian Jujitsu chain of submissions.</v>

2444
01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:26.930
<v Speaker 4>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2445
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 4>you defend this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes to that,</v>

2446
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:30.590
<v Speaker 4>and as you defend the triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you expose the arm.</v>

2447
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 4>As you protect the arm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the triangle gets locked deeper.</v>

2448
01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:33.590
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2449
01:44:33.591 --> 01:44:35.120
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was beautiful man.</v>

2450
01:44:35.121 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 4>It was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look fate or is a bad motherfucker.</v>

2451
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:40.370
<v Speaker 4>He's really like a guy who could fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>at two.</v>

2452
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five easy.</v>

2453
01:44:41.811 --> 01:44:44.120
<v Speaker 4>And he's fighting at heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocking guys out.</v>

2454
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's only six feet tall.</v>

2455
01:44:45.801 --> 01:44:48.650
<v Speaker 4>He's not a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people say he's actually only 5:11.</v>

2456
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:53.950
<v Speaker 4>He's not a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's incredibly talented and </v>

2457
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.950
<v Speaker 4>incredibly inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2458
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:55.850
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a dude that makes people,</v>

2459

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2460

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2461
01:44:57.441 --> 01:45:02.441
<v Speaker 4>they love the way he carries himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he handled the last man to hear </v>

2462
01:45:02.441 --> 01:45:02.630
<v Speaker 4>what he said afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2463
01:45:02.631 --> 01:45:03.190
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2464
01:45:03.191 --> 01:45:04.990
<v Speaker 4>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel nothing goes [inaudible] you.</v>

2465
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't stand it.</v>

2466
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:11.981
<v Speaker 4>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who don't fall don't know what </v>

2468
01:45:11.981 --> 01:45:11.981
<v Speaker 4>it's like to stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When was his last fight?</v>

2469
01:45:11.981 --> 01:45:12.380
<v Speaker 4>Like main fight before?</v>

2470
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.610
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't like seven years ago or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2471
01:45:13.611 --> 01:45:15.160
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are people saying?</v>

2472
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.310
<v Speaker 4>You know he beat Brett Rogers less than </v>
<v Speaker 4>a shit.</v>

2473
01:45:18.370 --> 01:45:20.280
<v Speaker 4>It was only a few months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Months ago.</v>

2474
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Less than probably a blast and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked him out,</v>

2475
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:28.750
<v Speaker 4>but right after he beat them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alistair overeem beat the fuck out of </v>

2476
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Brett Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alistair overeem own bread.</v>

2477
01:45:31.041 --> 01:45:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

2478
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:34.400
<v Speaker 4>The way he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man was so precise on the feet,</v>

2479
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.560
<v Speaker 4>just high level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking Moitai tie.</v>

2480
01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Slipping the punch and the Shin slams </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the meat of the lake.</v>

2481
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:43.730
<v Speaker 4>You could see like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett Rogers like,</v>

2482
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:46.250
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you could see right away.</v>

2483
01:45:46.251 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 4>He was in way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2484
01:45:47.721 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2485
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 4>way over his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Alastar got Brett,</v>

2486
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Raj on the ground and fucking pummeled </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2487
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 4>It moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a ridiculously one sided fight.</v>

2488
01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.900
<v Speaker 4>What kind of party is Dana White having </v>
<v Speaker 4>this weekend?</v>

2489
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.620
<v Speaker 4>It's having a big party and having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking laugh your ass off.</v>

2490
01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I just saved $30,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>because now fate or unfortunately really</v>

2491
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 4>does become irrelevant because part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what made him exciting was the fact that</v>

2492
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:14.021
<v Speaker 4>he was this undefeated guy who seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be a superhuman and destroys tim.</v>

2493
01:46:14.631 --> 01:46:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Silvia destroys Andre Arlovski is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an aura about him.</v>

2494
01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Some of the aura was eroded slightly by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Brett Rogers fight because Brett </v>

2495
01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Rogers got him down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was grounded,</v>

2496
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:29.350
<v Speaker 4>pounded him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was connecting with big shots and you </v>

2497
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.350
<v Speaker 4>looked at it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if brock got him in that spot?</v>

2498
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:33.230
<v Speaker 4>If Baraka Baraka named Brett Rogers pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>brock gets you in that spot a,</v>

2499
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:34.790
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>

2500
01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.530
<v Speaker 4>you're going to eat some giant cinder </v>
<v Speaker 4>block.</v>

2501
01:46:36.531 --> 01:46:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Fucking canned ham fists this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be crazy limitations.</v>

2502
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:41.090
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2503
01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:46.091
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that eroded people's confidence in fate </v>

2504
01:46:46.091 --> 01:46:46.130
<v Speaker 4>or a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what eroded my confidence,</v>

2505
01:46:46.131 --> 01:46:49.320
<v Speaker 4>and it is when I saw the way alice star </v>
<v Speaker 4>handled Brett Rogers,</v>

2506
01:46:49.321 --> 01:46:50.150
<v Speaker 4>I knew Alastar</v>

2507
01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:55.180
<v Speaker 3>was going to fuck bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know he's going to do it </v>

2508
01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he did it was perfect.</v>

2509
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2510
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:59.780
<v Speaker 3>he shows how high level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his striking is me beat Badr Hari,</v>

2511
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:04.790
<v Speaker 3>not Badr Hari Out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is one of the very best kick boxers </v>

2512
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.790
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2513
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's beaten a lot of dudes.</v>

2514
01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:07.710
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up Peter Hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2515
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.180
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knocks dudes out,</v>

2516
01:47:09.181 --> 01:47:14.181
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker in kickboxing </v>

2517
01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:14.181
<v Speaker 3>with the best in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2518
01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:15.920
<v Speaker 3>he's hanging with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he got in there again,</v>

2519
01:47:15.921 --> 01:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like an MMA fighter who's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>brawler.</v>

2520
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 3>He just opened up a can on them and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2521
01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:25.670
<v Speaker 3>fate or is not a technical striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very explosive and very fast and </v>

2522
01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:27.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's good and tough and his technique is</v>

2523
01:47:27.451 --> 01:47:32.451
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not like a guy who could just </v>

2524
01:47:32.451 --> 01:47:32.451
<v Speaker 3>step into k one the way our star does.</v>

2525
01:47:32.451 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 3>And Alastar has a nasty ground game as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2526
01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:37.470
<v Speaker 3>So the transition between the two of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them is very smooth.</v>

2527
01:47:37.471 --> 01:47:39.840
<v Speaker 3>And when he took Brett Rogers down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just controlled him on the ground and</v>

2528
01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:43.140
<v Speaker 3>beat the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really made a mockery over Faye doors</v>

2529
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:43.800
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2530
01:47:43.801 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2531
01:47:45.670 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it wasn't the same night.</v>

2532
01:47:47.071 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way he beat him,</v>

2533
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2534
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:55.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alastar to me is more exciting really </v>

2535
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:57.951
<v Speaker 3>right now than Fader al stores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the scariest guys in the </v>

2536
01:47:57.951 --> 01:47:57.951
<v Speaker 3>divisionK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>,</v>

2537
01:47:57.951 --> 01:48:02.330
<v Speaker 3>one level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high level striking and nasty Brazilian </v>

2538
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2539
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:04.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>European Abu Dhabi trials submitted Vito</v>

2540
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Belfort instead of fucking sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He a team man,</v>

2541
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.090
<v Speaker 3>what do you think fader or would have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do to earn back?</v>

2542
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:09.870
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2543
01:48:09.871 --> 01:48:12.420
<v Speaker 3>that is on top of his game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who would he have to fight with?</v>

2544
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:17.420
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to the UFC now or you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go to the UFC and I've or fight </v>

2545
01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Alastar and then go to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in for doom again too.</v>

2546
01:48:18.931 --> 01:48:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited to see him fight anybody.</v>

2547
01:48:20.671 --> 01:48:22.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I'm not afraid or fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him,</v>

2548
01:48:22.861 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 3>but I think you've got to fight the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in the world.</v>

2549
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:30.980
<v Speaker 3>You got to be in the heat with the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in the world and there's really no </v>

2550
01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:31.800
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no shortcuts for,</v>

2551
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:34.700
<v Speaker 3>for training with a guy like for real </v>
<v Speaker 3>silver dome.</v>

2552
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:37.410
<v Speaker 3>There's no shortcuts to learning how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of a guard like that.</v>

2553
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You've got to experience it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious watching that fight that,</v>

2554
01:48:40.301 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably hadn't,</v>

2555
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.930
<v Speaker 3>hadn't experienced that kind of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2556
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2557
01:48:43.951 --> 01:48:45.840
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's made some critical errors.</v>

2558
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:51.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a beautiful video where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>Henry Gracie and his brother breakdown </v>

2559
01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:52.800
<v Speaker 3>what would fade or did wrong and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing.</v>

2560
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 3>It was playing the triangle as </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

2561
01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

2562
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are looking at and they're like,</v>

2563
01:48:57.481 --> 01:49:02.481
<v Speaker 3>this is like simple Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made mistakes and part of these mix </v>

2564
01:49:02.481 --> 01:49:05.720
<v Speaker 3>tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's got a very unorthodox </v>

2565
01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.191
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws big haymakers inside the </v>

2566
01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:07.191
<v Speaker 3>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been really successful with that.</v>

2567
01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:08.700
<v Speaker 3>But with a guy like for doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

2568
01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:09.480
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

2569
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 3>he's there to catch those little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny openings,</v>

2570
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put a beating on him that,</v>

2571
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 3>you know what it was really exciting </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that nightmare.</v>

2572
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Kung Lee is bringing a taekwondo back </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

2573
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 3>has that fucking step in turning </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidekick.</v>

2574
01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:30.290
<v Speaker 3>He stands in a southpaw stance with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>right leg forward and he throws a left </v>

2575
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:33.030
<v Speaker 3>like steps for throwing a left and dudes</v>
<v Speaker 3>back out of the way,</v>

2576
01:49:33.031 --> 01:49:36.330
<v Speaker 3>just of the punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at turning sidekick comes behind it.</v>

2577
01:49:36.331 --> 01:49:40.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's a 360 degree turning sidekick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stands with his right leg forward,</v>

2578
01:49:40.770 --> 01:49:43.000
<v Speaker 3>throws the lefthand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as he throws the lefthand,</v>

2579
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.020
<v Speaker 3>he steps forward with the left foot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then spins.</v>

2580
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 3>So there's so much momentum and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like running</v>

2581
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:52.060
<v Speaker 5>at you with that kick and blasts you </v>
<v Speaker 5>his.</v>

2582
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 5>He's doing shit with kicks man that </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people aren't doing.</v>

2583
01:49:55.390 --> 01:50:00.390
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way he throws that three 60 turning </v>

2584
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.390
<v Speaker 5>sidekick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see anybody else doing that.</v>

2585
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:04.471
<v Speaker 5>If you guys do a turning sidekick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't see anybody else doing that </v>

2586
01:50:04.471 --> 01:50:07.900
<v Speaker 5>three 60 like he does it and his kicks </v>
<v Speaker 5>are fucking deadly man.</v>

2587
01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of high kicks to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 5>think he's just going to get smashed </v>
<v Speaker 5>brained.</v>

2753
01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:16.210
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2754
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:21.440
<v Speaker 5>So you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about the fact that chain car one </v>

2755
01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:21.440

<v Speaker 5>I mean physically at least on paper,</v>

2756
01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.120
<v Speaker 5>the same size,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2757
01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:25.750
<v Speaker 5>it weighs the same amount and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>knocked out every single person bro.</v>

2758
01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:26.960
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking different dance.</v>

2759
01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.040
<v Speaker 5>He's a big debts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a big fucking rock has been </v>

2760
01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:32.040
<v Speaker 5>there before.</v>

<v Speaker 5>competitive and he really feels that.</v>

2762
01:57:34.861 --> 01:57:39.861
<v Speaker 5>I bet he needs to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just got a lot of time to think </v>

2763
01:57:39.861 --> 01:57:41.770
<v Speaker 5>about shit and a lot of training to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's just,</v>

2764
01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:46.820
<v Speaker 5>he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna probably be more ready now </v>

2765
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:46.820
<v Speaker 5>than he's ever been in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

2766
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:46.820
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2767
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:48.600
<v Speaker 5>he's not even cutting weight is walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>around at like two 65.</v>

2768
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:50.490
<v Speaker 5>He's lost weight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but fat.</v>

2769
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:55.790
<v Speaker 5>He's like ripped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was looking really good chicken like </v>

2770
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his mass is thick because now he's on </v>

2771
01:57:57.690 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 5>this really a vegetable diet and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2772
01:57:57.690 --> 01:58:02.270
<v Speaker 5>high in fiber and you know Broccoli and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit like that to go along with the </v>

2773
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:06.831
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's got this diet that's like a </v>

2774
01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:06.831
<v Speaker 5>cleaner diet and he watches his food.</v>

2775
01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Like the countdown show was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting when we were talking about </v>

2776
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 5>him coming back and they started out </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice and slow.</v>

2777
01:58:11.190 --> 01:58:16.190
<v Speaker 5>He worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made sure his heartbeat heart rate </v>

2778
01:58:16.190 --> 01:58:18.531
<v Speaker 5>didn't go over certain beats per minute </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they slowly built them back so </v>

2779
01:58:18.531 --> 01:58:18.900
<v Speaker 5>they could see the beast return,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2780
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:23.901
<v Speaker 5>And then before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what he's fucking 280 pounds </v>

2781
01:58:23.901 --> 01:58:23.901
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throwing people around.</v>

2782
01:58:23.901 --> 01:58:27.140

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2784
01:58:27.211 --> 01:58:30.570
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if someone actually tattooed a dick</v>

<v Speaker 5>on their chest just like it?</v>

<v Speaker 5>pepper.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want a fucking sausage and pepper.</v>

<v Speaker 5>sauce.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What's this flashlight thing?</v>

2851
02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:03.880
<v Speaker 5>Joey ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2852
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:08.710
<v Speaker 5>the mom totally got to do a word for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking sponsor.</v>

2853
02:01:08.711 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 5>I've been telling you that we're a half </v>
<v Speaker 5>hour character.</v>

2854
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:14.730
<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker stop fucking your </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>

2855
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

2856
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Is the fleshlight a word from our </v>
<v Speaker 5>sponsor?</v>

2857
02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:21.760
<v Speaker 5>We've got to keep the lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2858
02:01:21.761 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 5>The way we do it is run by assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we do is keep the lights on.</v>

2859
02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:27.520
<v Speaker 5>It's soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wonderful.</v>

2860
02:01:27.521 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 5>It feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you leave it out in the sun,</v>

2861
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:31.440
<v Speaker 5>it gets warm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you can.</v>

2862
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can also put it in a tub full of hot</v>

2863
02:01:35.681 --> 02:01:40.681
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good move to fill the tub with </v>

2864
02:01:40.681 --> 02:01:40.681
<v Speaker 5>hot water bath tub with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then</v>

2865
02:01:40.681 --> 02:01:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you squirt some lube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put some lube in there,</v>

2866
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 3>and then you stick your erect penis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll like this.</v>

2867
02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 3>I ain't even thought about doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shower.</v>

2868
02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 3>The only problem with the flashlight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much of a losers.</v>

2869
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:57.050
<v Speaker 3>You feel like when you jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like five times more of a loser</v>

2870
02:01:57.051 --> 02:02:00.920
<v Speaker 3>when you nut into a rubber pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just feel like a fucking idiot,</v>

2871
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's an outstanding product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I'm gonna stop using it,</v>

2872
02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 3>but you do feel completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody caught you beating off,</v>

2873
02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:12.821
<v Speaker 3>that'd be one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you know your girl walks in and </v>

2874
02:02:12.821 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 3>you're like what you're putting into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubber pussy,</v>

2875
02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 3>you're one of the most ridiculous things</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could ever get busted doing.</v>

2876
02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking a rubber posing.</v>

2877
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 3>A real doll would probably be way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2878
02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2879
02:02:23.171 --> 02:02:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that'd be totally way worse.</v>

2880
02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.960
<v Speaker 3>At least this way you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's not a person.</v>

2881
02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm just watching porn have beaten off a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real doll is really kind of fucking </v>

2882
02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:35.621
<v Speaker 3>useless when you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dumb do you have to be to really </v>

2883
02:02:35.621 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 3>think that you were having sex and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would want one just to drive around with</v>

2884
02:02:36.111 --> 02:02:38.050
<v Speaker 3>in the car and do practical jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2885
02:02:38.051 --> 02:02:43.051
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think cops look now because I </v>

2886
02:02:43.051 --> 02:02:43.051
<v Speaker 3>think people have done shit like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2887
02:02:43.051 --> 02:02:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I know people had been busted with masks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff,</v>

2888
02:02:44.091 --> 02:02:46.610
<v Speaker 3>but if you put a fucking seat belt on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sunglasses,</v>

2889
02:02:46.611 --> 02:02:48.590
<v Speaker 3>there's no way that cops gonna know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fake.</v>

2890
02:02:48.591 --> 02:02:50.290
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have tinted windows for short,</v>

2891
02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's nobody's gonna know,</v>

2892
02:02:52.410 --> 02:02:53.000
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>

2893
02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.120
<v Speaker 3>make it look like put a helmet on him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bandages and shit like he's the </v>

2894
02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:58.120
<v Speaker 3>mommy.</v>

2895
02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Like something bad happen to him or like</v>
<v Speaker 3>her outfit.</v>

2896
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:06.410
<v Speaker 3>The cop's going to investigate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the worst criminal of all time.</v>

2897
02:03:06.810 --> 02:03:10.280
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This weekend Joe Diaz is at Sal's comedy</v>

<v Speaker 3>does not have a naval.</v>

2907

<v Speaker 3>that's what we'll do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been needing to do that for a long</v>

2932
02:04:38.101 --> 02:04:43.101
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you need to see joey eventually </v>

<v Speaker 3>But for now,</v>

2934
02:04:43.101 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 3>go to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in La Sal,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Improv 10:00</v>

<v Speaker 3>PM show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to see me House of Blues </v>

2937
02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Night in Vegas Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be the shit,</v>

2938
02:04:57.391 --> 02:04:59.100
<v Speaker 3>the House of Blues and the House of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blues.</v>

2939
02:04:59.101 --> 02:05:04.101
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever seen me there before and </v>

2940
02:05:04.101 --> 02:05:05.481
<v Speaker 3>it was chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We completely revamped the whole </v>

2941
02:05:05.481 --> 02:05:05.481
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2942
02:05:05.481 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 3>There's no more standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After we went to see doug,</v>

2943
02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:11.301
<v Speaker 3>Stan Hope Brian and I went to see Doug </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope and the army went to and it </v>

2944
02:05:11.301 --> 02:05:12.210
<v Speaker 3>was so tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just standing up is awful.</v>

2945
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know.</v>

2946
02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:18.711
<v Speaker 3>Is that hard to watch a show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured it was just like I'm standing </v>

2947
02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:18.711
<v Speaker 3>on stage for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's no big deal.</v>

2948
02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Stand and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a big deal.</v>

2949
02:05:19.831 --> 02:05:24.831
<v Speaker 3>It's annoying as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially because when I'm on stage I </v>

2950
02:05:24.831 --> 02:05:27.181
<v Speaker 3>can walk around and move and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel so made me hate the comedy when </v>

2951
02:05:27.181 --> 02:05:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you're standing and what you had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand in one spot too.</v>

2952
02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:32.630
<v Speaker 3>And I kept like moving my arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretching my backstory,</v>

2953
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 3>not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I decided after that time,</v>

2954
02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 3>no more standing room shows that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>made one mistake.</v>

2955
02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:40.860
<v Speaker 3>We did Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one fucking show in Memphis,</v>

2956
02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:42.420
<v Speaker 3>which was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2957
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:47.440
<v Speaker 3>There was fucking half the show was </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing and it was all a bar and </v>

2958
02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.320
<v Speaker 3>everybody was talking at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their voice and it was,</v>

2959
02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:51.090
<v Speaker 3>there was no other venue available in </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits when we were there.</v>

2960
02:05:51.091 --> 02:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>So we took it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when the,</v>

2961
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:55.740
<v Speaker 3>when we do the house of blues now </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody seated.</v>

2962
02:05:55.980 --> 02:06:00.980
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they had to cut out a few </v>

2963
02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:00.980
<v Speaker 3>hundred tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few hundred seats because they used to</v>

2964
02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:05.720
<v Speaker 3>let people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a few hundred people stand over by </v>

2965
02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:05.720
<v Speaker 3>the bar area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it became a disaster.</v>

2966
02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would talk and they would yell</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out and they would annoy the fuck </v>

2967
02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 3>out of the people that were sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now it's sweet.</v>

2968
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's seated.</v>

2969
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:15.690
<v Speaker 3>So that is a 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Friday.</v>
