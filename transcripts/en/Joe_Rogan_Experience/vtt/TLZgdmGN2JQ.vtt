1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian</v>

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 2>three to do something I like about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you could smoke in here.</v>

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I liked the people can be relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to find a comedy club to shoot our</v>

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:15.944
<v Speaker 2>special word that.</v>

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy cellar.</v>

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>The underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The underground.</v>

7
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>They let you smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.753
<v Speaker 1>but I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a rule where if you're </v>

9
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>a performer you can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a part of your routine that</v>

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you get like a cabaret old still on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>To don't take my word for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I learned that from dice while</v>

12
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>he was onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you read that in the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle manual.</v>

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they can get away with it,</v>

15
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:45.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Dave's always smoking on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't smoke anymore.</v>

18
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you one thing that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>year in between like,</v>

19
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to smoke on stage.</v>

20
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:54.844
<v Speaker 1>That was a tough year because he used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like smoking in the crowd smoke and you </v>

21
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a fun thing.</v>

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>A punchline enhancer to Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do smoke on stage.</v>

23
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like towards the end of it,</v>

24
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we were on the road and we'd do</v>

25
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.484
<v Speaker 1>like an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll pretend he's getting a phone call </v>

26
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go smoke.</v>

27
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Lead me on stage by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

28
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you a chance to like open </v>

29
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>up a long form bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're hearing it,</v>

30
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:21.424
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're really hearing the whole </v>

31
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>story behind the bumping mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you behind the bumping Mike,</v>

32
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>what do you get out of here?</v>

33
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Smoking onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just fulfills the nicotine fix.</v>

34
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Or does it actually give you something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they say,</v>

35
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.963
<v Speaker 2>I've smoked a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked one at Tony Hinchcliffe </v>

36
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:36.424
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes a couple of times before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went onstage and you get like a pick me </v>

37
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little something.</v>

38
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You get an enhancement.</v>

39
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay.</v>

40
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it right now.</v>

41
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It definitely is a weakness that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.053
<v Speaker 1>now I don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything but like coffee and </v>

43
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's breathing for me,</v>

44
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but a onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does focus.</v>

45
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It helps focus you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

46
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.850
<v Speaker 2>said it's legitimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say new nicotine is actually a good</v>

47
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 2>nootropic yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually enhances cognitive function.</v>

48
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do a test without nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do a test with nicotine nonusers.</v>

49
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:09.784
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me nauseous if I accidentally </v>

50
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 2>smoke a blunt and not just straight weed</v>
<v Speaker 2>or tobacco.</v>

51
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Like snoop handed me something the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and I thought it was all pop,</v>

52
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but there was tobacco and those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the shit.</v>

53
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a back and deal with it on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper champion.</v>

54
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Once you get these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were they at this company?</v>

55
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood's for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the stores these days.</v>

56
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 2>These are my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll check them out.</v>

57
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.793
<v Speaker 2>It's a Charlie Murphy got me into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things back in the day because he would </v>

58
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 2>roll them himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would get those swisher sweets and he</v>

59
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 2>would tear them apart and then he put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weed inside of it and roll it out.</v>

60
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:46.314
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old School and then a Chappelle got me </v>

61
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.164
<v Speaker 2>into it again because I smoked one with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him one day at the back of the comedy </v>

62
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:54.281
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

63
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a weird high.</v>

64
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 2>What is the like you get a buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're a little high,</v>

65
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>but you're also</v>

66
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 3>a little bit buzzy from love from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tobacco.</v>

67
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get my fan,</v>

68
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes to make the jokes fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

69
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Whatever they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they made your jacket,</v>

70
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.283
<v Speaker 3>they will smoke a cigarette and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>take like one hit of weed right before </v>

71
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.461
<v Speaker 3>we go on and we meet in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hits good one hip before you've gone</v>

72
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.550
<v Speaker 3>too much before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

73
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in a long,</v>

74
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

75
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like I'd like one more,</v>

76
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 3>but Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dangerous dangerous decision.</v>

77
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to stay a little quick coffee </v>

78
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:36.004
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need coffee before red bull will make </v>

79
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:39.334
<v Speaker 3>me too like jumpy and nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coffee will get my brain work and </v>

80
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit quicker than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audiences.</v>

81
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Did you guys do this one time as a goof </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then start touring with it?</v>

82
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Or did you just put the idea together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

83
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 3>What made you decide to work together </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this?</v>

84
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.323
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all started out just late night at </v>

85
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 4>the comedy cellar where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

86
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.044
<v Speaker 4>I'd be on stage and I would just see </v>
<v Speaker 4>jeff in the room and I would bring them </v>

87
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 4>up and then we would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

88
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 4>like throw down basically and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great time.</v>

89
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.880
<v Speaker 4>And we kept doing it and doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people actually,</v>

90
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they wanted to see it.</v>

91
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 4>It became like this Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you guys going to go up together?</v>

92
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 4>They would always ask us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you guys going up together?</v>

93
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 4>We would get the next mic go,</v>

94
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

95
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:22.430
<v Speaker 3>How it really when I was living in la or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even when I started,</v>

96
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:24.560
<v Speaker 3>but in the last few years I'd come back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to New York.</v>

97
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I have an apartment in Greenwich village</v>
<v Speaker 3>near the comedy cellar and you know,</v>

98
00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 3>it's like cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with knows your name,</v>

99
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:30.854
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you land,</v>

100
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.720
<v Speaker 3>you go sort of go into my empty </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment.</v>

101
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:33.554
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see who's at the seller and get </v>

102
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 3>something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started booking my flights where I</v>

103
00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 3>land around midnight day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When would inevitably have the 1:00</v>

104
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.413
<v Speaker 3>AM spot and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to get my yas out and he </v>

105
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.284
<v Speaker 3>would just bring me up and he'd sit by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the piano and I would goof off or I'd </v>

106
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.483
<v Speaker 3>sit by the piano and he would tell jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we started setting each other up </v>

107
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.923
<v Speaker 3>and it organically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our friends started popping up with us </v>

108
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.923
<v Speaker 3>or people from the audience or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bachelorette party and we just started </v>

109
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.960
<v Speaker 3>making an act out of it without even </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing it.</v>

110
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

111
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.543
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of fun like in the </v>

112
00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 4>beginning especially because it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

113
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really kept me on my toes.</v>

114
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Like listening is like the hardest thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening on stage,</v>

115
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because once you're up there alone,</v>

116
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 4>locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

117
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:20.330
<v Speaker 4>like you control all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like facets of,</v>

118
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:21.164
<v Speaker 4>of the performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when there's another president up </v>

119
00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:24.140
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially jeff and I,</v>

120
00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:24.974
<v Speaker 4>we have so many different skill sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like it was really cool to work off </v>

121
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 4>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A brought up my game a bit.</v>

122
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 4>It definitely made me quicker and faster</v>
<v Speaker 4>and funnier to have to like,</v>

123
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really pretty much roll with it,</v>

124
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

125
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I think that the crowd dug that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a different energy than just</v>

126
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.840
<v Speaker 4>straight up like a showcase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

127
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.083
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that you would do on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast so you wouldn't normally do on </v>

128
00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:47.174
<v Speaker 3>stage which is look at someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me a long time and I think I </v>

129
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.983
<v Speaker 3>could</v>

130
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 4>a million arguments on looking at each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other like sports.</v>

131
00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 4>If you look at you're</v>

132
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 3>never going to not catch that ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're wondering what the other</v>

133
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 3>guy's doing and you're kind of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

134
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:04.034
<v Speaker 3>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like w we connect now and instead </v>

135
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 3>of doing like in tandem one at a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes,</v>

136
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 3>we do jokes together.</v>

137
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That's how like that's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're twins,</v>

138
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>we're twins will do an act and one guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do the setup and the other guys and</v>

139
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>then they do a double punch line to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather.</v>

140
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>We're hoping for that one day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinated.</v>

141
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's one plus one equals </v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

142
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two headliners get together by choice,</v>

143
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 3>not by necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>

144
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>and then Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

145
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.444
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

146
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 3>it took a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave did not want to go to Montreal.</v>

147
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 3>We went up to the comedy festival and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically begged him.</v>

148
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

149
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>do it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.504
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it mostly it's just like a fun </v>

151
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.460
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seller.</v>

152
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just like a cool,</v>

153
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

154
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:50.834
<v Speaker 4>basically like just let it all hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Jeff saw like I guess the next step </v>

155
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:55.094
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

156
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.450
<v Speaker 3>I always just thought it was something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if the comics wanted to see it that</v>

157
00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.284
<v Speaker 3>bad and then more and more comics corner</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come on stage with us and then more </v>

158
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:08.131
<v Speaker 3>and more like Jim Carrey came to one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our big shows in Montreal and,</v>

159
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

160
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.153
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the headlines are sort of </v>

161
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:15.160
<v Speaker 3>popping up with us and I thought Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is more than just us as a hobby.</v>

162
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Like this is something that no one else </v>
<v Speaker 3>is really doing.</v>

163
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got really into it really quick and I </v>

164
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 3>tried to call it clumping mix and Dave </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

165
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:23.554
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

166
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's too on the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good for a title.</v>

167
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.270
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any other structure to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

168
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't rehearse.</v>

169
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.273
<v Speaker 1>He has a flip phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even talk to him before the </v>

170
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:37.750
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any plan.</v>

171
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>What's stressful job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have a flip phone?</v>

172
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stay off the grid.</v>

173
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.123
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw me with a sword in front of the </v>

174
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to go.</v>

175
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to be activated.</v>

176
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

177
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the best</v>

178
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.493
<v Speaker 4>title for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff is really a good producer and all </v>

179
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 4>those different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the same skillsets.</v>

180
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't have like he's produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>producer.</v>

181
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:01.330
<v Speaker 4>He know show busy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those different things.</v>

182
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.040
<v Speaker 4>But like I was like we should have like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really like workshops.</v>

183
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Some other names like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to Castello's looking for an Abbott</v>

184
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Nichols</v>

185
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>and May I</v>

186
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.430
<v Speaker 4>teams out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to say there aren't,</v>

187
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.470
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is that like we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really a team,</v>

188
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.333
<v Speaker 4>like we both have our separate stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when we get together it's like this </v>

189
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 4>kind of like almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

190
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like within 48 hours we're a team again,</v>

191
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only really difficult,</v>

192
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 4>but I think we rock out in certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

193
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.244
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to go through it with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you've done every venue now </v>

194
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 4>you've an outdoor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done theater,</v>

195
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:37.624
<v Speaker 4>you've done casino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are one of the best casino </v>

196
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 4>acts I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

197
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.943
<v Speaker 4>I think we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at a casino we take it to the </v>

198
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 4>level that needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially in a d level casino.</v>

199
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:49.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're like hoping.</v>

200
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

201
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:52.660
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're hoping for like a,</v>

202
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of those electric poker thing </v>

203
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

204
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 1>that kind of the woods yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Fox would we do rock the casinos </v>

205
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:05.470
<v Speaker 1>because I guess they let them smoke my </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

206
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.843
<v Speaker 1>That's true about casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a very body audience and </v>

207
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.394
<v Speaker 1>you can say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to hold back at all and </v>

208
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just fearless.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

370
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Andrew and I are tight and Dave and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>were sort of going back and forth on who</v>

371
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:46.374
<v Speaker 3>could sort of direct us who had no our </v>
<v Speaker 3>moves but yet had the experience and </v>

372
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.470
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like anybody that's too hip.</v>

373
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

374
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.330
<v Speaker 4>I like it straight ahead of Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it straight ahead and I,</v>

375
00:15:57.331 --> 00:16:00.480
<v Speaker 4>and I also think some of these comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>specials or over directed,</v>

376
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.140
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't want to fall into this whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

377
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:04.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of like lighting the stage,</v>

378
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 4>you guys hold lanterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

379
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Know bumped lanterns and then we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

380
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that kind of thing.</v>

381
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

382
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.780
<v Speaker 4>that'll be the essence of the humor that</v>
<v Speaker 4>could happen to.</v>

383
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.860
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

384
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.003
<v Speaker 4>But he really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really was cool and he really was </v>

385
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:21.660
<v Speaker 4>patient and he really brought a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things outside of my wheelhouse.</v>

386
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a collaboration,</v>

387
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.570
<v Speaker 4>which is another thing you're not used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to doing when you do your own special,</v>

388
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.021
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

389
00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:26.441
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

390
00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:27.274
<v Speaker 4>I want to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it this way and I want </v>

391
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 4>it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have other voices in the room and</v>

392
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:32.284
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

393
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.640

394
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to like pretty much mesh </v>

395
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.960
<v Speaker 4>together into something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

396
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.033
<v Speaker 4>pretty much I guess captured the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and also like hopefully the </v>

397
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 4>funding of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

398
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:44.963
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking incredible.</v>

400
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.090
<v Speaker 3>It looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also understood our personalities</v>

401
00:16:51.091 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and our friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

402
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.553
<v Speaker 3>I've been chasing Dave my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always just an open mic or I would go </v>

403
00:16:57.571 --> 00:16:58.970
<v Speaker 3>watch dave or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.813
<v Speaker 3>I always thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if no one's gonna make it in our crew </v>

405
00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:05.100
<v Speaker 3>until Dave makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave was always the one that everybody,</v>

406
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.033
<v Speaker 3>even when Ray Romano was popping on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would call it down to watch Dave </v>

407
00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 3>attell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

408
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.193
<v Speaker 3>riff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first tv spot was a seven hour train </v>

409
00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 3>ride with Dave to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

410
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.310
<v Speaker 3>when we were really young and I've heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>three versions of the story.</v>

411
00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the first version?</v>

412
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

413
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.610
<v Speaker 4>it's like Canada or Syracuse.</v>

414
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.583
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was candidate,</v>

415
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a Hamilton,</v>

416
00:17:32.411 --> 00:17:33.101
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

417
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:34.480
<v Speaker 3>We took a train from the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

418
00:17:34.481 --> 00:17:36.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying Hamilton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called.</v>

419
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that an Ontario?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so,</v>

420
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.070
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I've been.</v>

421
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave is my favorite comic.</v>

422
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that until we really </v>
<v Speaker 4>started working together.</v>

423
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 4>I consider it consider contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird you out and he's like,</v>

424
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.140
<v Speaker 4>you're his favorite comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit and know,</v>

425
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.993
<v Speaker 4>be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

426
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.581
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

427
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see jeff is like beyond unique,</v>

428
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:00.144
<v Speaker 4>like there's nobody like him and what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>does and what he is able to do is </v>

429
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

430
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 4>it's not only fun to watch but it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really like,</v>

431
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a self starter.</v>

432
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 4>He's a self starter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's great to see self starters who</v>

433
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.173
<v Speaker 4>find success because it really is </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to like take something and </v>

434
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 4>like make it not only financially </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful but also like something that,</v>

435
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 4>that we all respect and love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

436
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I'd say the roasting thing that Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 4>really pretty much has rebranded into,</v>

438
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.234
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

440
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 4>every possible way you can do it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>always good because he's behind it,</v>

441
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's not,</v>

442
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 4>when it's not really with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're like,</v>

443
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's other people who are really good</v>

444
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Speaker 4>at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just saying that like,</v>

445
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is when we're on the road and </v>

446
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 4>people will scream out the car door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the roast master.</v>

447
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

448
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I had my insomniac time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he like 20,</v>

449
00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 4>30 times that in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognition.</v>

450
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

451
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.320
<v Speaker 3>We're the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're synonymous with roasts.</v>

452
00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

453
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.890
<v Speaker 3>people say roast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think Jeff Ross,</v>

454
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I earned it because when people laughed </v>
<v Speaker 3>at me and thought,</v>

455
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dead art.</v>

456
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:07.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a lost art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's antiquated.</v>

457
00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:08.600
<v Speaker 3>It's Corny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's old guys.</v>

458
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I stuck by it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

459
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it's alternative comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's doing it.</v>

460
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.023
<v Speaker 3>I get to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to hang with legends like Buddy </v>

461
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Hackett and Milton Berle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

462
00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:21.620
<v Speaker 3>and I stuck to it because it was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

463
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.710
<v Speaker 3>there was a time where I was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed,</v>

464
00:19:24.711 --> 00:19:25.011
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

465
00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be pigeonholed as the roast</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

466
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Were you embarrassed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In my,</v>

467
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if embarrassed is the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

468
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:31.390
<v Speaker 3>but uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

469
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.480
<v Speaker 3>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

470
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I want to be more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was this around?</v>

471
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.930
<v Speaker 3>This was probably 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was in Vegas,</v>

472
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

473
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.240
<v Speaker 3>words of wisdom.</v>

474
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.140
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

475
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.483
<v Speaker 3>that's your lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make that a five lane highway and ride </v>

476
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:48.074
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of what we started when </v>

477
00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:50.294
<v Speaker 3>I started doing sort of really owning it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and loving it and to the credit of the </v>

478
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:57.320
<v Speaker 3>world as we became more pussies in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

479
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Like roasting became more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>potent and important.</v>

480
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the world needs to develop thick </v>

481
00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:07.700
<v Speaker 3>skin and I think roasting honors people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's done with love,</v>

482
00:20:07.701 --> 00:20:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but it also kind of toughens us up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

483
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.673
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's of the time when I came </v>

484
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:14.684
<v Speaker 3>back to the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing I came back to watch was </v>

485
00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:18.260
<v Speaker 3>roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

486
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.020
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't really known I'd heard,</v>

487
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.560
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't really know where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember that night.</v>

488
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.200
<v Speaker 3>I remember that night really well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I remember thinking,</v>

489
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so mean.</v>

490
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.810
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'll be like woke,</v>

491
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 4>you guys go deep,</v>

492
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.100
<v Speaker 3>but really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at the other club,</v>

493
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 3>the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

494
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great tobacco though.</v>

495
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.090
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a real leaf.</v>

496
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 3>The leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can deal with it,</v>

497
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.080
<v Speaker 3>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have any inside.</v>

498
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Is My company going crumble because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

499
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get audited by NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pumped him up.</v>

500
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.140
<v Speaker 3>He went down with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went back up,</v>

501
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Tesla went down and then it went out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really went down six percent.</v>

502
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.903
<v Speaker 3>Then it went up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine studios still smells a little </v>

503
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Muskie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that night when I walked in there,</v>

504
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a joke writing thing.</v>

505
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 3>This isn't just a simple as um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the art of the insult.</v>

506
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

507
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

508
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.373
<v Speaker 3>it's a joke writing and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things I love about roast battle is how </v>

509
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Moses makes everybody hug at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

510
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.183
<v Speaker 3>It's very cool sort of judging it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were pushing each other and </v>

511
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>screaming at each other.</v>

512
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote the rules of roast battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>original material only.</v>

513
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no physical contact.</v>

514
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>

515
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.700
<v Speaker 3>And every battle went to the hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that with them.</v>

516
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Rap battles guys punch each other in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

517
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Rap battles also like the way more mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of roast battle.</v>

518
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking guys I've seen some just </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

519
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.053
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say to each other and Moses like </v>

520
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 3>he owns that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

521
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that circus.</v>

522
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 3>You've got to admire the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can week after week make that work.</v>

523
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so likable.</v>

524
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Like Brian is such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a,</v>

525
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 3>he's such a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good hearted,</v>

526
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 3>sweet person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at the Improv that night.</v>

527
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.383
<v Speaker 3>You hadn't been at the comedy store and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and years and years and years and </v>

528
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:13.234
<v Speaker 3>I don't know all the details and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>never really was part of part of my and </v>

529
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.133
<v Speaker 3>you were asking me about Roche Pat or </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody started asking me about it in </v>

530
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 3>front of you and I saw you getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious and you get more curious and you</v>

531
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>were maybe a little homesick for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>

532
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

533
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go jump in my car and you're like,</v>

534
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:32.554
<v Speaker 3>I'll meet you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you sat up on the balcony where the </v>

535
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 3>judges sit and you hadn't been in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>belly room in five years maybe.</v>

536
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven,</v>

537
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.713
<v Speaker 3>seven years and you're sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses does a double take and he's too </v>

538
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 3>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know what to do.</v>

539
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't really know you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't been back there,</v>

540
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.253
<v Speaker 3>you haven't been in the store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally I say comedy store legend </v>

541
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.383
<v Speaker 3>back after a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say hi to Joe wrote real low key intro </v>

542
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 3>and I've been in that room a lot for </v>
<v Speaker 3>roast battle.</v>

543
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:01.654
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard anything like place </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverberated like I thought we were </v>

544
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 3>going to fall into the main room and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was it.</v>

545
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 3>That was it you even back everyday since</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to go back to.</v>

546
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Because Ari was filming his comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>central specials tonight.</v>

547
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why I had to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Rosebud and I loved him.</v>

548
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.433
<v Speaker 3>I really love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I was going to miss a </v>

549
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like a half to go there.</v>

550
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go there the night of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his special.</v>

551
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Let me just go there a day early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went there a day early and you,</v>

552
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:29.914
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up judging roast battle on </v>

553
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.730
<v Speaker 3>comedy central and Dylan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

554
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.520
<v Speaker 3>you're part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

555
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.393
<v Speaker 3>your royalty over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earl Skakel came out shirtless with a </v>

556
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.943
<v Speaker 3>gold chain with a code on this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the greatest entrances </v>

557
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I've ever anybody take</v>

558
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.240
<v Speaker 2>onstage and he fucking murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on fire on fire.</v>

559
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.863
<v Speaker 3>It's like the art of the insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not be the strongest </v>

560
00:23:57.091 --> 00:23:59.640
<v Speaker 3>headlining act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you can put five jokes together,</v>

561
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you can take somebody down.</v>

562
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.163
<v Speaker 2>But here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that so many people excel at </v>

563
00:24:05.171 --> 00:24:05.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

564
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.543
<v Speaker 2>especially young comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't seem to figure out a way </v>

565
00:24:08.831 --> 00:24:11.740
<v Speaker 2>to generate that kind of energy during a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular set</v>

566
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 4>different?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they don't get stage time.</v>

567
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 4>I think that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that for sure that this</v>

568
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:19.340
<v Speaker 4>is their moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they throw all in.</v>

569
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 4>But can I say as an outsider since I </v>
<v Speaker 4>never was really a west coast,</v>

570
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comic like you guys,</v>

571
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:25.574
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the comedy store from back in </v>

572
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:28.304
<v Speaker 4>the day to before the roast battling to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the roast Batak like an amazing </v>

573
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:33.644
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember walking in there and it was </v>

574
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a haunted house,</v>

575
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:36.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

576
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 4>where is everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

577
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 4>Sam Kennison played here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

578
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 4>and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

579
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 4>you go onstage and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

580
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 4>12 tourists in the room and then a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>of comics in the back.</v>

581
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 4>And then after the rose petal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the energy.</v>

582
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 4>You could just see it just went out like</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the roof of just like it was the</v>

583
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:52.424
<v Speaker 4>place to hang and like it became like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in town you want to go by </v>

584
00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 4>the store and just check it out and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>go on stage and you know,</v>

585
00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.743
<v Speaker 4>the crowds there became way better and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that you were part of that have </v>

586
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.260
<v Speaker 4>really helped reenergizing that club</v>

587
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I felt when I went back,</v>

588
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a different place.</v>

589
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.853
<v Speaker 3>Even Lil rel howery said there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>other comedy competition where other </v>

590
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:15.224
<v Speaker 3>comics come to watch true 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheer on their friends or kind of roll </v>

591
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:20.414
<v Speaker 3>their eyes at the ones that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to win and there's a fraternity </v>

592
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:23.714
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like comedians and I feel like </v>

593
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 3>we're a cult in a weird way sometimes I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like I'm a comedian before I'm even</v>

594
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:30.104
<v Speaker 3>an American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like comedians from all over the world </v>

595
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.583
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like I know them my whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and roast battle is now </v>

596
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.290
<v Speaker 3>international.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

597
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.313
<v Speaker 3>so that's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is a movement like that where </v>

598
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:45.350
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of a corny thing that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 3>really understood the roasting.</v>

599
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.710
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even try out roast jokes when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first started.</v>

600
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.113
<v Speaker 3>It was like so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I would stand there with a piece of </v>

601
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 3>paper and read 10 William Shatner jokes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

602
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.320
<v Speaker 2>You were doing that one night at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Improv.</v>

603
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember who you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing for.</v>

604
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:07.270
<v Speaker 2>People have the same people that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be at the roast.</v>

605
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.543
<v Speaker 2>It'd be dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to put yourself in that roast </v>

606
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.583
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go to see the gross </v>

607
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:14.130
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like going to see a fight.</v>

608
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Say if you went to see a fight and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew you're going to go see a fight,</v>

609
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you can handle the fact that the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on,</v>

610
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.140
<v Speaker 2>but if you just show up at the movies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

611
00:26:22.141 --> 00:26:27.141
<v Speaker 2>start head start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can agree to to horrific shit.</v>

612
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.430
<v Speaker 2>If we just know it's going to take place</v>
<v Speaker 2>in advance</v>

613
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.060
<v Speaker 3>as part of that and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is a sport.</v>

614
00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Roasting has 100 percent of a sport.</v>

615
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.150
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a game because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

616
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not just</v>

617
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.023
<v Speaker 5>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're trying to disarm </v>

618
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:47.994
<v Speaker 5>someone's material towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe like sometimes guys will go at </v>

619
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:56.421
<v Speaker 5>themselves first and then go out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>their opponent like in the same joke,</v>

620
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 5>but they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're already sort of there.</v>

621
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.273
<v Speaker 5>It's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are being clever with because </v>

622
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 5>they've been doing it for a few years </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

623
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 5>so they've seen people bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've seen people murder</v>

624
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.340
<v Speaker 4>other strategies like any other sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you punch back and you have your,</v>

625
00:27:10.341 --> 00:27:11.174
<v Speaker 4>you have your a retort ready and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know there's all kinds of other little </v>

626
00:27:15.201 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

627
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.090
<v Speaker 4>maybe don't mention the obvious thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>till the end and then you're going to.</v>

628
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

629
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.993
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give too many secrets </v>

630
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:26.590
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but better roast battle battlers.</v>

631
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Speaker 4>We'll study the game tape if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and figure all this stuff out.</v>

632
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.300
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five jokes.</v>

633
00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:35.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

634
00:27:35.211 --> 00:27:37.490
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you trip or stumble,</v>

635
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.750
<v Speaker 4>can you recover?</v>

636
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.510
<v Speaker 5>Tony Hinchcliffe that goddamn assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that shit,</v>

637
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.920
<v Speaker 5>that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an assassin at roasts.</v>

638
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.933
<v Speaker 5>He's got an evil little black spot in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his heart and he likes to open up </v>

639
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.390
<v Speaker 5>whenever those roasts come at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those jokes are vicious and clean,</v>

640
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 5>tight.</v>

641
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.610
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've generationally,</v>

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not unfortunately do off the top of</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

647
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.743
<v Speaker 4>That's also the skill of joke writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like in today's world of more </v>

648
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 4>storytelling and all that kind of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's,</v>

649
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.413
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's few and far between where you </v>

650
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:19.224
<v Speaker 4>actually see like someone who can put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together a couple of jokes in a row and </v>

651
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:22.051
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a couple of tags but like to </v>

655
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:30.050

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

656
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.893

<v Speaker 4>about comedy and when he'll tell you </v>

657

<v Speaker 4>like I'll try and um,</v>

659
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically work it out on stage because I</v>

660
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 4>know it's not like one of my own bits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a form bit yet.</v>

661
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like something that I can work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and that's fun too.</v>

662
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:48.504
<v Speaker 4>That also like opened your mind to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole other world of like joke writing </v>

663
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure especially you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right next to another comic.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we started,</v>

665
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.133
<v Speaker 4>we wrote it is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always start by talking about each </v>

666
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They looked like an umpire during a rain</v>

667
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:01.944
<v Speaker 4>delay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually wearing the same stuff </v>

668
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially jeff mixes it up a bit.</v>

669
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>It's easier for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makes a statement.</v>

670
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 4>Let is a very clear David tail outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

671
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 4>it makes a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flip phone.</v>

673
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how to delete a hard drive.</v>

674
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

675
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:23.220

<v Speaker 4>Why do you still didn't answer about the</v>

676
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.780
<v Speaker 4>flip phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have a flip phone?</v>

677
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.733
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the flip phoney like you don't </v>

678
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 4>get distracted with the web because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes forever to get the web on there.</v>

679
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

680
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really like technology.</v>

681
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the web.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

682
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

683
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.183
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the virtual </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and the live experience that </v>

684
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:41.004
<v Speaker 4>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really in that world now of like </v>

685
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 4>coming to see someone live is getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder and harder,</v>

686
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 4>but like they'll know all your clips on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube,</v>

687
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:50.000
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>

688
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I think more people are going to CB </v>
<v Speaker 2>beloved than ever before.</v>

689
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Well Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

690
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 2>If there's any reason for that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely not your,</v>

691
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:01.683
<v Speaker 2>your act because he's got to be content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your lack of connection with the </v>

692
00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:06.034
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are connected more with the </v>

693
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people would be going to see you.</v>

694
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I ever sent,</v>

695

<v Speaker 2>someone there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>met in my life.</v>

703
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 2>You're like some weird fucking Tibetan </v>
<v Speaker 2>monk dude that's been sitting up in some</v>

713
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but why I think I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a correlation.</v>

714
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.690
<v Speaker 2>You're my own self hate more bandwidth </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what you're doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Your stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

716
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.553
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good mixture because you've </v>

717
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:09.514
<v Speaker 2>obviously you've obviously been really </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful with like staying in this </v>

718
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 2>group particularly after you stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and everything.</v>

719
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this tight group present.</v>

720
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.213
<v Speaker 2>That's what I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're sat at the Improv that I saw </v>

721
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 2>was about like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at the Improv together,</v>

722
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.800
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six months.</v>

723
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was funny shit.</v>

724
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.100
<v Speaker 2>But all the fun.</v>

725
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny like when you talk about like</v>

726
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.853
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no harder fan now than your </v>

727
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.120
<v Speaker 4>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like they know comedy,</v>

728
00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:36.954
<v Speaker 4>they know a lot of things and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally respect the art form and like </v>

729
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.650
<v Speaker 4>the craft of it and that's thanks to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're out there doing it.</v>

730
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:44.460
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

731
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.450
<v Speaker 4>it's like back in the day I was a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're out there every night to when you</v>

732
00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:51.480
<v Speaker 4>go on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you're talking from now,</v>

733
00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 4>now from the past and you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How like,</v>

734
00:31:54.361 --> 00:31:55.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

735
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:56.323
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the web,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the web stuff helps and hurts comedy to </v>

736
00:31:59.761 --> 00:32:00.594
<v Speaker 4>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it probably helps more than I'm </v>

737
00:32:02.071 --> 00:32:04.860
<v Speaker 4>giving it credit because it really did </v>
<v Speaker 4>connect to people.</v>

738
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.250
<v Speaker 4>It really did connect with more people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

739
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

740
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.173
<v Speaker 2>think it helps or hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's always been shit comedy </v>

741
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.980
<v Speaker 2>and there's always people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well,</v>

742
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's always been inspiring people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's always been thieves.</v>

743
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.970
<v Speaker 2>There's always been all the bad things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exist now and now it is.</v>

744
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:24.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like way more people can find you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those people.</v>

745
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:24.884
<v Speaker 2>It does translate into clubs and seats </v>
<v Speaker 2>it they do want to come out and the </v>

746
00:32:29.541 --> 00:32:30.374
<v Speaker 2>thing about the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why this works is because we </v>

747
00:32:32.601 --> 00:32:35.900
<v Speaker 2>can all talk about it in a way that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person doesn't do it,</v>

748
00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:38.060
<v Speaker 2>can still understand it and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

749
00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:39.730
<v Speaker 2>there's these guys like this is what</v>

750
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 5>you could be into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

751
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 5>Rebuilding muscle cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing chess,</v>

752
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>into.</v>

753
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 5>When people get really into something is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very similar thing that happens.</v>

754
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.103
<v Speaker 5>Will you get together with other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are also really into it and really </v>

755
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 5>good at it and he'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

756
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:56.260
<v Speaker 5>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always asking like,</v>

757
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 5>do you write it out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you do?</v>

758
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:58.964
<v Speaker 5>Do you just work it out on stage d?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much time do you spend alone with </v>

759
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 5>the bit and how much time do you spend?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much do you love?</v>

760
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Just because a lot of guys don't like to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do anything outside of,</v>

761
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:08.744
<v Speaker 5>right little tiny bullet points and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>let it all express itself naturally on </v>

762
00:33:12.451 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the best guys ever.</v>

763
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.693
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard to say what's right or </v>

764
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong because</v>

765
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of work to comedy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't get which is the writing,</v>

766
00:33:19.381 --> 00:33:23.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the listening to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a taping and listening.</v>

767
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing I have been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not been doing lately.</v>

768
00:33:26.191 --> 00:33:29.340
<v Speaker 4>We worked on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working on other stuff and it's like</v>

769
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.410
<v Speaker 4>data is the thing where when I go back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go like,</v>

770
00:33:31.411 --> 00:33:33.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was really hardcore into the,</v>

771
00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:35.100
<v Speaker 4>into like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

772
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.963
<v Speaker 4>material turning an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the thing where it's like you </v>

773
00:33:38.221 --> 00:33:40.350
<v Speaker 4>almost have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you telling me you have that tank,</v>

774
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.653
<v Speaker 4>that's where like go in there with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>act like especially like a hard show on </v>

775
00:33:43.861 --> 00:33:44.610

776
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.443
<v Speaker 4>late show and like listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to me is like a form of torture to </v>

777
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.180
<v Speaker 4>like all the bits that don't work late </v>
<v Speaker 4>on Friday.</v>

778
00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>

779
00:33:52.351 --> 00:33:55.440
<v Speaker 4>I believe he's very optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very pessimistic.</v>

780
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll.</v>

781
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 4>He really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really is like super optimistic.</v>

782
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late shows.</v>

783
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.550
<v Speaker 4>He loves everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the active audience.</v>

784
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.583
<v Speaker 4>It fuels me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like a lion tamer up there and </v>

785
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:07.794
<v Speaker 4>when Davis beside me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm indestructable what's probably a </v>

786
00:34:10.921 --> 00:34:12.140
<v Speaker 4>really good man.</v>

787
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.020
<v Speaker 5>So for people that don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>quiet to don't want to yell out.</v>

788
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get rowdy and drag people onstage.</v>

789
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.833
<v Speaker 4>We go into the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do all those different things that </v>

790
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

791
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.490
<v Speaker 4>I'll say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say it.</v>

792
00:34:24.491 --> 00:34:25.324
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things that we do are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like old school comedy in terms of like </v>

793
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 4>old school hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's just no longer done.</v>

794
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like you could say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be a little cheesy,</v>

795
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.820
<v Speaker 4>a little this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little of that,</v>

796
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>inappropriate,</v>

797
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 4>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>silly.</v>

798
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Like move to the next bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like remember,</v>

799
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:42.380

<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

800
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you there's like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>punchlines in this thing.</v>

801
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 4>So even if like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

802
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 4>the law of averages like turtle swimming</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the ocean,</v>

803
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:50.323
<v Speaker 4>if only like seven or great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's still a lot for an upper netflix </v>

804
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:53.871
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

805
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 4>honestly I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not patting ourselves on the back,</v>

806
00:34:56.481 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>but that's pretty good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Michelle Wolf.</v>

812

814
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert was,</v>

815
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 4>he completed us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

816
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Like he was the third piece of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ancient,</v>

817
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 4>like scroll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once we found out,</v>

818
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's he been?</v>

819
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you can give us like,</v>

820
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the best one to savage.</v>

821
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's.</v>

822
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 4>What do you think of Gilbert?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if okay,</v>

823
00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:41.544
<v Speaker 4>like your kids or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm trying to think of like if you </v>

824
00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 4>were like 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you think of guilt?</v>

825
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Like he's so out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

826
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.270
<v Speaker 4>like wheelhouse in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>

827
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think he's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's like nobody else.</v>

828
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 6>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I probably thought he was really</v>

829
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 6>funny when I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was 16.</v>

830
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 6>I was really getting into standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No.</v>

831
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 6>My parents took me to see live in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sunset strip when I was 14.</v>

832
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 6>I guess it was a movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I first discovered Gilbert,</v>

833
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 6>he was like on the MTV awards imitating </v>
<v Speaker 6>dice.</v>

834
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.603
<v Speaker 6>So to me he was like not hero comic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was the guy that made fun of the </v>

835
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Speaker 6>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

836
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.270
<v Speaker 6>He had the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

837
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was always like,</v>

838
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 6>people would talk about him in </v>
<v Speaker 6>interview.</v>

839
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 6>So it was always revered by other </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedians.</v>

840
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a guy that's always been like,</v>

841
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 6>he's a wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a legit wild man.</v>

842
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 6>He murdered in our show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like standing.</v>

843
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:32.883
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got a standing o w lately have like </v>

844
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:35.933
<v Speaker 6>friends from our life in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my aunt and his family and like Bruce </v>

845
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 6>Willis is there and he does a bit with </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

846
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:41.994
<v Speaker 6>but I had my friend Craig Moss from high</v>
<v Speaker 6>schools in the audience with his wife </v>

847
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:46.314
<v Speaker 6>and kids and Dave starts walking around </v>
<v Speaker 6>the village underground looking for my </v>

848
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 6>guest list.</v>

849
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.750
<v Speaker 6>Craig Moss,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where's Craig Moss?</v>

850
00:36:52.751 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 6>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they started goofing on,</v>

851
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:56.184
<v Speaker 6>this guy was just in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was a long jump in and go and I </v>

852
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 6>jump in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

853
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:02.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Craig,</v>

854
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:05.070
<v Speaker 6>when my parents died,</v>
<v Speaker 6>craig was my best friend in a new town.</v>

855
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:05.530
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

856
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 6>so I'm explaining to the audience and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dave who this guy is and how much he did</v>

857
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:11.730
<v Speaker 6>for me as a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

858
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.260
<v Speaker 6>and then Gilbert jumps up out of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>audience and just screams,</v>

859
00:37:15.261 --> 00:37:16.740
<v Speaker 6>doesn't even need a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

860
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.630
<v Speaker 6>when my parents were alive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Greg came over and</v>

861
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:26.050
<v Speaker 4>killed them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect timing.</v>

862
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 4>He never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>

863
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.560
<v Speaker 4>He's just his delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an animal.</v>

864
00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:33.320
<v Speaker 4>No filter with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the beauty of him,</v>

865
00:37:33.321 --> 00:37:33.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

866
00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.501
<v Speaker 4>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

867
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:35.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they're going to take.</v>

868
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

869
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.220
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to say three times.</v>

870
00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:42.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids who love comedy would love him,</v>

871
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.460
<v Speaker 4>but I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

872
00:37:45.461 --> 00:37:46.294
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

873
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.793
<v Speaker 4>I would listen to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always like a mix of different types </v>

874
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 4>of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that episode,</v>

875
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.283
<v Speaker 4>Bob Saget and Hassan Minhaj or the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>guests at one point were all up there </v>

876
00:37:57.921 --> 00:37:58.754
<v Speaker 4>together and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are guys who might not even know </v>

877
00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:01.694
<v Speaker 4>each other in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the comedy kind of brings it </v>

878
00:38:03.861 --> 00:38:05.660
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

879
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:08.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like a party mixed with a roast </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed with A.</v>

880
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

881
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.790
<v Speaker 4>it's really cool because Jeff's family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like wherever we would go on the road,</v>

882
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 4>just family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

883
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.880
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I get your comps?</v>

884
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.541
<v Speaker 4>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

885
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:18.374
<v Speaker 4>I've got like three third cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know there were Jews in </v>

886
00:38:20.901 --> 00:38:21.734
<v Speaker 4>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but evidently there were five distinct </v>

887
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.830
<v Speaker 4>23 and me people out there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

888
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.050
<v Speaker 4>it was funny to see because I'm really a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lone wolf,</v>

889
00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:31.520
<v Speaker 4>like I'm on the road alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

890
00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do my thing and jeff really does like,</v>

891
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 4>he's very with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I give him a lot of credit for that.</v>

892
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.243
<v Speaker 4>they're all invited to come hang out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the green room and all that kind of </v>

894
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's cool.</v>

895
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 4>And he brought that on stage with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>aunt.</v>

896
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was like one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments of the whole show.</v>

897
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

898

<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

899
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.610

<v Speaker 3>Nikki Glaser,</v>

901
00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Rachel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a weird mix of.</v>

902
00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:59.663
<v Speaker 3>But you know what for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for just to say one more thing about </v>

903
00:39:01.711 --> 00:39:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Dave and the flip phone and like how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>process works.</v>

904
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Dave is also the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

905

<v Speaker 4>is its own thing,</v>

925
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

926
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that it's always like some guy </v>

927
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:00.580
<v Speaker 4>taping in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

928
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:01.870
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you doing that?</v>

929
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 4>Because this is your experience right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

930
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.500
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

931
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 4>like Stan Hope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is my favorite comic,</v>

932
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.843
<v Speaker 4>Doug Stan hope is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the first guy that like we both </v>

933
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:13.960
<v Speaker 4>talked about like this whole thing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like why do people think that like,</v>

934
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>capturing this show is like important.</v>

935
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

936
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.570
<v Speaker 4>they're also disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like beautiful,</v>

937
00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 4>like fireworks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

938
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:21.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never gonna.</v>

939
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 4>It's never gonna happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that,</v>

940
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you might as well just soak it all in</v>

941
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 4>instead of trying to capture it.</v>

942
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we talk about like topical stuff,</v>

943
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I do that for like as a joke raggedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

944
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:33.454
<v Speaker 4>but also as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping the act alive because I feel </v>

945
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:38.020
<v Speaker 4>like my job in this team is to push it </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward.</v>

946
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.441
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

947
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay Jeff,</v>

948
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 4>what else is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to keep moving it.</v>

949
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can always get into a loop of like,</v>

950
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just putting each other down or like </v>

951
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 4>working the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like to move it forward.</v>

952
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

953
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>the cool thing about that is that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it does,</v>

954
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:55.280
<v Speaker 4>it does move forward to an end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

955
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.183
<v Speaker 5>people are making those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not making those videos to look </v>

956
00:40:58.051 --> 00:41:01.080
<v Speaker 5>back on them to making those videos so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that other people could see it.</v>

957
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the difference between today and the</v>

958
00:41:03.241 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 5>past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you for that or you are against it?</v>

959
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm neither.</v>

960
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.303
<v Speaker 5>I think your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your personal experience is going to be </v>

961
00:41:10.321 --> 00:41:13.830
<v Speaker 5>better if you just watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not,</v>

962
00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:15.020
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you,</v>

963
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.893
<v Speaker 5>maybe you just get more of a jolly off </v>
<v Speaker 5>of filming a clip and putting that clip </v>

964
00:41:19.681 --> 00:41:21.600
<v Speaker 5>on facebook and they're getting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>million downloads.</v>

965
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

966
00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.870
<v Speaker 4>I just know that like when I go to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place and I'm working on new material,</v>

967
00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be figured out and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>then put it on the way I want it.</v>

968
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:29.790
<v Speaker 4>But I totally understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

969
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:30.624
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

970
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.681
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

971
00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:32.730
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

972
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it's an open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an open</v>

973
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 1>world now and it's just like the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling is like an antiquated idea.</v>

974
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>But I think that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as the joke writer,</v>

975
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:42.704
<v Speaker 1>it's like I just want it to where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's going to be and then get it </v>

976
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand?</v>

977
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

978
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 1>if we established an etiquette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and most comedy clubs say you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

980
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

981
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.193
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a bit right now that I'm </v>

982
00:41:58.461 --> 00:41:59.294
<v Speaker 1>working on and I've only done it twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all over the fucking place in </v>

983
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:05.300
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I somehow or another released it,</v>

984
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 1>like if I had to do a Netflix special </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and it had to do that bit,</v>

985
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

986
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:15.521
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This malformed gelatinous preposterous.</v>

987
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working on if a joke yet,</v>

988
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>but sick.</v>

989
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that six months from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's fruit in this.</v>

990
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.293
<v Speaker 1>I know the subject is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to it to figure out </v>

991
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:26.624
<v Speaker 1>what that something is and it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a while and it's going to be a lot </v>

992
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 1>of missteps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

993
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.930
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way for us to do this,</v>

994
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you are a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it feels awesome to practice in</v>

995
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:40.190
<v Speaker 1>front of a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can practice at home.</v>

996
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you can actually get the band </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and play the whole song.</v>

997
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't do that.</v>

998
00:42:44.841 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought that up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people always bring music as like,</v>

999
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like music.</v>

1000
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda not like music,</v>

1001
00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like music at all.</v>

1002
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.320
<v Speaker 1>If anything I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 1>talk about like self hate for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1004
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come like,</v>

1005
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 1>my bits don't rock like within six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1006
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.630
<v Speaker 1>then I started like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like directors and writers and when I,</v>

1008
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.843
<v Speaker 1>everybody has first drafts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has it and like the best </v>

1009
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:11.204
<v Speaker 1>people have multiple drafts and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing with a joke where it's like </v>

1010
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.293
<v Speaker 1>it'll work and then it won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll change a line and then </v>

1011
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 1>it'll work better and they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're feeling it out.</v>

1012
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:19.724
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling out that you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head are filling in the holes that you </v>

1013
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:23.444
<v Speaker 1>only can see because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the creator and I love that </v>

1014
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also is terrifying.</v>

1015
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:29.114
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is like where is it going to </v>

1016
00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically saying,</v>

1017
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:32.264
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's finished now because it got like </v>

1018
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 1>a little laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1019
00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something.</v>

1020
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you have a,</v>

1022
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.040
<v Speaker 6>you have a real issue with this because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they will get a joke,</v>

1023
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.013
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he's the creator and he knows </v>

1024
00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:46.830
<v Speaker 6>where the destroyer are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go ahead.</v>

1025
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.120
<v Speaker 6>But no one is more connected to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then me watching the process,</v>

1026
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.980
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's on tour and doing like,</v>

1027
00:43:53.981 --> 00:43:55.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a week of shows.</v>

1028
00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.403
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know each other's moves and we see </v>

1029
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.270
<v Speaker 6>how it develops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'll finally get a joke,</v>

1030
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 6>not where it's killing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it's like a showstopper,</v>

1031
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.203
<v Speaker 6>like killing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what do we do now where I run </v>

1032
00:44:07.261 --> 00:44:08.094
<v Speaker 6>around a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the jokes hitting so hard that we </v>

1033
00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:12.300
<v Speaker 6>have to do something while there are </v>
<v Speaker 6>laughing,</v>

1034
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take a sip or some will just roll around</v>

1035
00:44:15.151 --> 00:44:19.460
<v Speaker 6>on the floor and I'll destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the next night I'll go,</v>

1036
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.660
<v Speaker 6>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's your workout routine like?</v>

1037
00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:25.530
<v Speaker 6>I'll give him a softball layup to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>like this joke.</v>

1038
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.573
<v Speaker 6>And he'll look at me like I'm speaking </v>
<v Speaker 6>another language because I'm already </v>

1039
00:44:28.771 --> 00:44:31.240
<v Speaker 6>just be like in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you joe.</v>

1040
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm not repeating</v>

1041
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.993
<v Speaker 1>myself night today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll deconstruct and completely </v>

1042
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 1>rearrange the same joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

1043
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I will turn that funny until like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring couch.</v>

1044
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Ikea that joke into a snooze fest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that so the mindset that keeps you</v>

1045
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:47.514
<v Speaker 1>present while bit and keeps him present?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps me like I really am letting </v>

1046
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 1>down the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1047
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:54.961
<v Speaker 1>feed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feed me.</v>

1048
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1049
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1050
00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the full of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also like have a problem with it.</v>

1051
00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 1>If a joke works continuously somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1052
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:06.220
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attacks goes wrong.</v>

1053
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not using your aim material.</v>

1054
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1055
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.353
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1056
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:12.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I think of the jokes is children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave up a lot of my,</v>

1058
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1059
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.600
<v Speaker 1>my first born there or the ugly ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pharmacist joke,</v>

1060
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.473
<v Speaker 1>my homeless joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's so important to have </v>

1061
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 1>that mindset to be a great club comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1062
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Because the show has to be its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1063
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1064
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 1>that keeps you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restart</v>

1065
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.980
<v Speaker 3>for every show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse.</v>

1066
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.843
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse than seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody go over and over and over </v>

1067
00:45:40.431 --> 00:45:41.690
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing every year.</v>

1068
00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:42.920
<v Speaker 3>You see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

1069
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.690
<v Speaker 3>That's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1070
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.840
<v Speaker 3>because it could be so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you like as a person who's a</v>

1071
00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:49.610
<v Speaker 3>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand what they're doing.</v>

1072
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:51.350
<v Speaker 3>They just don't want to take any </v>
<v Speaker 3>chances.</v>

1073
00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 3>But as a person who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1074
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.383
<v Speaker 3>also you know how good it feels to write</v>
<v Speaker 3>something new and eventually get it to </v>

1075
00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:02.210
<v Speaker 3>the point where you could say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gilbert Gilbert live this hilarious,</v>

1076
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1077
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.080
<v Speaker 3>but for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's gotten out of it now,</v>

1078
00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:09.470
<v Speaker 3>but for years he wouldn't update as </v>
<v Speaker 3>material and I took him,</v>

1079
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 3>my sister and my brother in law and John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stamos,</v>

1080
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.750
<v Speaker 3>we all went to see him at Caroline's </v>
<v Speaker 3>when Gilbert's up there.</v>

1081
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's just like three years ago doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Calista flockhart</v>

1082
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.320
<v Speaker 1>can you not even update and we're just</v>

1083
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.383
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way like stainless is </v>

1084
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 3>criticizing him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like whispering in my ear.</v>

1085
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I heard that five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that tenure.</v>

1086
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on Broadway doing Chicago</v>

1087
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 1>30 or 40 50 year old play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1088
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.820
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I defended Gilbert,</v>

1089
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 3>but I did like I did talk to Gilbert and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dara and like,</v>

1090
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.100
<v Speaker 3>like Gilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're too funny to,</v>

1091
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 3>to not evolve like your first hitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>your prime as a comedian.</v>

1092
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:51.970
<v Speaker 3>And now to his credit he's like on </v>
<v Speaker 3>another level he's just,</v>

1093
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:53.283
<v Speaker 3>that's great though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've inspired them to start </v>

1094
00:46:54.221 --> 00:46:55.054
<v Speaker 3>running again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I embarrassed him to start writing </v>

1095
00:46:56.531 --> 00:46:58.120
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking great.</v>

1096
00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

1097
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.710
<v Speaker 1>when he's with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when that thing I said to Jeff,</v>

1098
00:47:01.711 --> 00:47:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we ever tour again,</v>

1099
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.300
<v Speaker 1>we have to bring him on some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cakes because he really does like he was</v>

1100
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.134
<v Speaker 1>the third element of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whatever chemistry of the thing </v>

1101
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:12.564
<v Speaker 1>that really did for me at least I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew that like if it wasn't going </v>

1102
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 1>anything with me and Jeff and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth of it too.</v>

1103
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 1>And people will see that in the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

1104
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:20.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of bits that go </v>

1105
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:22.704
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we left them in to show people that </v>

1106
00:47:23.521 --> 00:47:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it's real and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about getting norm?</v>

1107
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.823
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys do anything with Doris?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish we could do something with norms </v>

1108
00:47:28.571 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1110
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 3>he was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in La.</v>

1111
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:35.910
<v Speaker 3>We were in New York and another dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so God damn,</v>

1112
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I wish you would normally stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying we will,</v>

1113
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 4>but if we ever do this again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this pumping MC state,</v>

1114
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 4>we should get norm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see his tweets,</v>

1115
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 4>his Thanksgiving tweets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1116
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once again,</v>

1117
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 4>on my flip phone friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I retweeted it.</v>

1118
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 4>He's just so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1119
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 4>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about norms,</v>

1120
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 4>just like his ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1121
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this thing about timing.</v>

1122
00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.253
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like there's something about </v>

1123
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:02.700
<v Speaker 4>that timing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1124
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 4>I know in today's world that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't care about that.</v>

1125
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 4>It's more about identity and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

1126
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but like norm is a master of timing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really is like a master of timing and</v>

1127
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing that he's trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>is finding these classic jokes.</v>

1128
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1129
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 4>he's genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1130
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.250
<v Speaker 4>he's one of the road gigging</v>

1131
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.750
<v Speaker 3>opening for norm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really probably road gig ever.</v>

1132
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 91.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1133
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:33.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm a catch Princeton somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked my way into an MC spot and rich</v>

1134
00:48:34.071 --> 00:48:39.071
<v Speaker 3>vos was the middle and norm was normally</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally the only famous for doing a few</v>

1135
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 3>late night shows whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't Letterman at the time.</v>

1136
00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:44.350
<v Speaker 3>What was the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1137
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 3>was it thick of the night or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Bob Costas?</v>

1138
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1139
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 3>it was a leader with Bob costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't as cool as that.</v>

1140
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:52.594
<v Speaker 3>Even bill boggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was going to give you some some show </v>

1141
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 3>you'll remember in a few minutes and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1142
00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like syndicated whatever it was,</v>

1143
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.753
<v Speaker 3>but like I meet norm and he's catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>prints them and he'd do an hour to 45 </v>

1144
00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:12.871
<v Speaker 3>minutes every show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He either destroyed or he got zero lasts</v>

1145
00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:15.670
<v Speaker 3>for 45 minutes and whenever he got zero </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh,</v>

1146
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 3>he would stand by the door and say </v>
<v Speaker 3>goodbye to people as they left.</v>

1147
00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1148
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:22.564
<v Speaker 3>And if he killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would go back up to the room with </v>

1149
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Boston and we would play poker like he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1150
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:31.830
<v Speaker 3>He was still up for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then while we were there last,</v>

1151
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 3>he got booked on Letterman for the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I had a jeep.</v>

1152
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.123
<v Speaker 3>My sister bought me a jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the money she got from a car </v>

1153
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 3>accident and I drove to norm the best.</v>

1154
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.113
<v Speaker 3>And I drove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove norm to his letter taping his </v>

1155
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 3>first letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1156
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot that week.</v>

1157
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:53.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what a great guy to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first guy opened for them.</v>

1158
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 3>It was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1159
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Todd Barry was so obsessed with norm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came out and flipped on my bed.</v>

1160
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.870
<v Speaker 3>First Guy I ever opened for was a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>named Warren.</v>

1161
00:50:04.871 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's is really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like old school veteran Boston comic,</v>

1162
00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>but the second guy opened for was Lenny </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clarke.</v>

1163
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.333

<v Speaker 3>totally contrary to his brother's </v>

<v Speaker 3>nicest guy.</v>

1166

<v Speaker 3>I love Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He helped me.</v>

1167
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking awesome.</v>

1169

<v Speaker 2>but you're too fucking dirty.</v>

1176
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 2>and then Lenny Clarke came off stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1177

<v Speaker 2>don't clean your act up until them kid.</v>

1178
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 2>He gave me great advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's strong.</v>

1179
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Those two guys than Isis there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Boston too.</v>

1180
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 2>When I was going to be used into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>core and when I.</v>

1181
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.260
<v Speaker 2>When I was preparing a roast of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston cops and Mike really helped me,</v>

1182
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:04.814
<v Speaker 2>like warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got me a bunch of local gigs in the </v>

1183
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Boston flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh beautiful.</v>

1184
00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:11.120
<v Speaker 2>For the Irish people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian people,</v>

1185
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a good place to do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1186
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 4>That is definitely of the two towns I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking right now.</v>

1187
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:18.800
<v Speaker 4>Boston and Philly are the two towns that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have changed dramatically.</v>

1188
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 4>Comedically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also just in terms of like,</v>

1189
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 4>like when you walk around in Boston now </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not like,</v>

1190
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get jumped,</v>

1191
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm wearing a Yankee,</v>

1192
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anything it's like,</v>

1193
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:30.884
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody here is so like metro and you </v>

1194
00:51:32.971 --> 00:51:33.804
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's gonna invite me to like a </v>

1195
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 4>poetry reading at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a wine bar or something like that.</v>

1196
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 4>It's very metro and the comedy there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>still good,</v>

1197
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that old Boston was such a challenge.</v>

1198
00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:44.990
<v Speaker 4>It really was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the outsiders.</v>

1199
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 4>What year did you start going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into next?</v>

1200
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.590
<v Speaker 4>In their nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1201
00:51:49.591 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 4>and every time it dreaded it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1202
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 4>they really were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1203
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 4>they were battles every time</v>

1204
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 2>and they had local headliners that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy you.</v>

1205
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:59.750
<v Speaker 2>The greatest comics ever offstage.</v>

1206
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.860
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was definitely one of those things.</v>

1207
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.110
<v Speaker 4>You were terrified what you would hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

1208
00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:05.041
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1209
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:08.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Giana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to tell you about.</v>

1210
00:52:08.221 --> 00:52:13.221
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gavin might come down like he just wants</v>

1211
00:52:13.231 --> 00:52:14.700
<v Speaker 4>to do a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.130
<v Speaker 4>They would go on stage just to fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1213
00:52:17.131 --> 00:52:18.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1214
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1215
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.380
<v Speaker 4>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's still like that for</v>

1216
00:52:22.381 --> 00:52:24.600
<v Speaker 4>people starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but comics were me,</v>

1217
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:26.370
<v Speaker 4>but that was their town and they and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1218
00:52:26.371 --> 00:52:29.430
<v Speaker 4>and they saw you coming into their town </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were like,</v>

1219
00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:30.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better,</v>

1220
00:52:30.061 --> 00:52:31.170
<v Speaker 4>you better prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1221
00:52:31.171 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 4>it's like before step up revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a,</v>

1222
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you had to own and never hold grudges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why.</v>

1223
00:52:37.111 --> 00:52:39.420
<v Speaker 4>I'd never people who were Douchey to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the beginning,</v>

1224
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1225
00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:41.580
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't ready for your response.</v>

1226
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll learn it eventually.</v>

1227
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:46.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a great attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Hackett to that,</v>

1228
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.813
<v Speaker 2>to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1229
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 2>when you're holding a grudge together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys out dancing,</v>

1230
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a great piece of waste energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1231
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.790
<v Speaker 2>there was a horrible Hackett though </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1232
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.480
<v Speaker 2>What was going on back then was a famine</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality and I don't think we have that</v>

1233
00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:04.314
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that famine mentality is gone </v>

1234
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.660
<v Speaker 2>because now everybody realizes that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet there's,</v>

1235
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:10.933
<v Speaker 2>there's literally an unlimited amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers and people that could come to </v>

1236
00:53:15.181 --> 00:53:20.181
<v Speaker 2>your gigs and it's way more beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to know that you,</v>

1237
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:24.270
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good for them to know,</v>

1238
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>you have good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1239
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.671
<v Speaker 5>if Dave says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1240
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:27.504
<v Speaker 5>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See Jeff Ross is fucking hilarious </v>

1241
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 5>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

1242
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love Dave,</v>

1243
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 5>so he must be right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1244
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1245
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 5>this is the not having a famine </v>
<v Speaker 5>mentality.</v>

1246
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing that fucked us back in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the early days,</v>

1247
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:42.654
<v Speaker 5>like in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was before my time because when I </v>

1248
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:46.620
<v Speaker 5>came along,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had already started.</v>

1249
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.010
<v Speaker 5>Steven Wright had been on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was he on Letterman?</v>

1250
00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 5>Jay Leno had already taken off and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was on Letterman all the time.</v>

1251
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 5>Those guys had already broken through to</v>
<v Speaker 5>tv,</v>

1252
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 5>but there was a sense that some of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>had that like,</v>

1253
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:01.290
<v Speaker 5>where's mine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1254
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:02.720
<v Speaker 5>how come I didn't salute?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1255
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.583
<v Speaker 5>there was a tiny amount of slots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like Steven Wright couldn't go </v>

1256
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:07.080
<v Speaker 5>on Letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'd say,</v>

1257
00:54:07.081 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think I'm funny?</v>

1258
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.330
<v Speaker 5>You got to see this Guy Lenny Clarke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you gotta.</v>

1259
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 5>See this Guy Don Gavin are you got to </v>
<v Speaker 5>see Steve Sweeney.</v>

1260
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 5>All these murders that he came up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were all like,</v>

1261
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:18.890
<v Speaker 5>where's mine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1262
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:19.883
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck</v>

1263
00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:23.900
<v Speaker 4>you just like in my head to have too few</v>
<v Speaker 4>spots,</v>

1264
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:28.320
<v Speaker 4>but also like we're of the generation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not to make this like a whole</v>

1265
00:54:28.321 --> 00:54:29.960
<v Speaker 4>like trip to the museum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a comedy,</v>

1266
00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:34.730
<v Speaker 4>but we're of the generation where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually saw people who crush a room,</v>

1267
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.110
<v Speaker 4>like crush room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like today.</v>

1268
00:54:36.111 --> 00:54:36.531
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1269
00:54:36.531 --> 00:54:37.400
<v Speaker 4>you killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You crushed it.</v>

1270
00:54:37.401 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 4>But like seeing Richard Jenny at his </v>
<v Speaker 4>height,</v>

1271
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:41.560
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey caroline's,</v>

1272
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.370
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crushed that room.</v>

1273
00:54:43.371 --> 00:54:46.990
<v Speaker 4>People leaving exhausted where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>two hours in.</v>

1274
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.781
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1275
00:54:47.781 --> 00:54:50.720
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't even hit his this thing yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

1276
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:51.860
<v Speaker 4>he'll get off the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1277
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.120
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you think of that tag?</v>

1278
00:54:53.121 --> 00:54:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which?</v>

1279
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:54.441
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1280
00:54:54.441 --> 00:54:56.570
<v Speaker 4>you like throw like a million jokes up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1281
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I would watch that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1282
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.870
<v Speaker 4>that's terrifying to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like watching a wave come at you,</v>

1283
00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:06.200
<v Speaker 4>and it was like what people consider now</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing a room or crushing a room.</v>

1284
00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Like I never got to see Sam Kennison or </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of those people live,</v>

1285
00:55:09.261 --> 00:55:12.200
<v Speaker 4>but I assume that was the same thing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>where people could not breed.</v>

1286
00:55:12.201 --> 00:55:13.940
<v Speaker 4>They leave the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just going like,</v>

1287
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like exhausted.</v>

1288
00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.213
<v Speaker 5>I got to see Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't get to see him until after </v>

1289
00:55:18.051 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 5>he released his HBO special and after he</v>
<v Speaker 5>released his hbo special,</v>

1290
00:55:21.711 --> 00:55:22.544
<v Speaker 5>all that material was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what I would've wanted to see was </v>

1291
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:25.903
<v Speaker 5>that because that was like a culmination</v>
<v Speaker 5>of 10 years of doing standup and then </v>

1292
00:55:29.361 --> 00:55:31.280
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does that hbo special and it's just,</v>

1293
00:55:31.281 --> 00:55:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm a murderous nuclear missile that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I saw him after that.</v>

1294
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.863
<v Speaker 5>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did the HBO because I wonder what </v>

1295
00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 5>year when I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was either 85 or 86.</v>

1296
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.580
<v Speaker 5>I think it was 86,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so five plummet.</v>

1297
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Rascal for the sold out show and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>in college and I knew how funny he was.</v>

1298
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:53.540
<v Speaker 5>He was probably already famous old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was He at rascals?</v>

1299
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:55.210
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't be doing a bigger venue by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guests.</v>

1300
00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.053
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I remember it felt like a </v>

1301
00:55:57.081 --> 00:55:57.950
<v Speaker 5>special event.</v>

1302
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I saw him at theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw him at a couple of big places.</v>

1303
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Speaker 5>I saw him at one place down the Cape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1304
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.790
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was like if I had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guest today,</v>

1305
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:12.350
<v Speaker 5>I would say somewhere around 2000 seats </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I saw him at great woods,</v>

1306
00:56:12.351 --> 00:56:13.184
<v Speaker 5>which is considerably larger than that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's right after his hbo special </v>

1307
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:20.150
<v Speaker 5>and this is 80.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is 86.</v>

1308
00:56:20.151 --> 00:56:21.380
<v Speaker 5>80 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1309
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.250

<v Speaker 5>Did you shut the fuck up?</v>

1310
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:25.990

1318
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.613
<v Speaker 5>I was reluctant security guard because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>would always bring a Hoodie with me and </v>

1319
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:51.844
<v Speaker 5>if shit went down I'd cover up my </v>
<v Speaker 5>security jacket and get the fuck out of </v>

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I just walked straight to my car and </v>
<v Speaker 5>drove the fuck home.</v>

1349
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:21.970
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize paycheck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm out.</v>

1351
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:24.843
<v Speaker 5>Full blown riot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two dudes were throwing down and piles </v>

1352
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:29.560
<v Speaker 5>of people beating the shit out of each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1353
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 5>There was fires,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they canceled the concert,</v>

1354
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:34.180
<v Speaker 5>they shut the concert in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening for Nila.</v>

1355
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.790
<v Speaker 5>Who is the opener?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the problem.</v>

1356
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:37.624
<v Speaker 5>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1357
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:38.523
<v Speaker 5>there was two problems sometimes when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you were in the back area where the </v>

1358
00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:43.780
<v Speaker 5>grass was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the acoustics weren't so good.</v>

1359
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 5>So like when people went to see comics </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was bad.</v>

1360
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they fixed the sound,</v>

1361
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:50.734
<v Speaker 5>but back then it was a big issue you had</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside the canopy to hear what the fuck </v>

1362
00:58:54.581 --> 00:58:55.830
<v Speaker 5>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think</v>

1363
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 4>a odd ball in like outdoor comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think of that?</v>

1364
00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 5>I've done some outdoor things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a big outdoor place in Kansas City</v>

1365
00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:05.530
<v Speaker 5>this year and it was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really an awesome.</v>

1366
00:59:05.531 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was a summer night,</v>

1367
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was beautiful.</v>

1368
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.720
<v Speaker 5>We got lucky with the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no rain or anything</v>

1369
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.540
<v Speaker 4>when Jeff and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1370
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:14.040
<v Speaker 4>the odd ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we went on together.</v>

1371
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:14.993
<v Speaker 4>That was my most fun doing the odd ball </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and I always thought it was a </v>

1372
00:59:16.441 --> 00:59:19.050
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like jeff was a super cool to comics and</v>

1373
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 4>everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the only guy I've ever seen,</v>

1374
00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 4>like actually looked like he's having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great time with Chappelle doing it.</v>

1375
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Like I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so comfortable everywhere.</v>

1376
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 4>But like in the outdoor venue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1377
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 4>he's taking his time and there's a club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1378
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1379
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 4>it's just amazing to watch them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the outdoor thing with the kid never</v>

1380
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.290
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.710
<v Speaker 4>like the joke going off into outer </v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

1382
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 4>That definitely is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1383
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 4>is something that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1384
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.870
<v Speaker 4>even the theater in the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one I saw Rodney Dangerfield,</v>

1385
00:59:45.871 --> 00:59:48.890
<v Speaker 4>they when I was like 17 and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>another situation where this guy is just</v>

1386
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 4>like crushing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crushing,</v>

1387
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 4>crushing and the room cannot breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

1388
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't in the round,</v>

1389
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:55.671
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1390
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:56.451
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

1391
00:59:56.451 --> 00:59:57.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 17.</v>

1392
00:59:57.201 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1393
00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.840
<v Speaker 4>is this how it goes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1394
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is he circling around like that?</v>

1395
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that part of it?</v>

1396
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.653
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't understand that it was in the </v>

1397
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:04.454
<v Speaker 4>round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1398
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:05.383
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I realize that that's another </v>

1399
01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 4>like really hard venue to play is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>round,</v>

1400
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1401
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only done a few of those.</v>

1402
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.111
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did the,</v>

1403
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that place in Phoenix.</v>

1404
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 5>That one's in the round Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 5>theater.</v>

1405
01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.020
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great.</v>

1406
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:17.953
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that you did one of his hps was </v>

1407
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 5>there and because George Carlin did one </v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1408
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 5>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1409
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 5>He did so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I did them everywhere.</v>

1410
01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean every year that is bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the craziest places ever.</v>

1411
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 5>And talk about someone who did it </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally differently.</v>

1412
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:35.410
<v Speaker 5>He would basically write a monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1413
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.130
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1414
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:37.580
<v Speaker 5>take us out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>work at it at all,</v>

1415
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.130
<v Speaker 5>not working out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of tightened it up on stage.</v>

1416
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 5>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1417
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:41.743
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bits as you would just keep doing </v>

1418
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 5>them and figure out a better way to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1419
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 5>but write it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>write the whole thing.</v>

1420
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:48.134
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

1421
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he did it every year.</v>

1422
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.043
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1423
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.700
<v Speaker 4>That was like at the height of that hbo </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy thing,</v>

1424
01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:55.480
<v Speaker 4>you'd like tune in specific just to see</v>

1425
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.543
<v Speaker 5>national.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well he was in a different place than </v>

1426
01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:03.070
<v Speaker 5>anybody else because of how prolific he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was and some some would say like,</v>

1427
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.193
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some of it wasn't my favorite stuff </v>

1428
01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:06.714
<v Speaker 5>and like listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is impossible to write an hour every </v>

1429
01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:13.800
<v Speaker 5>fucking year and have it your best </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of that hour.</v>

1430
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.280
<v Speaker 5>You need more time a lot of the times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he had an honor.</v>

1431
01:01:17.281 --> 01:01:19.380
<v Speaker 5>That commitment of getting the special </v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1432
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.243
<v Speaker 5>but what he did was he did something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was slightly different than comedy </v>

1433
01:01:23.461 --> 01:01:26.910
<v Speaker 5>either because it was even because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like a lot of it was like a state of</v>

1434
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.840
<v Speaker 5>the union,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a state of civilization.</v>

1435
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:34.841
<v Speaker 5>The state wasn't just comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like here's a really wise old guy.</v>

1436
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.413
<v Speaker 5>He was super smart but he has some </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good points and he's going to do </v>

1437
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 5>this every year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was,</v>

1438
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.060
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was different.</v>

1439
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.520
<v Speaker 5>It was more that it wasn't like he never</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked out in clubs.</v>

1440
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.453
<v Speaker 5>Like I went to see him once and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had this whole bit about fuck </v>

1441
01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:50.640
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like basically fuck this and fuck</v>

1442
01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:52.950
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and part of it was comedy clubs.</v>

1443
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.060
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>

1444
01:01:54.061 --> 01:01:54.960
<v Speaker 5>George,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to work out.</v>

1445
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.090
<v Speaker 5>You're shitting comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fuck comedy clubs.</v>

1446
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.953
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1447
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.460
<v Speaker 5>I saw him years later the store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was just fucking around.</v>

1448
01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.013

<v Speaker 5>I was at the Improv back in the day and </v>

1449
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I was probably going on at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM and I still have it.</v>

1450
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.940
<v Speaker 5>It was a schedule that had George Carlin</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on 30 for like five hours later.</v>

1451
01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:18.900
<v Speaker 5>I went onto the prom show or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Carlin came into the Improv.</v>

<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1483
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many fucking people,</v>

1484

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>he did a lot of that back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the uh,</v>

1487
01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 2>pain pills was later on in his life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just said,</v>

1488
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>reached a point where he realized I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got an issue.</v>

1489
01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I've got to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

1490
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.313
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect that he really committed to </v>

1491
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:32.974
<v Speaker 2>his craft and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was trying to do other stuff </v>

1492
01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>here and there because he did a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting things,</v>

1493
01:03:37.931 --> 01:03:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but that was not his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His thing was hbo specials every year.</v>

1494
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.560

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1495
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.310
<v Speaker 2>no one else was doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You figure out what your thing is.</v>

1496
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Lucky happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>having a brilliant social point with </v>
<v Speaker 2>humor attached to it.</v>

1499
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.353
<v Speaker 2>That was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of his best bits were just </v>

1500
01:03:58.031 --> 01:03:58.864
<v Speaker 2>like really good points about hypocrisy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the ridiculousness of our </v>

1501
01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>civilization with like really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchline.</v>

1502
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>He would write to a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that too.</v>

1503
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 4>He also like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like the first guy to really like</v>

1504
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.170
<v Speaker 4>him and Bill Hicks I always thought were</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1505
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was so cool.</v>

1506
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Their takes on religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1507
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1508
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:19.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lenny Bruce obviously opened that door </v>

1509
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.953
<v Speaker 2>that opened the door and it was a pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ass to get used to Tommy about </v>

1510
01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:28.300
<v Speaker 2>lenny bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just a pain in the ass.</v>

1511
01:04:28.301 --> 01:04:30.220
<v Speaker 2>They got everybody in trouble all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1512
01:04:30.221 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 2>There'd be cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy clubs and Shit.</v>

1513
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't be that guy unless you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain in the ass.</v>

1514
01:04:36.011 --> 01:04:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was arrested multiple times.</v>

1515
01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:41.240
<v Speaker 2>So what do we have that bad words like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

1516
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1517
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:43.363
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we need a guy like him in </v>

1518
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>a sentence like crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult guy if you live today,</v>

1519
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1520
01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he was alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just be a great comic.</v>

1521
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.990
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have to do all the shit that</v>

1522
01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>he had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was,</v>

1523
01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for us to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you go back and listen to stuff</v>

1524
01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:05.500
<v Speaker 2>like lenny bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really almost impossible unless you</v>

1525
01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>live through it that time yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time to put it.</v>

1526
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.350
<v Speaker 2>That's why like I can kind of put myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the eighties.</v>

1527
01:05:11.351 --> 01:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of remember vaguely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sense of what it was like.</v>

1528
01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have goddamn clue as</v>

1529
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 5>to what it was like in the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so when he was doing this,</v>

1530
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 5>we have to put it in context that there </v>
<v Speaker 5>was no,</v>

1531
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 5>there was no freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't say certain words,</v>

1532
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.783
<v Speaker 5>I mean really crazy restrictions on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way people talked and they brought him </v>

1534
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 5>into court over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially bankrupt them.</v>

1535
01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.013
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't work anymore and by the end </v>
<v Speaker 5>he just died of heroin on the fucking </v>

1536
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:42.994
<v Speaker 5>bathroom floor and then he became a mess</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of him bms was him dealing </v>

1537
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:48.064
<v Speaker 5>with his court cases like he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's recordings of him where he's </v>

1538
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:50.974
<v Speaker 5>going on stage with his legal papers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just reading the diversity of the </v>

1539
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He lost his fucking mind,</v>

1540
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.180
<v Speaker 4>but we also came up in a club system and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I consider myself a club comic.</v>

1541
01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm supposed to do.</v>

1542
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.260
<v Speaker 4>But like these guys were before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you say,</v>

1543
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.750
<v Speaker 4>Hackett and all these guys way before </v>
<v Speaker 4>the club system,</v>

1544
01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:08.510
<v Speaker 4>they played the catskills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They played some,</v>

1545
01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Jewish camp somewhere,</v>

1546
01:06:10.431 --> 01:06:11.264
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did that kind of thing that was </v>

1547
01:06:11.931 --> 01:06:12.764
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like proving ground and I'm sure that </v>

1548
01:06:13.731 --> 01:06:17.600
<v Speaker 4>was probably the hardest of the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigs to do.</v>

1549
01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:18.434
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1550
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.210
<v Speaker 4>it's an all ages show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1551
01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:21.044
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there may be a late show where they get </v>

1552
01:06:22.161 --> 01:06:23.730
<v Speaker 4>to be a little saucier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1553
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.630
<v Speaker 4>it really is a tough thing and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same crowd for a whole week.</v>

1554
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1555
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.090
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:06:29.091 --> 01:06:29.924
<v Speaker 4>So like I give it up to those guys like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joan rivers who I think also is like an </v>

1557
01:06:32.841 --> 01:06:35.030
<v Speaker 4>unsung hero comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she,</v>

1558
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:36.523
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crosses over that thing from like TV </v>

1559
01:06:39.711 --> 01:06:44.030
<v Speaker 4>comedies becomes like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where you see them on like a Johnny</v>

1560

<v Speaker 4>Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1561
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Like I love her sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched them one.</v>

1562
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she really was a great joke writer.</v>

1563
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.830
<v Speaker 4>She was really young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Savage</v>

1564
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.360
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd go after it.</v>

1565
01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.253
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who else stayed relevant and they're at </v>

1566
01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:55.740
<v Speaker 3>80 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who else had new material at 80?</v>

1567
01:06:55.741 --> 01:06:58.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really just those two.</v>

1568
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Just Carlin and her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so,</v>

1569
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:01.223
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1570
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.273
<v Speaker 3>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she died trying to improve her </v>

1571
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.400
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her instrument,</v>

1572
01:07:05.401 --> 01:07:08.820
<v Speaker 3>like she was still staying in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sad one.</v>

1573
01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I was at her funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a really amazing.</v>

1574
01:07:11.191 --> 01:07:14.190
<v Speaker 3>It was like a king died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the greatest.</v>

1575
01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:15.083
<v Speaker 3>She had some serious fucking horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it came to like her ability to </v>

1576
01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:23.190
<v Speaker 3>deliver punchlines and one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>books I ever read.</v>

1577
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.053
<v Speaker 3>Young comics out there read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enter talking by Joan rivers about her </v>

1578
01:07:27.151 --> 01:07:27.984
<v Speaker 3>early days in stand up and acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really don't read ladies and </v>

1579
01:07:31.651 --> 01:07:35.760
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Bruce will start putting foil over</v>

1580
01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:38.400
<v Speaker 3>your windows and shooting up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1581
01:07:38.401 --> 01:07:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did read that.</v>

1582
01:07:39.781 --> 01:07:40.614
<v Speaker 3>It's a great book.</v>

1583
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.523
<v Speaker 3>So I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a comedy class in New York who </v>

1584
01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.410
<v Speaker 3>was teaching Lee Frank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy of mine.</v>

1585
01:07:46.411 --> 01:07:47.244
<v Speaker 3>He's asking his writing and I was fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>loser living in New Jersey with my </v>

1586
01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.880
<v Speaker 3>grandfather and my buddy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1587
01:07:53.881 --> 01:07:56.070
<v Speaker 3>take this comedy class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be good at it.</v>

1588
01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1589
01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:58.051
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1590
01:07:58.051 --> 01:07:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

1591
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.593
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's near the bus station where I would </v>

1592
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.513
<v Speaker 3>go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then go visit my grandpa and take </v>

1593
01:08:04.231 --> 01:08:05.064
<v Speaker 3>care of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was sick and and I would just go to </v>

1594
01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:11.190
<v Speaker 3>this class for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a way to socialize really.</v>

1595
01:08:11.191 --> 01:08:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a desired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what stand up was,</v>

1596
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.913
<v Speaker 3>but the first assignment was to memorize</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comedian's act and do it just for the </v>

1597
01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:21.464
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to get a sense of timing and what </v>

1598
01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:23.534
<v Speaker 3>it was like.</v>

1599
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.930
<v Speaker 3>We understood it wasn't our material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't about that at all.</v>

1600
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard Lenny Bruce was the coolest.</v>

1601
01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 3>So I went to the springfield public </v>
<v Speaker 3>library.</v>

1602
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I took out a lenny bruce that live at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carnegie Hall Double Album.</v>

1603
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:35.744
<v Speaker 3>I still have it and I remember I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this routine and I didn't get it the </v>

1604
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 3>that the class didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realized like God,</v>

1605
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:46.580
<v Speaker 3>context is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't make.</v>

1606
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't hold up at all.</v>

1607
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It made almost no sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I realized that it really is,</v>

1608
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:55.340
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

1609
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 3>like the moment the tide isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of being there.</v>

1610
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.863
<v Speaker 5>People were so restricted back then in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of their access to information in </v>

1611
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 5>terms of the way they talk to each other</v>
<v Speaker 5>that anything outside of the norm,</v>

1612
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.813
<v Speaker 5>anything being broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we have to also remember that </v>

1613
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:12.390
<v Speaker 5>broadcasting itself was only like 40 or </v>
<v Speaker 5>50 years old,</v>

1614
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 5>so this is a fairly new medium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1615
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.153
<v Speaker 5>and anything that was even remotely just</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of what the ics excepted </v>

1616
01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:24.524
<v Speaker 5>standard operating were behaving was was</v>
<v Speaker 5>considered decadent and racy enlists </v>

1617
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.300
<v Speaker 5>dirty lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would.</v>

1618
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 5>He would talk about things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not supposed to talk about that.</v>

1619
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the taboo subjects,</v>

1620
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.170
<v Speaker 5>but today that same stuff has already </v>
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>

1621
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:41.870
<v Speaker 5>He opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Richard Pryor kicked it down,</v>

1622
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.853
<v Speaker 5>lit it on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Murphy nuclear bombed it and then </v>

1623
01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:47.900
<v Speaker 5>it kept going on Kennison and Hicks and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's those.</v>

1624
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.943
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no shame in any of these </v>

1625
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 5>subjects anymore.</v>

1626
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no built in weirdness to it that</v>

1627
01:09:54.741 --> 01:09:55.574
<v Speaker 5>he experienced back then and he would've</v>
<v Speaker 5>never been able to do comedy any </v>

1628
01:09:58.851 --> 01:09:59.684
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's also what we need to </v>

1629
01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:01.514
<v Speaker 5>understand as if like Eddie Murphy went </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to 1960 and did his same kind of </v>

1630
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 5>material that he did in Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't take,</v>

1631
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody would be like,</v>

1632
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 5>he's yelling at us like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>

1633
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.413
<v Speaker 5>This is not comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they wouldn't be ready for it </v>

1634
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:19.010
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's these stages that have to happen</v>

1635
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.053
<v Speaker 5>and I think you kind of have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy like lenny who's a spelling it out </v>

1636
01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:24.554
<v Speaker 5>for people and then a guy like Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 5>takes it to a different place and then </v>

1637
01:10:27.241 --> 01:10:28.074
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they just keep going and prior </v>

1638
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 5>comes along and introduces this </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible honesty to it.</v>

1639
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:33.833
<v Speaker 3>It's like each comic had one less layer </v>
<v Speaker 3>of exposition in there as almost like </v>

1640
01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:39.210
<v Speaker 3>they opened for each other</v>

1641
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.620
<v Speaker 5>decade or by five years most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1642
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.720
<v Speaker 5>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Kennison,</v>

1643
01:10:43.721 --> 01:10:44.554
<v Speaker 5>when kinison came around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the first time that I'd ever saw </v>

1644
01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:47.410
<v Speaker 5>something and went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1645
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.870
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the comedy can be anything.</v>

1646
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I thought that comedy was these </v>

1647
01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:55.800
<v Speaker 5>guys who would go on the tonight show </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's mostly what I'd see where</v>

1648
01:10:55.801 --> 01:10:57.820
<v Speaker 5>they would go to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever notice and they will be talking</v>

1649
01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:00.910
<v Speaker 5>about stuff they noticed and I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love standup comedy,</v>

1650
01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:01.744
<v Speaker 5>but I never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never thought that standup comedy was </v>

1651
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.533
<v Speaker 5>anything like Kennis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I saw Kenneth for the first </v>

1652
01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.930
<v Speaker 5>time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1653
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:08.764
<v Speaker 5>this is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy's doing a totally </v>

1654
01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:14.650
<v Speaker 5>different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is crazy.</v>

1655
01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:15.484
<v Speaker 5>He's still going to enter anxious </v>
<v Speaker 5>monologue when he was standing in front </v>

1656
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 5>of a guy going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1657
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:21.830
<v Speaker 5>you look at this face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't marry.</v>

1658
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Look at this stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was married twice.</v>

1659
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.500
<v Speaker 5>I was married for two fucking years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1660
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.770
<v Speaker 5>but nobody had ever done anything like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that before.</v>

1661
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.050
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking at that time </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1662
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:34.884
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy is really fascinating because it </v>

1663
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 5>can be so many different things,</v>

1664
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.650
<v Speaker 4>but you also want it to be a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rockstar,</v>

1665
01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:42.993
<v Speaker 4>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you see all those great things </v>

1666
01:11:44.711 --> 01:11:46.420
<v Speaker 4>that he could do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his staged craft,</v>

1667
01:11:46.421 --> 01:11:47.980
<v Speaker 4>I guess you would call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things he could do,</v>

1668
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.903
<v Speaker 4>he could really hold the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in today's world where it's pretty </v>

1669
01:11:50.711 --> 01:11:51.544
<v Speaker 4>much everyone's located,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Kinda like the new style of like </v>

1670
01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.800
<v Speaker 4>low key whatever like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to me always was like,</v>

1671
01:11:57.930 --> 01:11:59.840
<v Speaker 4>he was like a force of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was like.</v>

1672
01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:00.723
<v Speaker 4>It was like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like somebody opened the door in a </v>

1673
01:12:01.931 --> 01:12:03.310
<v Speaker 4>hurricane came in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows.</v>

1674
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:04.090
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

1675
01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:06.730
<v Speaker 5>He has something very seriously in </v>
<v Speaker 5>common.</v>

1676
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.800
<v Speaker 5>Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1677
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.700
<v Speaker 5>They both experienced significant head </v>
<v Speaker 5>injuries at a young age.</v>

1678
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:17.780
<v Speaker 5>From then on became this new person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roseann had the exact same story.</v>

1679
01:12:17.781 --> 01:12:20.200
<v Speaker 5>She got hit by a car that she got fucked</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

1680
01:12:20.201 --> 01:12:22.100
<v Speaker 5>She was in a mental hospital for nine </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

1681
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when,</v>

1682
01:12:24.321 --> 01:12:27.130
<v Speaker 5>when people talk about Roseanne and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad things about him,</v>

1683
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.270
<v Speaker 5>like you really are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that everyone a disservice</v>

1684
01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.313
<v Speaker 5>by expressing this the way you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because you're not even taking into </v>

1685
01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:38.170
<v Speaker 5>consideration everything she does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should take into consideration.</v>

1686
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.033
<v Speaker 5>She had a significant brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a massive trauma to the brain when she </v>

1687
01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:44.660
<v Speaker 5>was 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1688
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Her head bounced off of the fender of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking car.</v>

1689
01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.010
<v Speaker 5>She was laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was in a coma.</v>

1690
01:12:51.011 --> 01:12:54.340
<v Speaker 5>She was in a mental institution for nine</v>
<v Speaker 5>months after that.</v>

1691
01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:59.620
<v Speaker 5>Like this is like asking someone who has</v>
<v Speaker 5>broken legs to not limp.</v>

1692
01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.700
<v Speaker 5>Even when you are asking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even when you.</v>

1693
01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 5>I heard you talked to her about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She almost like skipped over it as if it</v>

1694
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:07.030
<v Speaker 5>was something she didn't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>address.</v>

1695
01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.330
<v Speaker 5>And you were like backtracked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had I,</v>

1696
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.290
<v Speaker 5>I had to get it out of her because this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is what I know about her and she,</v>

1697
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 5>she knows that I'm a giant fan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she knows.</v>

1698
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.520
<v Speaker 5>I always say if you have to list like </v>
<v Speaker 5>top 20 comics of all time,</v>

1699
01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.533
<v Speaker 5>Roseanne is 100 percent in there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably one of the most important ones </v>

1700
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:28.840
<v Speaker 5>because what she did when she first got </v>
<v Speaker 5>on Hbo,</v>

1701
01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:30.880
<v Speaker 5>when she first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people first start,</v>

1702
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:31.780
<v Speaker 5>she would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1703
01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:35.890
<v Speaker 5>she would fucking murder domestic on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She would murder and she.</v>

1704
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.750
<v Speaker 5>She had a totally different style.</v>

1705
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.720
<v Speaker 5>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she didn't give a fuck like when she was</v>

1706
01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:41.554
<v Speaker 5>up there as a first time you saw a woman</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was like aggressive and insulting </v>

1707
01:13:45.371 --> 01:13:48.940
<v Speaker 5>and didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't give a fuck what she looked like,</v>

1708
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.610
<v Speaker 5>didn't give a fuck what you thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>about what she looked like.</v>

1709
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.220
<v Speaker 5>She was just there to be funny and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew that I had that,</v>

1710
01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.760
<v Speaker 5>that opinion ever when she did the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it helped.</v>

1711
01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.953
<v Speaker 5>It helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not trying to hurt you in any </v>

1712
01:14:00.941 --> 01:14:02.980
<v Speaker 5>way and I just want people to understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>who you are.</v>

1713
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.040
<v Speaker 5>She's a fucking bunch of different psych</v>
<v Speaker 5>medicines,</v>

1714
01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:06.874
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got her on all kinds of crazy </v>

1715
01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:09.064
<v Speaker 5>shit trying to move it around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then on top of that she's taken and </v>

1716
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:12.574
<v Speaker 5>she's drinking and like everybody relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leave that poor lady alone like you're </v>

1717
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 5>going after when she's in her sixties </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a fuck up on twitter.</v>

1718
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 5>You thinks that that lady looks black is</v>
<v Speaker 5>lying.</v>

1719
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 5>You're either full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you didn't know if I said okay,</v>

1720
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:31.780
<v Speaker 5>you don't know anything about her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the ethnicity?</v>

1721
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:32.701
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1722
01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.570
<v Speaker 5>a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1723
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got,</v>

1724
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.453
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saved the picture on my phone in case </v>

1725
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I get into conversation with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it because it's such a.</v>

1726
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:39.843
<v Speaker 5>because it's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to look like they are in </v>

1727
01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:43.400
<v Speaker 5>any way racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1728
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.860
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to look at their racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1729
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you also have to be honest,</v>

1730
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.353
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at that and go thought that </v>

1731
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 5>was saying that Herman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she could be a lot of things.</v>

1732
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 5>She could be a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has long,</v>

1733
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:57.580
<v Speaker 5>straight hair or not long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>short,</v>

1734
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 5>straight hair like she can be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1735
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 5>This is not obvious for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say that.</v>

1736
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.554
<v Speaker 5>It's obvious you're being disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't talk to you because you're not </v>

1737
01:15:05.321 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 5>being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not realistic.</v>

1738
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:08.043
<v Speaker 5>This is not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't be tweeting about politics </v>

1739
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 5>and middle of the night on ambient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1740
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 5>she also shouldn't be tweeting about </v>
<v Speaker 5>lizard people or any other crazy shit.</v>

1741
01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 5>She tweets about trails and right</v>

1742
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:19.533
<v Speaker 4>before her Cheryl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she went from comedy to her show </v>

1743
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.190
<v Speaker 4>and once again it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1744
01:15:23.191 --> 01:15:24.024
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like her act was her show and like that </v>

1745
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 4>was one thing that like since her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was always like,</v>

1746
01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:31.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to like throw out in your act </v>

1747
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 4>like 20 minutes about like what you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>and who you think the sitcoms should be.</v>

1748
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:37.563
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't work as well for anybody else </v>

1749
01:15:40.031 --> 01:15:42.040
<v Speaker 4>except for her because that really was </v>
<v Speaker 4>her life.</v>

1750
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.163
<v Speaker 4>And it was her thing like Ray Romano was</v>
<v Speaker 4>another guy was really good at that </v>

1751
01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:47.560
<v Speaker 4>where he would put up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1752
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 4>his act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really great joke writer too.</v>

1753
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:50.494
<v Speaker 4>He was like totally like had these great</v>
<v Speaker 4>jokes about his family and his wife and </v>

1754
01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 4>the expectations of their relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that became the essence of that</v>

1755
01:15:57.701 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 4>show so that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody,</v>

1756
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:02.800
<v Speaker 4>you remember that it was definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade of like agents going like,</v>

1757
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get like,</v>

1758
01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1759
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.550
<v Speaker 4>did you have a dog growing up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do a joke about that you.</v>

1760
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.350
<v Speaker 4>And get a sitcom going on there.</v>

1761
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.373
<v Speaker 5>I went through all that shit when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were trying to do sitcoms around people </v>

1762
01:16:12.631 --> 01:16:13.464
<v Speaker 5>and they would try to get you to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>together like some sort of a theme and </v>

1763
01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:16.284
<v Speaker 5>do it on stage for a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing guys specifically craft and </v>

1764
01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:22.320
<v Speaker 5>act that they thought was going to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>12 minutes.</v>

1765
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.340
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1766
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:25.170
<v Speaker 5>People got seriously into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1767
01:16:25.171 --> 01:16:27.480
<v Speaker 5>It became like a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a goal.</v>

1768
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:30.120
<v Speaker 5>The goal was the Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Lachlan was another one.</v>

1769
01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Did you like those days acting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got lucky.</v>

1770
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got super lucky.</v>

1771
01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I got super lucky first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd never had my own show.</v>

1772
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.070
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So never had to carry anything.</v>

1773
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.020
<v Speaker 5>And then two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a really shitty one.</v>

1774
01:16:40.021 --> 01:16:42.360
<v Speaker 5>First a one that should have been really</v>
<v Speaker 5>funny,</v>

1775
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.223
<v Speaker 5>but then too many people got involved </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it got too convoluted and fucked up </v>

1776
01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:46.914
<v Speaker 5>and it just didn't work.</v>

1777
01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:47.843
<v Speaker 5>And that show got canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I got lucky that I got on a </v>

1778
01:16:49.741 --> 01:16:52.100
<v Speaker 5>show that was already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They already did the pilot,</v>

1779
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.953
<v Speaker 5>when I came onto news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ray Romano was supposed to do the </v>

1780
01:16:54.931 --> 01:16:57.060
<v Speaker 5>pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pilot rather he gets fired.</v>

1781
01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.073
<v Speaker 5>They hired a new guy and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>filmed the pilot and then after they </v>

1782
01:17:00.901 --> 01:17:01.734
<v Speaker 5>filmed the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got rid of the new guy and then I </v>

1783
01:17:03.301 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 5>came in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there was a,</v>

1784
01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:06.323
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of steps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you jumped the hard part of jumped </v>

1785
01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 5>off it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean creatively,</v>

1786
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 5>there's no way you found that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fulfilling.</v>

1787
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.363
<v Speaker 5>Maybe at the time of news radio was </v>
<v Speaker 5>unusually free in how much you could </v>

1788
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:22.670
<v Speaker 5>create.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could constantly.</v>

1789
01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 5>Paul sams is a genius and the nicest guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world and he would let you,</v>

1790
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:30.630
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would just use no ego whatsoever.</v>

1791
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.513
<v Speaker 5>The Best Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he would let Dave Foley was </v>

1792
01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:37.600
<v Speaker 5>constantly rewriting jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly introducing new punchlines.</v>

1793
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:38.300
<v Speaker 5>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1794
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.680
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1795
01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.673
<v Speaker 5>probably one of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at all the punchlines that </v>

1796
01:17:42.421 --> 01:17:44.900
<v Speaker 5>had ever been on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll like a percentage of them you would</v>

1797
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 5>attribute to date photo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a significant percentage.</v>

1798
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:48.980
<v Speaker 5>It's genius,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they would let them do it.</v>

1799
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.823
<v Speaker 5>They wanted everybody to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wanted only job where you want to </v>

1800
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:54.790
<v Speaker 5>do more than you're supposed to do and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like mad if he did all that.</v>

1801
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was eight people in the show too.</v>

1802
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:58.363
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of human beings to be talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>for 22 minutes and of course Phil was </v>

1803
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:02.690
<v Speaker 5>the star.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Phil Hartman was.</v>

1804
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:05.460
<v Speaker 4>He was so talented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy super talented.</v>

1805
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was also super professional.</v>

1806
01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.790
<v Speaker 5>I would prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have.</v>

1807
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.760
<v Speaker 5>He would have a clipboard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1808
01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:17.970
<v Speaker 5>or a notebook with all of his scenes in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there with different colors for the tabs</v>

1809
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:19.800
<v Speaker 5>and he would practice them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be.</v>

1810
01:18:19.801 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 5>You'd see him sitting there by himself </v>
<v Speaker 5>just going over his lines,</v>

1811
01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.690
<v Speaker 5>moving his head back and then after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:27.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was a fucking meticulous </v>
<v Speaker 5>professional.</v>

1813
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:28.783
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

1814
01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying about like some guys,</v>

1815
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.810
<v Speaker 4>especially the comics where they go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get that,</v>

1816
01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 4>that microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1817
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:36.944
<v Speaker 4>sorry about the comics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get the Sitcom and then they ride </v>

1818
01:18:40.461 --> 01:18:41.294
<v Speaker 4>it as long as they can and then then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they go back to stand up and we've seen </v>

1819
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1820
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:45.223
<v Speaker 4>you can throw a dart at like a schedule </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere in the country and you'll see </v>

1821
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:49.760
<v Speaker 4>that guy and I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always like,</v>

1822
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:50.594
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it sad that you didn't keep doing </v>

1823
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 4>the standup because now you're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>right back to where you started in terms</v>

1824
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:56.084
<v Speaker 4>of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he didn't get to grow that way </v>

1825
01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:58.570
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 4>And I don't do it for years and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's always like,</v>

1827
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:02.984
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the best touring time when you </v>

1828
01:19:03.591 --> 01:19:05.690
<v Speaker 4>have a sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most people don't want to go on tour</v>

1829
01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:06.470
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:07.610
<v Speaker 4>To me I would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Let's get out there.</v>

1832
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but well you,</v>

1833
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 4>you could do it for a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1834
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.320
<v Speaker 4>the schedule</v>

1835
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.380
<v Speaker 5>you're filming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be stuck at in La.</v>

1836
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:17.423
<v Speaker 5>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially back then when you start out </v>

1837
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:20.874
<v Speaker 5>a sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing 12 hour days until you </v>

1838
01:19:22.051 --> 01:19:23.340
<v Speaker 5>figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

1839
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Once the show had been figured out by </v>
<v Speaker 5>like season three or four,</v>

1840
01:19:26.521 --> 01:19:29.970
<v Speaker 5>we were down to like three days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes four days a week.</v>

1841
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.270
<v Speaker 5>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mostly for very rarely five,</v>

1842
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:38.540
<v Speaker 5>unless there was some significant crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>semination make we did 98 I think.</v>

1843
01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just did three,</v>

1844
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.870
<v Speaker 5>maybe [inaudible] 99,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1845
01:19:45.871 --> 01:19:46.530
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1846
01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 5>I did a hundred and 48 fear factors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1847
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.690
<v Speaker 5>Then I did six more than we did when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it came back six or seven more.</v>

1848
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.640
<v Speaker 5>I think we did seven but 48.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.150
<v Speaker 5>That was preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was when I was losing my mind.</v>

1850
01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't even one a day or was it less </v>
<v Speaker 5>than.</v>

1851
01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one took three days.</v>

1852
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you could bang out one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two days.</v>

1853
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:11.070
<v Speaker 5>Like you could have the beast on early </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the day and at night,</v>

1854
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 5>like the final stone at night.</v>

1855
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1856
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very fortunate.</v>

1857
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 5>It was a great gig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plenty of money and it was all good.</v>

1858
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:24.510
<v Speaker 5>It definitely helped my standup because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it gave me fuck you money too.</v>

1859
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.433
<v Speaker 5>It gave me the ability to not worry </v>
<v Speaker 5>about like having money in the bank </v>

1860
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 5>because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have like extravagant tastes.</v>

1861
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:31.944
<v Speaker 5>I'm not too ridiculous with money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I like feeling like I don't have to </v>

1862
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:36.414
<v Speaker 5>worry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like as soon as you don't have to worry </v>

1863
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:37.651
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1864
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't think about that anymore.</v>

1865
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:40.310
<v Speaker 5>Now think about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it,</v>

1866
01:20:40.311 --> 01:20:41.144
<v Speaker 5>it really helped me there and also the </v>
<v Speaker 5>apostrophe of it was a boundless source </v>

1867
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:48.120
<v Speaker 5>of material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just such a ridiculous show that</v>

1868
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:50.900
<v Speaker 3>I hosted a spinoff that didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>picked up.</v>

1869
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.570
<v Speaker 3>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say uncle her.</v>

1870
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his show too?</v>

1871
01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.493
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't and I was right on the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and that's how I knew David </v>

1872
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Horowitz who was producing fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had a show called say uncle.</v>

1873
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:06.680
<v Speaker 3>They try later paranoid in the De Niro </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1874
01:21:06.681 --> 01:21:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I wrote the comedian called like stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle or whatever it was.</v>

1875
01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:12.740
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big,</v>

1876
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:13.783
<v Speaker 3>one of the big things was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contestant got in a Turkey pen and we </v>

1877
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.260
<v Speaker 3>put maple syrup all over when he rolled </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in these like birds,</v>

1878
01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:23.210
<v Speaker 3>like pecked at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1879
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.193
<v Speaker 3>his family's there watching and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts bleeding and she and I stopped a </v>

1880
01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:30.350
<v Speaker 3>thing and the producers were mad like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop in the middle of like the</v>

1881
01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:34.220
<v Speaker 3>guy's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go and it was just a total disaster.</v>

1882
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.690
<v Speaker 3>You could tell it was going to be a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit,</v>

1883
01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:36.524
<v Speaker 3>but it was risky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I remember going to Jimmy </v>

1884
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Kimmel's like Premiere Party for Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim alive.</v>

1885
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:44.480
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the head of ABC,</v>

1886
01:21:44.481 --> 01:21:45.314
<v Speaker 3>they're a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd never done this in my entire </v>

1887
01:21:47.241 --> 01:21:48.650
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like getting a drink.</v>

1888
01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And I walked over and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't pick it up.</v>

1889
01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:54.470
<v Speaker 3>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

1890
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:58.610
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be too hard to stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind really torturing people.</v>

1891
01:21:59.690 --> 01:22:00.523
<v Speaker 3>Didn't pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just kinda looked at me and </v>

1892
01:22:02.901 --> 01:22:04.100
<v Speaker 3>smiled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this,</v>

1893
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.320
<v Speaker 3>this would've been 2003.</v>

1894
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was right after fear factor was </v>

1895
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:11.490
<v Speaker 5>first launched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

1896
01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:12.373
<v Speaker 5>when those shows what happens is you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to one thing and so you have to do </v>

1897
01:22:16.251 --> 01:22:18.650
<v Speaker 5>something that's bigger and better than </v>
<v Speaker 5>next year.</v>

1898
01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.753
<v Speaker 5>And so when we came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt uncomfortable with a lot of the </v>

1899
01:22:23.001 --> 01:22:23.834
<v Speaker 5>shit they know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like these guys are top of the food </v>

1900
01:22:26.181 --> 01:22:27.080
<v Speaker 5>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They.</v>

1901
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.943
<v Speaker 5>But they were doing some sketchy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like one of them we had these people </v>

1902
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:32.383
<v Speaker 5>chained to a tree with a bungee cords </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were attached to a helicopter and </v>

1903
01:22:37.821 --> 01:22:38.654
<v Speaker 5>they had to figure out the right locks </v>
<v Speaker 5>to unlock the bungee cord that they're </v>

1904
01:22:41.801 --> 01:22:44.870
<v Speaker 5>the straps to keep them to the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as soon as they do,</v>

1905
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:45.853
<v Speaker 5>they undo the strap and they go fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting out into space into the center </v>

1906
01:22:50.631 --> 01:22:55.430
<v Speaker 5>of this giant Canyon and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>bouncing underneath this helicopter.</v>

1907
01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this does it.</v>

1908
01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:01.010
<v Speaker 5>We could do this a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them,</v>

1909
01:23:01.011 --> 01:23:02.990
<v Speaker 5>someone's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course one of them,</v>

1910
01:23:02.991 --> 01:23:04.690
<v Speaker 5>someone's going to die and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next one.</v>

1911
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:06.610
<v Speaker 5>It never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got lucky dude.</v>

1912
01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:08.440
<v Speaker 5>I really feel like we got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

1913
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 5>really honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 percent feel like we got lucky.</v>

1914
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 5>There was a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1915
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.083
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain amount of risk that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you take whenever you're doing anything </v>

1916
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:18.610
<v Speaker 5>like jump your car off of a building </v>
<v Speaker 5>roof,</v>

1917
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 5>which we did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had people fly cars across a train,</v>

1918
01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 5>a moving train.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1919
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:25.690
<v Speaker 5>There's risk involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1920
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 5>But the one that scared the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>me the most was bull riding.</v>

1921
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:29.913
<v Speaker 5>We had people ride bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the only time I had told </v>

1922
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:32.410
<v Speaker 5>contestants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do it.</v>

1923
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.161
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1924
01:23:33.161 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 5>if you want to ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say don't do it on air.</v>

1925
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1926
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:37.271
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1927
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 5>Before we go on air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I gave them the standard,</v>

1928
01:23:41.130 --> 01:23:43.930
<v Speaker 5>but when I would talk to them I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1929
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.030
<v Speaker 5>it's up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1930
01:23:46.031 --> 01:23:48.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you want to go on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people do know how to ride bulls,</v>

1931
01:23:48.221 --> 01:23:49.054
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know how to ride a bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not teaching you how to ride a </v>

1932
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 5>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going through classes.</v>

1933
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.014
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Slowly but surely building up your </v>

1934
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 5>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just going to go ride a bull.</v>

1935
01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do that.</v>

1936
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 5>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we had this girl,</v>

1937
01:24:01.511 --> 01:24:02.344
<v Speaker 5>she was like 98 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got launched off the back of this </v>

1938
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:04.984
<v Speaker 5>bowl and she'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people went fucking flying that </v>

1939
01:24:09.330 --> 01:24:11.540
<v Speaker 5>things kicking fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bear.</v>

1940
01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barely misses them when it's kicking.</v>

1941
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're wearing helmets and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at this.</v>

1942
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>

1943
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on man.</v>

1944
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

1945
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 5>that fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way she felt like that.</v>

1946
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 5>That is like getting hit in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head with the world.</v>

1947
01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.253
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like my personal feelings about </v>

1948
01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:32.920
<v Speaker 5>trauma and about what's dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit like this.</v>

1949
01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 5>This is a no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1950
01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 5>Especially for a 90 pound woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this poor lady.</v>

1951
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got up cute little fellow.</v>

1952
01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:42.190
<v Speaker 5>I was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1953
01:24:42.191 --> 01:24:42.941
<v Speaker 5>she got up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1954
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 5>She was tough as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But everybody.</v>

1955
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 5>I feel like in that one I feel like we </v>
<v Speaker 5>got lucky.</v>

1956
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:50.350
<v Speaker 5>I feel like we've rolled the dice </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if they stop you,</v>

1957
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:52.670
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lacerate livers and crushed.</v>

1958
01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 5>Crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can stump you.</v>

1959
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 5>The funny thing was those stunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys are so fucking tough.</v>

1960
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:00.843
<v Speaker 5>Those guys are so used to putting their </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass on the line that they don't think </v>

1961
01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 5>anything about someone doing something </v>
<v Speaker 5>risky to them.</v>

1962
01:25:07.211 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You show up for work and</v>

1963
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.990
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a different in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head like Alpha something.</v>

1964
01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Animals have to do that to be a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to crave that.</v>

1965
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Like a wonder what the family's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it keep them from having a family?</v>

1966
01:25:21.611 --> 01:25:22.444
<v Speaker 1>There's a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to marry you if you're </v>

1967
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 1>throwing your life in the line unrelated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to war or famine.</v>

1968
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain allure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that TV show.</v>

1969
01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 1>The fall guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about evil knievel?</v>

1970
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Women loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women loved evil knievel.</v>

1971
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>If that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may love risk takers.</v>

1972
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:39.154
<v Speaker 1>They like bmx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that do those flips and shit and </v>

1973
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:42.243
<v Speaker 1>those guys or those guys really shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now they have the park core guys </v>

1974
01:25:45.371 --> 01:25:47.440
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like climb up a building with no.</v>

1975
01:25:47.441 --> 01:25:48.221
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1976
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:49.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of.</v>

1977
01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So you could smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do park Parkour on a iron iron</v>

1978
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 1>grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you exercise at all day?</v>

1979
01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I do the kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1980
01:25:58.211 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still doing that.</v>

1981
01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1982
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:03.990
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to ask you this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The microphone</v>

1983
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.610
<v Speaker 4>is like I seem to be getting more out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull ups and,</v>

1984
01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:09.120
<v Speaker 4>and just regular calisthenics and am out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

1985
01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 4>out of the Kettlebell experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because like maybe I'm just</v>

1986
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.550
<v Speaker 4>more into it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1987
01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.633
<v Speaker 5>Well there's definitely no better </v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise for you then pull ups and push </v>

1988
01:26:18.001 --> 01:26:19.990
<v Speaker 5>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That to me is if I,</v>

1989
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.780
<v Speaker 5>if somebody had to save for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life,</v>

1990
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:24.540
<v Speaker 5>you gotta pull up bar and no weights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:26.220
<v Speaker 5>You know you're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

1992
01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I'll take that over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not having a pull up bar because I think</v>

1993
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.173
<v Speaker 5>there's certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's certain kinds of workouts when </v>

1994
01:26:32.671 --> 01:26:35.710
<v Speaker 5>you manipulate your own body to pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think too,</v>

1995
01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:36.683
<v Speaker 5>because you could vary your pushup </v>
<v Speaker 5>widths and you could do so many things </v>

1996
01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:41.430
<v Speaker 5>just with Chin ups and pushups and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>with bodyweight,</v>

1997
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.710
<v Speaker 5>like single leg squats and things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1998
01:26:43.711 --> 01:26:46.770
<v Speaker 5>you can get a tremendous workout in with</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a chin up bar.</v>

1999
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Body weight and then there's something </v>

2000
01:26:49.901 --> 01:26:51.820
<v Speaker 4>about like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do 100 of them,</v>

2001
01:26:51.821 --> 01:26:54.400
<v Speaker 4>like I can't even do like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 10 would be great for me.</v>

2002
01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:57.520
<v Speaker 4>But like the guys who can do 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard.</v>

2003
01:26:57.521 --> 01:27:00.160
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like torture to do ups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chin ups.</v>

2004
01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You can do 100 chin ups is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>sap.</v>

2005
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2006
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:05.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that definitely is the goal.</v>

2007
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2008
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:10.500
<v Speaker 5>I'll do 100 in two sets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:11.443
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do sets of 10 and I don't do any more </v>

2010
01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:17.190
<v Speaker 5>than 10 and I do them multiple times a </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

2011
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.173
<v Speaker 5>Like I have a chin up bar in my house so</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll walk in and I'll just jump up and </v>

2012
01:27:20.931 --> 01:27:21.764
<v Speaker 5>do 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 and I've found that like the one </v>

2013
01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:24.774
<v Speaker 5>thing that's helped my squeeze with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu and with being able to pick my </v>

2014
01:27:28.381 --> 01:27:30.360
<v Speaker 5>body and just move around better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2015
01:27:30.361 --> 01:27:32.550
<v Speaker 5>just do them randomly throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

2016
01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:34.820
<v Speaker 5>I do chin ups all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whenever,</v>

2017
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:35.683
<v Speaker 5>like those bars in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do a show here and then I'll go </v>

2018
01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 5>back and do tension.</v>

2019
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:43.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm like that with masturbation so I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex any time you're ready to go,</v>

2020
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.130
<v Speaker 4>ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2021
01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:46.403
<v Speaker 5>if I had to pick one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be that it'd be a chin up bar </v>

2022
01:27:48.121 --> 01:27:50.850
<v Speaker 5>and then bodyweight stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could do that for sure.</v>

2023
01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.290
<v Speaker 5>That's not into the kettle bells</v>

2024
01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.290
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the road.</v>

2025
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.750
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2026
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.400
<v Speaker 4>like I don't like go into the hotel gym </v>
<v Speaker 4>or anything like that.</v>

2027
01:27:57.401 --> 01:27:58.234
<v Speaker 4>I like to keep it in the room so </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you jump rope or something </v>

2028
01:28:01.061 --> 01:28:01.894
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say I've gotten in better </v>

2029
01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:05.740
<v Speaker 4>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still feel like,</v>

2030
01:28:05.741 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2031
01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crap most of the time.</v>

2032
01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:10.870
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid when I was a kid,</v>

2033
01:28:10.871 --> 01:28:13.630
<v Speaker 4>like it was all that stuff like pushups </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sit ups and all that kind of stuff.</v>

2034
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.070
<v Speaker 4>And now that I'm back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2035
01:28:15.071 --> 01:28:16.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot how great this is.</v>

2036
01:28:16.751 --> 01:28:17.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really cool.</v>

2037
01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.573
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's a great thing for the pull ups </v>

2038
01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.210
<v Speaker 4>afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those trx things.</v>

2039
01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now my trainer was</v>

2040
01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.013
<v Speaker 5>to the door of the hotel room and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could do all these crazy exercises and </v>

2041
01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:31.720
<v Speaker 5>it's real small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just tuck it in your bag.</v>

2042
01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.730
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the hotel room.</v>

2043
01:28:33.731 --> 01:28:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Like we've all seen that in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the assassin doing a couple,</v>

2044
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:38.770
<v Speaker 4>a couple of very slow pushups.</v>

2045
01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:40.643
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes if I go down to a gym and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing that I want to do in </v>

2046
01:28:42.631 --> 01:28:43.890
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll work out my hotel room.</v>

2047
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:45.580
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never were like a runner.</v>

2048
01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:46.414
<v Speaker 4>Were you like a run now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's only been over the last couple </v>

2049
01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:49.563
<v Speaker 4>of years really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even when you were like doing a </v>

2050
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:51.993
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2051
01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Never had much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was part of their thing.</v>

2052
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:56.320
<v Speaker 4>They had like a military kind of feel to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2053
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Definitely</v>

2054
01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:59.270
<v Speaker 5>a military feel to it and some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some different.</v>

2055
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would call it Dojo gangs.</v>

2056
01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeff's a black</v>

2057

<v Speaker 2>bow tie.</v>

2058
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are actually on the show.</v>

2059
01:29:04.941 --> 01:29:07.700
<v Speaker 1>He pulls out the nunchucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a part of it,</v>

2060
01:29:07.701 --> 01:29:08.534
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

2061
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rusty.</v>

2062
01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I have to admit I need to get back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you exercise these days.</v>

2063
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:15.283
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing a little bit of Yoga but</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly I've been doing a lot of not </v>

2064
01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:21.800
<v Speaker 3>exercising lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like feel good.</v>

2065
01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm going a place now where I need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to start exercising again.</v>

2066
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.860
<v Speaker 3>We talked about this in the parking lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day.</v>

2067
01:29:27.861 --> 01:29:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on a standup hiatus and when I'm not</v>

2068
01:29:30.501 --> 01:29:31.334
<v Speaker 3>performing I don't care as much about my</v>
<v Speaker 3>instrument and I've been editing and </v>

2069
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:36.404
<v Speaker 3>writing and producing so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten a little not late I guess </v>

2070
01:29:39.321 --> 01:29:44.321
<v Speaker 3>lazy and I don't feel as good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know I recognize it in my body so</v>

2071
01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 3>I need to snap out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he needs,</v>

2072
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2073
01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.550
<v Speaker 1>like a group or like people to hang with</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2074
01:29:52.551 --> 01:29:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that would make it more fun going out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2075
01:29:54.710 --> 01:29:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was like a.</v>

2076
01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:56.990

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't let us down.</v>

2078
01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.750
<v Speaker 2>You could find like a crossfit class to </v>
<v Speaker 2>join or some shit like that.</v>

2079
01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean they always have those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2080
01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:08.521
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of different classes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know is awesome.</v>

2081
01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I've done one of those high intensity </v>
<v Speaker 2>interval training things at a yoga place</v>

2082
01:30:14.561 --> 01:30:17.440

<v Speaker 2>like really light weights,</v>

<v Speaker 2>No one can see you.</v>

2091
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to grab both legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>

2092
01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And the headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it to the new level.</v>

2097
01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like a NASA mission called again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cry for help.</v>

2098
01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.650
<v Speaker 1>The crab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

2099
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.150
<v Speaker 1>when you say you do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how often do you do it?</v>

2100
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:13.130
<v Speaker 3>What I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go to hot yoga.</v>

2101
01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:13.964
<v Speaker 3>You go a couple times a week are now I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of do it in my backyard to </v>

2102
01:31:16.251 --> 01:31:18.290
<v Speaker 3>stretch out after a long flight or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2103
01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:19.213
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything kind of like you had the tank </v>

2104
01:31:21.411 --> 01:31:24.550
<v Speaker 3>like that's a time to think about life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To think through it.</v>

2105
01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Think through a mission that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on.</v>

2106
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Some family issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like quiet.</v>

2107
01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:30.470
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about you.</v>

2108
01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:31.611
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga,</v>

2109
01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:36.611
<v Speaker 3>it's like giving yourself a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more gratifying than going to glory</v>

2110
01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:38.120
<v Speaker 3>awaits and stuff.</v>

2111
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Stretch out before sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever do that?</v>

2112
01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Stretches before you go do set feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>real good.</v>

2113
01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:45.470
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that that's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing.</v>

2114
01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Puts you in a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you carry around.</v>

2115
01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:48.733
<v Speaker 2>When you're tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you carry around a lot of tension that </v>

2116
01:31:51.471 --> 01:31:52.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily want.</v>

2117
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Pigeon pose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the tension is.</v>

2118
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Pigeon pose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one where your.</v>

2119
01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Where your leg comes under</v>

2120
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask what the fuck is he doing?</v>

2121
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff,</v>

2122
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:06.401
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2123
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2124
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's called a hip opener.</v>

2125
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2126
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That good hips,</v>

2127
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks so sad.</v>

2128
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to your yoga,</v>

2129
01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:20.883
<v Speaker 2>people will do that pose and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying because there's so much emotion </v>

2130
01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.140
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety release from the hitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not real job.</v>

2131
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:28.350
<v Speaker 2>You're just crying because someone tells</v>
<v Speaker 2>you you should cry.</v>

2132
01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.113
<v Speaker 2>Sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be a part of this group </v>

2133
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.823
<v Speaker 2>cry nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always want to say that this is </v>

2134
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:37.480
<v Speaker 2>opening up your colon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any fucking.</v>

2135
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:41.140
<v Speaker 2>There's no diagrams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where the colon is like,</v>

2136
01:32:41.141 --> 01:32:41.974
<v Speaker 2>you better stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better stop saying that you don't </v>

2137
01:32:43.361 --> 01:32:47.470
<v Speaker 2>have any fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's tension in the hip.</v>

2138
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Cat Scans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that stuff called?</v>

2139
01:32:49.391 --> 01:32:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Magnetic residence Mris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that Brown.</v>

2140
01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:53.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any real evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's emotion.</v>

2141
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Who should lead a bowl of me?</v>

2142
01:32:57.290 --> 01:33:00.600
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just thinking about my dad much</v>

2143
01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

2144
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any memories specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people say,</v>

2145
01:33:06.521 --> 01:33:06.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2146
01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:07.714
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm in that position and they </v>

2147
01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 2>tell you that it's an if emotions come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out here,</v>

2148
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you just let them like what emotions</v>

2149
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:14.933
<v Speaker 7>cut out.</v>

2150
01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:17.993
<v Speaker 2>You've been hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone told you our mission to be </v>

2151
01:33:21.781 --> 01:33:23.700
<v Speaker 2>emotionally vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2152
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.593
<v Speaker 2>that that in hypnosis and you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that eating lunch at a deli or working </v>

2153
01:33:28.741 --> 01:33:31.110
<v Speaker 2>out with the boys in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're at a quiet,</v>

2154
01:33:31.111 --> 01:33:35.850
<v Speaker 2>dark yoga place with other people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are staring at their own at the floor,</v>

2155
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:38.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can relax a little emotionally.</v>

2156
01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.473
<v Speaker 2>That's a logical definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a logical way of explaining </v>

2157
01:33:42.511 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay.</v>

2158
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just good to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question.</v>

2159
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you eat before you go on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2160
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Me Neither.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy has to eat like he asked.</v>

2161
01:33:54.011 --> 01:33:56.580
<v Speaker 2>He eat before he goes on stage like </v>
<v Speaker 2>right before,</v>

2162
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.823
<v Speaker 2>like pretty much right before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think there's anything </v>

2163
01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:02.190
<v Speaker 2>wrong with eating some fruit right </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go up on stage,</v>

2164
01:34:02.191 --> 01:34:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

2165
01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount of resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is going to use for digestion.</v>

2166
01:34:07.201 --> 01:34:08.034
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why fighters don't eat </v>

2167
01:34:10.681 --> 01:34:12.270
<v Speaker 2>a fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can mash potatoes,</v>

2168
01:34:12.271 --> 01:34:14.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that fight because your body will</v>

2169
01:34:14.371 --> 01:34:16.200
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you dude.</v>

2170
01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.080
<v Speaker 2>We got to digest this stuff and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sloshed around your stomach.</v>

2171
01:34:19.081 --> 01:34:20.460
<v Speaker 2>It gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

2172
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know plenty of people who have to eat.</v>

2173
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I in that first episode of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

2174
01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:27.654
<v Speaker 2>I eat during the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ordered Mozzarella sticks to the </v>

2175
01:34:30.781 --> 01:34:31.614
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how hungry I was by the late </v>

2176
01:34:33.391 --> 01:34:34.224
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that meant </v>

2177
01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:35.723
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to say that you can't do it and for </v>

2178
01:34:36.901 --> 01:34:37.734
<v Speaker 2>you you're so casual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're probably better off feeling </v>

2179
01:34:40.051 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 2>good then you are like being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having more mental alertness.</v>

2180
01:34:44.981 --> 01:34:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Slightly out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also like being hungry.</v>

2181
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

2182
01:34:48.421 --> 01:34:51.060
<v Speaker 2>There's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate in the car.</v>

2183
01:34:51.061 --> 01:34:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Coming to your studio today and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first thing I said to Jeff Atlanta,</v>

2184
01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:55.883
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there anything to eat around here </v>

2185
01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 2>because it's</v>

2186
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 1>like it's an anxiety thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like before you're going to perform and </v>

2187
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading years and years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years ago that David letterman</v>

2188
01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:08.330
<v Speaker 1>would eat pineapple right before he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2189
01:35:08.331 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>so I always ask for pineapple in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer's.</v>

2190
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Hi Stacy Pineapples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good stacy marketing sales.</v>

2191
01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.080
<v Speaker 1>He'd also would do a fasting and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would pick out.</v>

2192
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.630
<v Speaker 1>That was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let him in.</v>

2193
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.593
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would like not eat for like two </v>

2194
01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:25.700
<v Speaker 1>or three days and then he would do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how my friend Russ does it.</v>

2195
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of thing of like where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like just basically spartan,</v>

2196
01:35:29.901 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

2197
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:31.634
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like you get to eat whatever </v>

2198
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:33.104
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe for sure that people eat too </v>

2199
01:35:34.341 --> 01:35:36.900
<v Speaker 1>much food and me included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat too much meat</v>

2200
01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:40.090
<v Speaker 5>and when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I fast like especially intermittent</v>

2201
01:35:40.091 --> 01:35:42.670
<v Speaker 5>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do like 16 hours at night when I do do</v>

2202
01:35:42.671 --> 01:35:43.720
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel way better.</v>

2203
01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:44.570
<v Speaker 5>Way Better.</v>

2204
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:45.403
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fascinates between dinner and the </v>

2205
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>next time I eat is 16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

2206
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.450
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2207
01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Could you just decide in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you go to bed?</v>

2208
01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Would have to be getting a colonoscopy </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you just look,</v>

2209
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you eat dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd done it eight.</v>

2210
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.970
<v Speaker 1>You go to bed or do whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

2211
01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but just know more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>

2212
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

2213
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat to come on at 10.</v>

2214
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:13.430
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I want to do is eat any </v>
<v Speaker 1>later than eight.</v>

2215
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I go right to the cookies in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store.</v>

2216
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Cookies</v>

2217
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 5>are different though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's quick.</v>

2218
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:23.540
<v Speaker 5>Carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That actually is not a bad idea.</v>

2219
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.390
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a bad idea at all.</v>

2220
01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't need that stuff to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat that stuff.</v>

2221
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:34.150
<v Speaker 5>When I was doing this sober October </v>
<v Speaker 5>fitness challenge with Ari and Tom Seger</v>

2222
01:36:34.191 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 5>and Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat everything in sight.</v>

2223
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:36.644
<v Speaker 5>I ate pizza and cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat everything because it's just one </v>

2224
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.613
<v Speaker 5>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the problem with cookies and stuff </v>

2225
01:36:42.081 --> 01:36:43.310
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can eat them,</v>

2226
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:44.413
<v Speaker 5>but you just can't make a habit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating them all the time or will fuck </v>

2227
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:47.960
<v Speaker 5>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just gonna fuck you up.</v>

2228
01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.340
<v Speaker 5>When you go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a bad idea.</v>

2229
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.030
<v Speaker 5>Got a little pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Energy,</v>

2230
01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:53.993
<v Speaker 5>quick carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body's going to break down those </v>

2231
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:58.670
<v Speaker 5>carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Sugar and glucose is a very good fuel</v>

2232
01:36:58.671 --> 01:37:00.800
<v Speaker 5>for the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really works.</v>

2233
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.353
<v Speaker 5>Carbs are good for the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in like if your body's carb </v>

2235
01:37:05.091 --> 01:37:05.600
<v Speaker 5>adapted.</v>

2236
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.433
<v Speaker 5>If you eat carbs all the time and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can eat some carbs right before you go </v>

2237
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:11.090
<v Speaker 5>onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'll give you like a little energy.</v>

2238
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I feel so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even lift.</v>

2239
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

2240
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:14.263
<v Speaker 5>like if you wanted to have a cookie or </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even a snickers bar and then lift </v>

2241
01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:17.474
<v Speaker 5>weights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't.</v>

2242
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:18.343
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say that'll give you some fucking sugar </v>

2243
01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:22.064
<v Speaker 5>to burn off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not the best food for you in </v>

2244
01:37:23.541 --> 01:37:24.374
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're asking for it for a very </v>

2245
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.410
<v Speaker 5>specific reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like after it's over,</v>

2246
01:37:27.411 --> 01:37:28.244
<v Speaker 5>I'd say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go have some salmon and some vegetables </v>

2247
01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 5>and eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but right before you want to work out.</v>

2248
01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:34.154
<v Speaker 5>Like you could drink a coke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could drink a coca cola and if </v>

2249
01:37:37.190 --> 01:37:38.570
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lift for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2250
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drink a coke.</v>

2251
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.453
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to burn that shit off and it's </v>

2252
01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:43.620
<v Speaker 5>just going to be fueled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That you use is.</v>

2253
01:37:43.650 --> 01:37:46.010
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't suggest you do it all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2254
01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.500
<v Speaker 5>but it's not going to have a negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect on you.</v>

2255
01:37:48.501 --> 01:37:51.680
<v Speaker 5>It's really a cumulative thing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in diets.</v>

2256
01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.753
<v Speaker 5>It's eating too much sugar or too much </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit for too many days in a row and </v>

2257
01:37:56.461 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 5>not giving your body a chance to relax.</v>

2258
01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.770
<v Speaker 4>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I don't eat,</v>

2259
01:38:00.771 --> 01:38:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I never considered like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2260
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.220
<v Speaker 4>that's lightheadedness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2261
01:38:04.221 --> 01:38:05.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably having a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2262
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.400
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should find a place to lay down.</v>

2263
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>

2264
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 2>food is fucking phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2265
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:14.994
<v Speaker 2>And you're lucky you live in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City and then you come to la so you're </v>

2266
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.164
<v Speaker 2>in both places and you're in two spots </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have some of the greatest </v>

2267
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 2>restaurants on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're like a Foodie,</v>

2268
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Foodie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cash,</v>

2269
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:30.870

<v Speaker 2>you can go wherever the fuck you want.</v>

2270
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:31.704
<v Speaker 2>I do order a nice bottle of wine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking beautiful steak with the </v>

2271
01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 2>right accoutrements and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you?</v>

2272
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful pleasure and evaluate a</v>

2273
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:46.460
<v Speaker 2>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some red meat fucker fight.</v>

2274
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm either on</v>

2275
01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.190
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I eat a steak and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>need them as much as I used to,</v>

2276
01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:57.550
<v Speaker 4>but a lot on the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>She'd eat more that I love a good steak.</v>

2285
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

2286
01:39:16.570 --> 01:39:17.403
<v Speaker 5>I think what's wrong with steak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would people think was wrong with </v>

2287
01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.133
<v Speaker 5>Ron?</v>
<v Speaker 5>With red meat is all the stuff you eat </v>

2288
01:39:21.941 --> 01:39:24.640
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the sugar and bullshit and bread and</v>

2289
01:39:24.641 --> 01:39:28.270
<v Speaker 5>pasta and then alcohol and sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2290
01:39:28.271 --> 01:39:29.104
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think if you're a healthy person </v>

2291
01:39:30.701 --> 01:39:33.790
<v Speaker 5>who exercise all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think stakes bad for you at all.</v>

2292
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good for you.</v>

2293
01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:37.180
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the opposite of bad for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2294
01:39:37.181 --> 01:39:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I think all of our preconceived notions </v>
<v Speaker 5>about what's healthy,</v>

2295
01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.350
<v Speaker 5>all of them vary because some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that really don't do good with red meat.</v>

2296
01:39:44.351 --> 01:39:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Some people don't do well with fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have weird,</v>

2297
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:48.970
<v Speaker 4>but I don't eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it either.</v>

2298
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Do you eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like steps up your whole game,</v>

2300
01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:54.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>

2301
01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:55.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a lifesaving thing.</v>

2302
01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.771
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you get it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that you can get from like an oily fish,</v>

2304

<v Speaker 5>Do you take fish oil at all?</v>

2337
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:12.274
<v Speaker 5>because big we brought it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were staying at a hotel and we </v>

2338
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:15.030
<v Speaker 5>brought it to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2339
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:15.963
<v Speaker 5>the waiter or the chef in the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 5>would cook stuff for you and you would </v>

2340
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:21.640
<v Speaker 5>just bring them to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2348
01:41:31.721 --> 01:41:32.554
<v Speaker 5>ways because there's a huge fish so I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can make you guys a little bit of </v>

2349
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.510
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of Sushi.</v>

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean we caught it and then six hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>later we're eating it for lunch.</v>

2353
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.690
<v Speaker 5>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so good.</v>

2354
01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:47.780
<v Speaker 5>That is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2356
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:51.310
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another name for it.</v>

2357
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:53.080
<v Speaker 5>And the Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call it an oh no.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

2359
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.490
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still licious.</v>

2360
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:56.380
<v Speaker 5>It's so good</v>

2361
01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.240
<v Speaker 1>fishes looking at the camera too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

2362
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2363
01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like fishing over hunting?</v>

2364
01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing is harder.</v>

2365
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both you do</v>

2366
01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:13.700
<v Speaker 5>is way more intense and I feel way worse</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the animal.</v>

2367
01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't feel bad for them.</v>

2368
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2369
01:42:16.650 --> 01:42:17.483
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2370
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:19.460
<v Speaker 5>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just being honest,</v>

2371
01:42:19.461 --> 01:42:21.740
<v Speaker 5>like if I catch a big salmon and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2372
01:42:21.741 --> 01:42:23.330
<v Speaker 5>sorry dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2373
01:42:23.331 --> 01:42:24.920
<v Speaker 5>but this is what I'm here for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2374
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 5>but when I shoot a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2375
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:29.210
<v Speaker 5>there's always a little part of me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2376
01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:32.370
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2377
01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.650
<v Speaker 5>this is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2378
01:42:33.651 --> 01:42:36.620
<v Speaker 5>I eat and I know that if I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2379
01:42:36.621 --> 01:42:37.454
<v Speaker 5>they're going to die of starvation or </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease or they're going to be ripped </v>

2380
01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:41.840
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asshole first by coyotes.</v>

2381
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.360
<v Speaker 5>Like this is not a good end for them no </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter what.</v>

2382
01:42:44.361 --> 01:42:45.194
<v Speaker 5>And me shooting them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably the best end they're ever </v>

2383
01:42:46.401 --> 01:42:48.800
<v Speaker 5>going to get all those justifications </v>
<v Speaker 5>aside.</v>

2384
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:51.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a different feeling when you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>like an elk down.</v>

2385
01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Then when I catch a salmon salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's 100 percent happiness.</v>

2386
01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.630
<v Speaker 1>But what about when you pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger?</v>

2387
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing the animal downs one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about knowing it's coming?</v>

2388
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hunter.</v>

2389
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:07.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get emotional.</v>

2390
01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.130
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

2391
01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.500
<v Speaker 5>You get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to fuck it up.</v>

2392
01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:13.320
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to injure anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of anticipation in that</v>

2393
01:43:13.321 --> 01:43:14.154
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of,</v>

2394
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:15.223
<v Speaker 5>it's very intense and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever amount of meat you get from </v>

2395
01:43:20.281 --> 01:43:21.840
<v Speaker 5>that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you eat it,</v>

2396
01:43:21.841 --> 01:43:24.720
<v Speaker 5>you're going to think about that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think about that moment.</v>

2397
01:43:24.721 --> 01:43:28.080
<v Speaker 5>Every time I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let slip while you think about it.</v>

2398
01:43:28.081 --> 01:43:28.914
<v Speaker 5>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was a intense life or death moment </v>

2399

<v Speaker 5>I'm eating it so I know exactly what the</v>

2401
01:43:39.451 --> 01:43:44.451
<v Speaker 5>food is as opposed to going to Morton's </v>

<v Speaker 2>We do party boats for bluefish and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a spot and everybody dropped their</v>

2420
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:32.520
<v Speaker 2>line and they'd be pulling these fish up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cook them later that night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>is too and how weird it is.</v>

2424
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:43.580

<v Speaker 2>didn't go to the fish market.</v>

2429

<v Speaker 2>The fish market in Tokyo is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a million fish.</v>

2430
01:44:57.111 --> 01:44:58.720
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They liked it.</v>

2431
01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.510
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so,</v>

2432
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:04.130

01:45:08.331 --> 01:45:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like these people like go months </v>
<v Speaker 2>without seeing a piece of bread.</v>

2437
01:45:11.721 --> 01:45:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not in the bread and they're all</v>

2440
01:45:15.110 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 2>They're their noodles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they're rice noodles.</v>

2441
01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 2>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2442
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 2>there's wheat noodles there too though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2443
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat different than us.</v>

2444
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a completely different style </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eating in just.</v>

2445
01:45:26.230 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the coolest things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tokyo man,</v>

2446
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 2>is that it's almost like an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2447
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2448
01:45:33.501 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you mean this city because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2449
01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you're in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2450
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:38.803
<v Speaker 2>You'll leave from Los Angeles and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're here in 2018 and you drive </v>

2451
01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:43.544
<v Speaker 2>it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way people live over here </v>

2452
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.553
<v Speaker 2>and this is how people were in traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how people are when they </v>

2453
01:45:47.721 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>come to the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different places,</v>

2454
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.660
<v Speaker 2>and then you go to Tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2455
01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:51.523
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is also people in 2018 to live in at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same time,</v>

2457
01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:56.900
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

2458
01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody's super polite as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked on the street.</v>

2459
01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no people bumping into anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's yelling at anybody.</v>

2460
01:46:02.541 --> 01:46:05.600
<v Speaker 2>They're very polite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also very Japanese,</v>

2461
01:46:05.630 --> 01:46:06.463
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of people you see are </v>

2462
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Japanese homogeneous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightly integrated,</v>

2463
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:11.091
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2464
01:46:11.091 --> 01:46:12.690
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see some Africans there.</v>

2465
01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:16.160
<v Speaker 2>See some people like us there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly Japanese people.</v>

2466
01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:16.840
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2467
01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.673
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this TV show on Amazon </v>

2468
01:46:19.671 --> 01:46:21.910
<v Speaker 2>called the man in the high castle now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2469
01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically America.</v>

2470
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:27.043
<v Speaker 2>If the Nazis won the war and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner with the Japanese and the </v>

2471
01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Japanese owned California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Northern California,</v>

2472
01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:38.400
<v Speaker 2>and the Nazis on the rest of the country</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Midwest,</v>

2473
01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:41.480
<v Speaker 2>sort of a no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So New York is Nazi,</v>

2474
01:46:41.481 --> 01:46:42.680
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They split it up.</v>

2475
01:46:42.681 --> 01:46:44.870
<v Speaker 2>The but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Japanese.</v>

<v Speaker 6>he's gracious guy.</v>

2481
01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 6>That guy has been in a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was really good.</v>

2482
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>What is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot it.</v>

2483
01:47:03.361 --> 01:47:08.360
<v Speaker 2>The actor's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rufus Rufus.</v>

2484
01:47:08.410 --> 01:47:09.243
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2485
01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.710
<v Speaker 2>is that I say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2486
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 2>it's really good looking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The governor of New York.</v>

2487
01:47:13.741 --> 01:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food for the Arbor group in proofers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The governor of New York pure is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of New York.</v>

2489
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.333
<v Speaker 6>But it's a very interesting show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Basically New York cops wearing Nazi </v>

2491
01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.710
<v Speaker 6>armband.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's still New York cops like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>And it's fascinating how they do the </v>

2495
01:47:33.101 --> 01:47:33.934
<v Speaker 6>show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what's interesting about Japanese </v>

2496

<v Speaker 6>culture and the show is you see the,</v>

2503
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 2>particular in and they don't really like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mix with the Americans.</v>

2504

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the Anglos.</v>

2505

<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2524
01:48:45.501 --> 01:48:50.450
<v Speaker 2>the art direction is really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of not so fine America.</v>

2525
01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.313
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting too is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can still do that in a movie where you </v>

2526
01:48:54.891 --> 01:48:59.510
<v Speaker 2>can still play Nazis as long as they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2527
01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:05.110
<v Speaker 2>the bad people and some historical thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some something that's going on now.</v>

2528
01:49:05.961 --> 01:49:08.600
<v Speaker 2>That's really the only way you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>portray Nazis.</v>

2529
01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not allowed to be a Nazi for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halloween.</v>

2530
01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2531
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Like people have said like people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried it and you get called out for it.</v>

2532
01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Like there's rules now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be</v>

2533
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:22.840
<v Speaker 6>get on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are your.</v>

2534
01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.710
<v Speaker 6>What did your kids go for Halloween?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did they,</v>

2535
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:26.440
<v Speaker 6>do they do that or do they even.</v>

2536
01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.060
<v Speaker 2>It was very adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were Mermaids,</v>

2537
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:34.250
<v Speaker 2>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're dressing up for Halloween,</v>

2538
01:49:34.251 --> 01:49:35.084
<v Speaker 2>you could be so many terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be vampires and werewolves and </v>

2539
01:49:38.751 --> 01:49:40.310
<v Speaker 2>demons and everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2540
01:49:40.311 --> 01:49:41.144
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

2541
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I went to a plastic straw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kingus Khan.</v>

2542
01:49:43.761 --> 01:49:45.380
<v Speaker 2>You can be kingus Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't be Hitler.</v>

2543
01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 6>It could be Saddam Hussein and people </v>
<v Speaker 6>will laugh if yes,</v>

2544
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.870
<v Speaker 6>sit down was saying we got them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got that guy.</v>

2545
01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.300
<v Speaker 6>But if you dress Mengele,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've ruined the party.</v>

2546
01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 6>You dress as Osama bin Laden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That might get your ass kicked,</v>

2547
01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 6>you might get your ass kicked for that </v>
<v Speaker 6>one or that was too soon,</v>

2548
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:07.020
<v Speaker 6>but if you dress like you could probably</v>
<v Speaker 6>dress like a.</v>

2549
01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 6>The president of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that dude's name?</v>

2550
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:12.990
<v Speaker 6>That dude came over here and set a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 6>of crazy shit.</v>

2551
01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.270
<v Speaker 6>Gay People Boucher,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boucher,</v>

2552
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:15.540
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>

2553
01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2554
01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's just talk about it for a second.</v>

2555
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:19.743
<v Speaker 6>I remember when people were offended </v>
<v Speaker 6>that there was an Anne Frank Halloween </v>

2556
01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:24.484
<v Speaker 6>costume.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now if the point of talking about the </v>

2557
01:50:27.521 --> 01:50:28.354
<v Speaker 6>Holocaust or something like that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>never forget and a 14 year old in a non </v>

2558
01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 6>mocking way wants to embody and frank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why is that offensive?</v>

2559
01:50:37.031 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're never going to do it.</v>

2560
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.630
<v Speaker 6>Non Mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2561
01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:42.220
<v Speaker 6>Every time you're making a halloween </v>
<v Speaker 6>costume,</v>

2562
01:50:42.230 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 6>you're almost always trying to be silly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2563
01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:46.980
<v Speaker 6>Frank?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's hiding in the attic.</v>

2564
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:51.100
<v Speaker 6>Halloween Halloweena cost,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know.</v>

2565
01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.950
<v Speaker 6>It all depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>

2566
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:55.660
<v Speaker 6>your intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent.</v>

2567
01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 6>You should be able to wear whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck you want.</v>

2568
01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.473
<v Speaker 6>I never understood when that Prince </v>
<v Speaker 6>Harry got all this shit for dressing </v>

2569
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:02.110
<v Speaker 6>like a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

2570
01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe wait,</v>

2571
01:51:03.731 --> 01:51:06.100
<v Speaker 6>did he dress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like announcing he was dressed for,</v>

2572
01:51:06.101 --> 01:51:09.600
<v Speaker 6>it was a costume party to veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like what,</v>

2573
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:11.200
<v Speaker 6>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why would you do that?</v>

2574
01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:12.573
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it doesn't mean he's glorifying </v>

2575
01:51:14.321 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does it?</v>

2576
01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 6>I guess if he's the prince,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2577
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:21.240
<v Speaker 6>But you could be a Mongol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can be one of the Mongol hoards tour</v>

2578
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:24.250
<v Speaker 6>through Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's also a symbol unto itself.</v>

2579
01:51:24.251 --> 01:51:26.370
<v Speaker 6>He's assemble the English royalty and </v>
<v Speaker 6>all that kind of,</v>

2580
01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.690
<v Speaker 6>I guess because it's hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years later.</v>

2581
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:29.853
<v Speaker 6>But he grew up all right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got out of it that motherfuckers </v>

2582
01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.780
<v Speaker 6>living under a microscope though when he</v>
<v Speaker 6>can get away with,</v>

2583
01:51:34.781 --> 01:51:37.990
<v Speaker 6>but pretty much no one can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 6>being a Nazi anymore.</v>

2584
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.100
<v Speaker 6>There was a guy from North Carolina or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that recently.</v>

2585
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:45.130
<v Speaker 6>Him and his son were Nazis for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for Halloween.</v>

2586
01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:45.964
<v Speaker 6>One person that could get away with it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I can't say too much because we </v>

2587
01:51:48.371 --> 01:51:49.740
<v Speaker 6>haven't released it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2588
01:51:50.050 --> 01:51:53.180
<v Speaker 6>Gilbert godfried so he can get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it.</v>

2589
01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.670
<v Speaker 6>If you're a Jew you can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2590
01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2591
01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:57.243
<v Speaker 6>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2592
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:58.290
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's,</v>

2593
01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone seems to.</v>

2594
01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go ahead and put your right.</v>

2595
01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 6>I mean remember when she did that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She dresses a Nazi.</v>

2596
01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always think that stuff's funny.</v>

2597
01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 6>When I was a 13 year old kid and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>school or grade school,</v>

2598
01:52:12.761 --> 01:52:15.750
<v Speaker 6>learning about the first amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2599
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:16.623
<v Speaker 6>one of the reasons I became a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 6>was because I used to just draw </v>

2600
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:24.470
<v Speaker 6>swastikas on my notebooks just because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because I knew I was like,</v>

2601
01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 6>they would teach us about dictatorships,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I would go,</v>

2602
01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.293
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in any other country they can't do </v>

2603
01:52:29.801 --> 01:52:30.634
<v Speaker 6>this and I would just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make myself smile and then cross it out </v>

2604
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:36.160
<v Speaker 6>and I go in any other country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd get my tongue cut out.</v>

2605
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:37.323
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the beautiful thing is that you </v>

2606
01:52:39.251 --> 01:52:43.210
<v Speaker 6>can say fucked up terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can dress like an asshole.</v>

2607
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:45.600
<v Speaker 6>Like bad taste is not a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2608
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was what one of the,</v>

2609
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:51.410
<v Speaker 5>you remember the Yale uprising a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>of years back,</v>

2610
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:56.860
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Nicholas Greek name and his wife,</v>

2611
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:59.143
<v Speaker 5>they were at Yale and the wife sent out </v>
<v Speaker 5>an email saying that we need to stop </v>

2612
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:07.370
<v Speaker 5>policing people's costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's Halloween costume.</v>

2613
01:53:07.590 --> 01:53:08.423
<v Speaker 5>She got fired and you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>politically incorrect ca halloween </v>

01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:15.270
<v Speaker 5>costume like we should relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people started freaking out.</v>

2615
01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.780
<v Speaker 5>They cornered him in the square or </v>
<v Speaker 5>screaming and nick,</v>

2616
01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:21.980
<v Speaker 5>here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chris Christakis,</v>

2617
01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Christakis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't wanna fuck up.</v>

2618
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.210
<v Speaker 5>So Nicholas Christakis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So uh,</v>

2619
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:26.113
<v Speaker 5>he's a Greek American sociologist and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>physician and he was teaching at Yale </v>

2620
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.903
<v Speaker 5>and these kids were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they confronted them and they were </v>

2621
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:36.710
<v Speaker 5>screaming at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is our safe place.</v>

2622
01:53:36.711 --> 01:53:37.544
<v Speaker 5>You fucking ruined our play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so bizarre and strange and </v>

2623
01:53:41.331 --> 01:53:42.164
<v Speaker 5>hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was just trapped out there with </v>

2624
01:53:44.211 --> 01:53:49.211
<v Speaker 5>these nonsensical kids screaming at him </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's racist and this whole thing is</v>

2625
01:53:49.761 --> 01:53:53.210
<v Speaker 5>racist and he shouldn't be able to wear </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever costume you want.</v>

2626
01:53:53.211 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Like no one even specified like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about.</v>

2627
01:53:56.590 --> 01:53:58.460
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was ethnic costumes that they,</v>

2628
01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.910
<v Speaker 4>that's supposed to appropriate another </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

2629
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Even even though like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2630
01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:03.753
<v Speaker 4>it's just for the party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got Adam and people are just looking </v>

2631
01:54:07.211 --> 01:54:09.970
<v Speaker 4>for a reason to be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to make any sense.</v>

2632
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.990
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the whole idea of like this thing,</v>

2633
01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:17.310
<v Speaker 4>this woke a thing like my niece and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>niece and nephew are going to call,</v>

2634
01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:20.800
<v Speaker 4>you know they're going to get ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to college and I'm like Oh God,</v>

2635
01:54:20.801 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be so difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2636
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:25.090
<v Speaker 4>because they're going to come out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this machine,</v>

2637
01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much looking at me as like,</v>

2638
01:54:27.281 --> 01:54:28.114
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much I'm already not that </v>

2639
01:54:28.811 --> 01:54:29.644
<v Speaker 4>relevant but like just like all of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>references and stuff like that and just </v>

2640
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:34.690
<v Speaker 4>going to be so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inappropriate.</v>

2641
01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:36.693
<v Speaker 4>And it's like when you go to college </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to go to the open your </v>

2642
01:54:38.681 --> 01:54:42.010
<v Speaker 4>mind not to really focus your opinion </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you already have.</v>

2643
01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:46.540
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I felt was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like everybody's like,</v>

2644
01:54:46.541 --> 01:54:47.374
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to play college show and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all dreading the day when we have </v>

2645
01:54:50.021 --> 01:54:52.360
<v Speaker 4>to play a show like that where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2646
01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:54.580
<v Speaker 4>everybody there has that group think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2647
01:54:54.581 --> 01:54:57.440
<v Speaker 4>you have to adapt and you do a dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2648
01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:00.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping to tap tap fine,</v>

2649
01:55:00.071 --> 01:55:00.904
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying like playing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>college and now you probably could do </v>

2650
01:55:02.831 --> 01:55:03.850
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think I could.</v>

2651
01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Of course she could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2652
01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You adapt in terms of doing a set.</v>

2653
01:55:07.991 --> 01:55:09.280
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hate yourself,</v>

2654
01:55:09.281 --> 01:55:11.170
<v Speaker 4>that ride home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't want to do that.</v>

2655
01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.213
<v Speaker 4>What you'd want to just be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to do and it would </v>

2656
01:55:13.991 --> 01:55:15.360
<v Speaker 4>make you want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2657
01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:18.400
<v Speaker 4>so you're not gonna go push it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Offensive or mean.</v>

2658
01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not a bad person.</v>

2659
01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:23.380
<v Speaker 4>So they don't take that into account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the words coming out of your mouth.</v>

2660
01:55:23.381 --> 01:55:25.660
<v Speaker 4>They taking them literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're in this state,</v>

2661
01:55:25.661 --> 01:55:27.310
<v Speaker 4>that we're in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2662
01:55:27.311 --> 01:55:28.144
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll see the irony or the sarcasm in </v>

2663
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:30.703
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sense of humor in this country has </v>

2664
01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:34.480
<v Speaker 4>never been lower and I can say that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like what Jeff's talking about,</v>

2665
01:55:34.481 --> 01:55:35.314
<v Speaker 4>like when we were little kids like </v>
<v Speaker 4>blazing saddles and a young </v>

2666
01:55:37.241 --> 01:55:40.270
<v Speaker 4>Frankenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these movies that everybody was watching</v>

2667
01:55:40.271 --> 01:55:41.104
<v Speaker 4>them enjoying them and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they have all these hidden and </v>

2668
01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 4>people look</v>

2669
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 2>into that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2670
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>it was just a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a fun experience.</v>

2671
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:50.833
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like that was like the </v>

2672
01:55:51.991 --> 01:55:54.900
<v Speaker 2>template for how to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can bounce back,</v>

2673
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:55.734
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's happening now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain number of people that </v>

2674
01:55:59.161 --> 01:55:59.994
<v Speaker 2>want to be able to change the way other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk and what they talk about </v>

2675
01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:04.373
<v Speaker 2>because they are ultra sensitive so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this giant reaction to things that </v>

2676
01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:11.130
<v Speaker 2>may or may not be relevant and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate whether or not it's relevant.</v>

2677
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Some things we've changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2678
01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Like certain words that used to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say easily just a few years ago,</v>

2679
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 2>way hard to get away with saying now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the culture is shifting in a way</v>

2680
01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:21.054
<v Speaker 2>that's becoming more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So probably that's good as long as they </v>

2681
01:56:23.551 --> 01:56:28.551
<v Speaker 2>understand context and intent context </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mel Brooks,</v>

2682
01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:32.340
<v Speaker 2>because he used the n word 50 times in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2683
01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>

2684
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:35.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When my uncle Murray said,</v>

2685
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought,</v>

2686
01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:43.060
<v Speaker 2>when I brought a Chinese girlfriend home</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my pop jack and he's like,</v>

2687
01:56:43.290 --> 01:56:46.770
<v Speaker 2>east is east and West is west and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two shall meet.</v>

2688
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.740
<v Speaker 2>We didn't kick my grandfather out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

2689
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.870
<v Speaker 2>We just said character mine into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

2690
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy grew up like we're watching.</v>

2691
01:56:55.511 --> 01:56:58.290
<v Speaker 2>We're that guy grew up in world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2692
01:56:58.291 --> 01:57:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean that this no one could ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way we're going to understand</v>

2693
01:57:02.770 --> 01:57:05.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference in the way people saw the</v>

2694
01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 2>world that had to deal with an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war two,</v>

2695
01:57:08.641 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 2>this soft pampered ass life we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

2696
01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.413
<v Speaker 2>I don't condone racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand why people hold </v>

2697
01:57:15.151 --> 01:57:15.984
<v Speaker 2>grudges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2698
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:17.603
<v Speaker 2>If you went over to Vietnam and lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>half your fucking friends and you came </v>

2699
01:57:20.191 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 2>back over here and you're fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>still because of it.</v>

2700
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:24.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't condone racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that anytime you're forced </v>

2701
01:57:26.861 --> 01:57:30.510
<v Speaker 2>into a situation where your country is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at war with another side,</v>

2702
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:33.090
<v Speaker 2>it's probably really hard for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive people.</v>

2703
01:57:33.110 --> 01:57:33.931
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2704
01:57:33.931 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how.</v>

2705
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.273
<v Speaker 2>How hard is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things that someone </v>

2706
01:57:36.361 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 2>said about the Japanese and not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>too thrilled with Americans and I said,</v>

2707
01:57:39.691 --> 01:57:40.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

2708
01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.433
<v Speaker 2>How do you think you'd feel if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up 40 years after someone had </v>

2709
01:57:45.511 --> 01:57:46.344
<v Speaker 2>literally nuked your country twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just annihilated hundreds of thousands </v>

2710
01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:53.680
<v Speaker 2>of people with one bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2711
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:54.523
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made shadows on the concrete of where </v>

2712
01:57:56.341 --> 01:57:59.100
<v Speaker 2>someone's body used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just vaporize them.</v>

2713
01:57:59.101 --> 01:58:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

2714
01:58:00.001 --> 01:58:00.900
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandma,</v>

2715
01:58:00.901 --> 01:58:02.220
<v Speaker 2>grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets it.</v>

2716
01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2717
01:58:03.931 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is going to be nice after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2718
01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.400
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to forget that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2719
01:58:08.710 --> 01:58:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Who is that baseball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese baseball guy.</v>

2720
01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:12.600
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2721
01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:13.434
<v Speaker 2>That got to negotiate that into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract and you've got to give me a </v>

2722
01:58:15.631 --> 01:58:20.631
<v Speaker 2>little extra for Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reparation little things.</v>

2723
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:21.803
<v Speaker 2>They did it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America doesn't give itself enough shit </v>

2724
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:27.360
<v Speaker 2>for having the interment camps here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been on one of those.</v>

2725
01:58:27.361 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>There's one up on a Washington state on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bainbridge island,</v>

2726
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:33.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one on Bainbridge island.</v>

2727
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bainbridge is beautiful.</v>

2728
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you to determine camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2729
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't Jesus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not all and we got into that</v>

2730
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.880
<v Speaker 6>war late,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2731
01:58:42.881 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 6>We don't give ourselves enough shit for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that either.</v>

2732
01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:47.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it once in.</v>

2733
01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:52.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm the guy from Star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2734
01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:53.480
<v Speaker 5>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't he?</v>

2735
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:54.343
<v Speaker 5>It was his name.</v>

2736
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:56.430
<v Speaker 6>George George.</v>
<v Speaker 6>George Guy.</v>

2737
01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.680
<v Speaker 6>He's a survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He lived in a Japanese internment camp.</v>

2738
01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:04.220
<v Speaker 6>It was a little kid and for FDR was </v>
<v Speaker 6>president for four terms.</v>

2739
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.203
<v Speaker 6>Isn't it crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's he really president for four </v>

2740
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:08.803
<v Speaker 6>term?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He died in a year and it was fourth </v>

2741
01:59:10.041 --> 01:59:11.380
<v Speaker 6>term.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How can you share about that?</v>

2742
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:12.223
<v Speaker 6>Was it for three?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it definitely was more than three </v>

2743
01:59:13.611 --> 01:59:15.530
<v Speaker 6>and then he got elected and they stopped</v>
<v Speaker 6>after that.</v>

2744
01:59:15.531 --> 01:59:17.050
<v Speaker 6>They will like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can only be two,</v>

2745
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:18.410
<v Speaker 6>but I bet you that are going to.</v>

2746
01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

2747
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:25.450
<v Speaker 5>If you had a great president though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I want to keep doing this job.</v>

2748
01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Speaker 5>Did that awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>CEO of Google,</v>

2749
01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.870
<v Speaker 5>like kicking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you got to step it down,</v>

2750
01:59:31.871 --> 01:59:33.520
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only eight years,</v>

2751
01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:36.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the only gig where when you're</v>

2752
01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.960
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has so much power.</v>

2753
01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:40.030
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just can't keep running this.</v>

2754
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:43.120
<v Speaker 5>You got to give up the reins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody has to give up the reins.</v>

2755
01:59:43.210 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 5>We'd never let the best person to run it</v>
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>

2756
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 5>You would think once Clinton got ahead </v>
<v Speaker 5>of steam under him,</v>

2757
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just feed is carnal desires and just</v>

2758
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:54.420
<v Speaker 6>quarterback.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2759
01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.950
<v Speaker 6>you're only gonna have a few good years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seasons.</v>

2760
01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:57.873
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how many years do you think the </v>

2761
01:59:59.231 --> 02:00:00.064
<v Speaker 5>public would have kept him in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you had a guy like Barack </v>

2762
02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 5>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many years,</v>

2763
02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 5>if they just let them go until he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to do it anymore,</v>

2764
02:00:07.391 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 5>until we don't want them to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

2765
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 5>How many years you think you keep doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2766
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.823
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might be able to do it for four or </v>

2767
02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:13.713
<v Speaker 5>five terms maybe more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if it showed that his </v>

2768
02:00:16.691 --> 02:00:17.524
<v Speaker 5>policies were working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you know a lot of these </v>

2769
02:00:18.641 --> 02:00:20.290
<v Speaker 5>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>economic policies,</v>

2770
02:00:20.291 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 5>they take years in order to see real </v>
<v Speaker 5>world benefits.</v>

2771
02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:24.773
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you take the actual campaigning out </v>

2772
02:00:26.521 --> 02:00:27.360
<v Speaker 6>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2773
02:00:27.570 --> 02:00:28.403
<v Speaker 6>they're really only president for two </v>
<v Speaker 6>years because it's like they're </v>

2774
02:00:29.791 --> 02:00:30.624
<v Speaker 6>campaigning on the way in and then the </v>
<v Speaker 6>campaigning on the way out and it's </v>

2775
02:00:32.821 --> 02:00:33.481
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2776
02:00:33.481 --> 02:00:34.314
<v Speaker 6>that's for all of our government and </v>
<v Speaker 6>like we're all like I guess victims of </v>

2777
02:00:37.351 --> 02:00:38.930
<v Speaker 6>that so sad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but calender,</v>

2778
02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:42.820
<v Speaker 5>trying to explain it the other day about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of time that a congressman or</v>

2779
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:43.654
<v Speaker 5>senator or any politician spends raising</v>
<v Speaker 5>money versus the amount of time that </v>

2780
02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:49.960
<v Speaker 5>they spend actually doing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's not even close</v>

2781
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.750
<v Speaker 6>and it's so humbling that their job is </v>
<v Speaker 6>awesome.</v>

2782
02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:53.613
<v Speaker 6>We see them on cspan banging a gavel and</v>
<v Speaker 6>making a point and handing out a metal </v>

2783
02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:58.624
<v Speaker 6>to a soldier and then you go see an </v>
<v Speaker 6>actual political fundraiser and it's </v>

2784
02:01:02.191 --> 02:01:03.024
<v Speaker 6>like boring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like cory booker standing on a </v>

2785
02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.273
<v Speaker 6>basement floor at canter's on a Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 6>morning and there's no glamor to it at </v>

2786
02:01:11.711 --> 02:01:12.420
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

2787
02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:16.970
<v Speaker 6>They have the worst gig ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I took you to,</v>

2788
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:18.263
<v Speaker 6>if we were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the three of us had to show up where </v>

2789
02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.350
<v Speaker 6>politicians have to show up to raise </v>
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

2790
02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:25.930
<v Speaker 6>You'd be screaming at your age and </v>
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

2791
02:01:25.931 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 6>are you fucking kidding me with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>microphone?</v>

2792
02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:28.864
<v Speaker 6>And there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no lights and no one could hear </v>

2793
02:01:30.371 --> 02:01:33.950
<v Speaker 6>me and I'm fucking talking to a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no food.</v>

2794
02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:36.140
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't starve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like the worst.</v>

2795
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:42.490
<v Speaker 6>That is a could see why anybody would do</v>
<v Speaker 6>this fricken job of,</v>

2796
02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:48.470
<v Speaker 6>of trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to try to help people.</v>

2797
02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to expose.</v>

2798
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:53.130
<v Speaker 6>You are going to beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to go at all your busy,</v>

2799
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:54.283
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But trump was the only one that did it </v>

2800
02:01:55.911 --> 02:01:58.580
<v Speaker 6>with a built in giant audience right </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the jump.</v>

2801
02:01:59.140 --> 02:01:59.973
<v Speaker 6>Like right from the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had a giant audience going crazy </v>

2802
02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:05.840
<v Speaker 6>tours on our dime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If Hillary right now,</v>

2803
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:09.770
<v Speaker 6>real housewives instead of the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she would've been president.</v>

2804
02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:13.130
<v Speaker 6>She had just feed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mentioned seeing Hillary bill around</v>

2805
02:02:13.131 --> 02:02:13.964
<v Speaker 6>the house.</v>

2806
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:19.760
<v Speaker 6>Famous for just being a lady sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>being a politician.</v>

2807
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:21.253
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She probably would have and in some </v>

2808
02:02:22.701 --> 02:02:23.241
<v Speaker 6>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2809
02:02:23.241 --> 02:02:26.450
<v Speaker 6>She was almost like hindered by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 6>that she was Bill Clinton's wife.</v>

2810
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.883
<v Speaker 6>If she was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a senator by herself with a lawyer who </v>

2811
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:32.324
<v Speaker 6>became a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she probably would have way more of a </v>

2812
02:02:34.101 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 6>shot of winning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Same Person.</v>

2813
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:37.910
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People always say,</v>

2814
02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what did bill,</v>

2815
02:02:39.610 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 6>what did trump do for the working man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He entertained them.</v>

2816
02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:47.060
<v Speaker 6>Like show is great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People love that show.</v>

<v Speaker 6>watching Monday night football and </v>

2877
02:05:04.261 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 6>cosell just changes mood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden the music,</v>

2878
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:12.900
<v Speaker 6>Beatles legend John Lennon and I thought</v>

<v Speaker 6>like it's the enemy of the people.</v>

2974
02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:20.710

2980
02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.740
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't go past an iphone too.</v>

2981
02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:36.750
<v Speaker 6>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>how many articles compared to Jv burst?</v>

2986
02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:47.860
<v Speaker 6>How many iphones compared to how many </v>
<v Speaker 6>rocky movies are there?</v>

2987
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:51.143
<v Speaker 6>Rocky movies are there now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] name is Hobie rockies </v>

2988
02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:57.310
<v Speaker 6>because now we have d dos creeds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The second thing act now,</v>

2989
02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.300
<v Speaker 6>like I say it is because it's working </v>
<v Speaker 6>off of the actual narrative of rocky.</v>

2990
02:10:01.610 --> 02:10:04.210
<v Speaker 6>Do you hear Michael b?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jordan is talking about boxing.</v>

2991
02:10:04.211 --> 02:10:05.710
<v Speaker 6>Roy Jones Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:10:05.711 --> 02:10:07.870
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was a cool kind of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a joke.</v>

2993
02:10:07.871 --> 02:10:09.580
<v Speaker 6>Just straight up boxing and not like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>meu moitai.</v>

2994
02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:11.500
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't do that michael.</v>

2995
02:10:11.590 --> 02:10:14.950
<v Speaker 6>Just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he's a great athlete.</v>

2996
02:10:15.010 --> 02:10:17.260
<v Speaker 6>He's a beautiful kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has got a great bodY.</v>

2997
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 6>It looks like he knows how to box when </v>
<v Speaker 6>he throws punches.</v>

2998
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:21.160
<v Speaker 6>It looks like you really actually knows </v>
<v Speaker 6>how to box.</v>

2999
02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:23.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he's a really good athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's built like a brick shithouse,</v>

3000
02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:27.330
<v Speaker 6>but boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Roy jones jr is a pastor.</v>

3001
02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:32.170
<v Speaker 6>Someone that had to get hit upside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll never work again or you'll become</v>

3002
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:32.721
<v Speaker 6>a box.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:10:32.721 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 6>You hang in there with them and you</v>

3004
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.530
<v Speaker 2>look like your hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

3005
02:10:35.531 --> 02:10:37.820
<v Speaker 2>You clip them and hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is.</v>

3006
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It is a humanly possible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3007
02:10:40.670 --> 02:10:41.503
<v Speaker 2>Like when two people throwing punches at</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other that one of them could hit </v>

3008
02:10:43.311 --> 02:10:47.430
<v Speaker 2>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the downside is ruined.</v>

3009
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:48.343
<v Speaker 2>Boy jones is one of the greatest boxers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time and still to this day knows </v>

3010
02:10:55.221 --> 02:10:59.090
<v Speaker 2>how to box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he forgot he's pushing 50,</v>

3011
02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:00.420
<v Speaker 2>49.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3012
02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:03.330
<v Speaker 2>he's pushing 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think somebody,</v>

3013
02:11:03.570 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 2>someone who's like deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just talking shit.</v>

3014
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 2>He was just probably being asked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would you like to box?</v>

3015
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Who is your hero and how many rounds to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go certain amount.</v>

3016
02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 2>What exactly happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he would.</v>

3017
02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>He asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would you want to fight today?</v>

3018
02:11:18.261 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones,</v>

3019
02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:22.630
<v Speaker 2>he would probably beat me in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd probably find them today.</v>

3020
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.040
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just like that is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>outrageous thing to say.</v>

3021
02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Just an asshole thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George foreman.</v>

3022
02:11:27.590 --> 02:11:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably would kill you in his prime </v>

3023
02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.070
<v Speaker 2>when the idea that he would just beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean Roy Jones jr.</v>

3024
02:11:34.071 --> 02:11:37.010
<v Speaker 2>When he was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would Just waiting to see.</v>

<v Speaker 2>People forgot how good Roy Jones jr was.</v>

3028

<v Speaker 2>and then knocking people out.</v>

3081
02:13:58.431 --> 02:13:59.264
<v Speaker 5>the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's such a giant difference between </v>

3082
02:14:02.061 --> 02:14:04.780
<v Speaker 5>learning how to box and being a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete.</v>

3083
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:07.490
<v Speaker 5>He clearly is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And being Roy Jones jr,</v>

3084
02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.250
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gap is so wide.</v>

3085
02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:14.030
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like if I did a movie about playing</v>

3086
02:14:14.031 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 5>basketball and then I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3087
02:14:16.610 --> 02:14:18.370
<v Speaker 5>play a one on one versus coby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

3088
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:19.630
<v Speaker 5>you'll have been planning this movie for</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of.</v>

3089
02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:24.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm feeling good even though I never did</v>
<v Speaker 6>any competitive basketball player.</v>

3090
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:27.410
<v Speaker 6>You were in the white shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like He got beat up.</v>

3091
02:14:27.411 --> 02:14:30.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a movie star brown.</v>

3092
02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:33.290
<v Speaker 6>He's got fake blood on his whelks that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was in the movie.</v>

3093
02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:35.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he knows how to throw his </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>

3094
02:14:35.291 --> 02:14:37.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He looks good in the movies.</v>

3095
02:14:37.151 --> 02:14:38.380
<v Speaker 5>He looks like he really knows what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

3096
02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:41.980
<v Speaker 5>but Roy Jones jr is one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>of all time.</v>

3097
02:14:42.190 --> 02:14:43.023
<v Speaker 5>He was a female.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows how to box in a way that you </v>

3098
02:14:46.301 --> 02:14:49.420
<v Speaker 5>never going to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how long has he been simply boxed?</v>

3099
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:50.343
<v Speaker 5>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Roy Jones had a fight within the </v>

3100
02:14:52.061 --> 02:14:55.900
<v Speaker 5>last two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think his last fight was,</v>

3101
02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.120
<v Speaker 5>I wanna say it was two less than two </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

3102
02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.570
<v Speaker 5>I think he retired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a bunch of fights over in Russia.</v>

3103
02:15:01.571 --> 02:15:05.530
<v Speaker 5>He actually became a russian citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that it?</v>

3104
02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:08.110
<v Speaker 5>This year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus christ place some of it.</v>

3105
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a retired boxer.</v>

3106
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:14.890
<v Speaker 5>Challenging a box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Roy Jones jr.</v>

3107
02:15:14.891 --> 02:15:17.830
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just this is a different thing.</v>

3108
02:15:17.831 --> 02:15:18.664
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing if you're like a top </v>
<v Speaker 5>level pro right now and you feel like </v>

3109
02:15:21.941 --> 02:15:23.850
<v Speaker 5>you would have got knocked out by ryan </v>
<v Speaker 5>is probably,</v>

3110
02:15:23.851 --> 02:15:25.270
<v Speaker 5>but you can give them a goal right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3111
02:15:25.271 --> 02:15:26.310
<v Speaker 5>that I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is.</v>

3112
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:28.980
<v Speaker 5>That's believable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a professional boxer.</v>

3113
02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:32.800
<v Speaker 5>You've been honing your craft in the gym</v>
<v Speaker 5>for years and years.</v>

3114
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:34.960
<v Speaker 5>You've been sparring and work with high </v>
<v Speaker 5>level coaches.</v>

3115
02:15:34.961 --> 02:15:37.570
<v Speaker 5>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's still Roy Jones jr.</v>

3116
02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 5>Still Roy Jones jr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though he's 40,</v>

3117
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:46.180
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter if he's boxing one's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxer,</v>

3118
02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:50.260
<v Speaker 5>but Roy Jones is in a boxing match here </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's looking good.</v>

3119
02:15:50.890 --> 02:15:51.723
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's obviously not fighting a guy who's </v>

3120
02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:54.033
<v Speaker 5>the best.</v>

3121
02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.920
<v Speaker 6>Roy jones jr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you call your your agent right now?</v>

3122
02:15:58.470 --> 02:16:00.060
<v Speaker 6>Serious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the money?</v>

3123
02:16:00.370 --> 02:16:01.920
<v Speaker 6>He's already been doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>interviews.</v>

3124
02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:02.381
<v Speaker 6>Just said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3125
02:16:02.381 --> 02:16:04.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get out of bed early in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the morning,</v>

3126
02:16:04.091 --> 02:16:06.070
<v Speaker 6>but if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he wants to really do this,</v>

3127
02:16:06.071 --> 02:16:06.904
<v Speaker 6>we could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it'd be a wonderful opportunity </v>

3128
02:16:10.511 --> 02:16:11.920
<v Speaker 6>to show people what boxing is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3129
02:16:11.921 --> 02:16:14.170
<v Speaker 6>let me see what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would love to see that here.</v>

3130
02:16:14.290 --> 02:16:17.710
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what roy says.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course I saw the video.</v>

3131
02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:23.180
<v Speaker 6>Birthing is a duct to fight in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>NothIng right now.</v>

3132
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:29.470
<v Speaker 6>Hurricane to come down here so ain't </v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody real content</v>

3133
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.950
<v Speaker 9>and we will make happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You got my number.</v>

3134
02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.480
<v Speaker 9>He can cut you and get my number.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there's no question about high.</v>

3135
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:43.820
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>
<v Speaker 9>From tmc.</v>

3136
02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:44.873
<v Speaker 9>The list may happen</v>

3137
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:46.400
<v Speaker 10>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He said in the video,</v>

3138
02:16:46.401 --> 02:16:49.250
<v Speaker 10>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think he would probably have killed me</v>

3139
02:16:49.251 --> 02:16:53.170
<v Speaker 10>back in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's true though.</v>

3140
02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:57.550
<v Speaker 10>Do you actually many kids beat you now </v>
<v Speaker 10>even though you are 49 boy.</v>

3141
02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:01.400
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can't beat me still because I mean I</v>

3142
02:17:01.401 --> 02:17:03.410
<v Speaker 9>know he's probably a better condition </v>
<v Speaker 9>because he's younger.</v>

3143
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.680
<v Speaker 9>He probably think he can go longer and </v>
<v Speaker 9>probably thinks he might be able to even</v>

3144
02:17:06.681 --> 02:17:10.640
<v Speaker 9>at working now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I'm a bit old.</v>

3145
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:15.210
<v Speaker 9>School ain't going out like that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love you.</v>

3146
02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:17.830
<v Speaker 9>Understand me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So opened unstable box.</v>

3147
02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:18.713
<v Speaker 9>We'll just take them out right away </v>
<v Speaker 9>because then you don't get the </v>

3148
02:17:21.051 --> 02:17:23.900
<v Speaker 9>experience with box.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a professional like I am,</v>

3149
02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.570
<v Speaker 9>and I know you big and strong because </v>
<v Speaker 9>you've got strong for the movie.</v>

3150
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:28.670
<v Speaker 9>Then I should be able to avoid all of </v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

3151
02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:30.183
<v Speaker 9>Take them into deep water so you </v>
<v Speaker 9>understand what a boxing match release </v>

3152
02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:34.430
<v Speaker 9>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He don't want to say,</v>

3153
02:17:34.431 --> 02:17:35.120
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've got.</v>

3154
02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:36.360
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

3155
02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:36.801
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

3156
02:17:36.801 --> 02:17:39.500
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a nice five,</v>

3157
02:17:39.501 --> 02:17:40.334
<v Speaker 9>six rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I want you to see how it really </v>

3158
02:17:41.691 --> 02:17:42.524
<v Speaker 9>feels.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So that's why I'm talking like that now </v>

3159
02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:46.490
<v Speaker 9>because I think he can really match my </v>
<v Speaker 9>skills.</v>

3160
02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:48.230
<v Speaker 9>I really don't even that for tonight.</v>

3161
02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 10>How long would you need to get right to </v>
<v Speaker 10>where you could step in there?</v>

3162
02:17:51.761 --> 02:17:52.594
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what's the soonest we could make this </v>

3163
02:17:53.291 --> 02:17:54.124
<v Speaker 10>fight happen?</v>

3164
02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:55.573
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>probably for him about four or five </v>

3165
02:17:58.531 --> 02:17:59.364
<v Speaker 9>weeks.</v>

3166
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please listen to me.</v>

3167
02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone called stubhub.</v>

3168
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Just don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

3169
02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:09.770
<v Speaker 2>This is not gonna work out well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're,</v>

3170
02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I would assume both of them are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be drug tested.</v>

3171
02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think either one of them wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pee in a bucket.</v>

3172
02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:21.930
<v Speaker 2>If they just let roy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let roy go to dr feelgood,</v>

3173
02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:24.800
<v Speaker 2>pump them up with hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be a route.</v>

3174
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:28.790
<v Speaker 2>This would be terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine getting a call from his agent,</v>

3175
02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:30.530
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an offer for you to do this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>guys who was picked or an astronaut.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Navy seals,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to say it.</v>

3185
02:18:58.841 --> 02:18:59.674

<v Speaker 2>if he was on the plane with five versus </v>

3186

<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he really say that though?</v>

3187
02:19:04.850 --> 02:19:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never heard him say the things.</v>

3188
02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:09.670

3190
02:19:13.521 --> 02:19:16.100
<v Speaker 5>do if you thought that you were just </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to land somewhere.</v>

3191
02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:17.693
<v Speaker 5>Now that's the idea is that you knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>what was gonna happen before it </v>

3192
02:19:19.401 --> 02:19:20.810
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that shit's going down.</v>

3194
02:19:21.621 --> 02:19:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Someone's got box cutters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were holding the waitress.</v>

3195
02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:25.790
<v Speaker 5>They're holding a stewardess by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>neck,</v>

3196
02:19:25.791 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what fuck's happening.</v>

3197
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:31.260
<v Speaker 5>You have no idea what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're afraid to move and you know,</v>

3198
02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:33.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that a lot of people would step</v>
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

3199
02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:36.350
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could potentially cost that person in</v>

3200
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:40.700
<v Speaker 5>their life and then when the plane </v>
<v Speaker 5>lands,</v>

3201
02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:43.670
<v Speaker 5>that person's dead when they may be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know,</v>

3202
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:45.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know the actual scenario.</v>

3203
02:19:45.201 --> 02:19:48.410
<v Speaker 5>Now obviously we know was a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and you should do whatever you can</v>

3204
02:19:48.411 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 5>to stop them because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill everybody no matter what.</v>

3205
02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 5>But back then you didn't know what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>

3206
02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 5>If someone just took the plane and </v>
<v Speaker 5>landed in the stewardess,</v>

3207
02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 5>he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>glad I didn't do anything.</v>

3208
02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:01.100
<v Speaker 5>She jumped up and he cut her face off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3209
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 5>it's like in those moments when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what's going to happen to.</v>

3210
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:07.730
<v Speaker 5>I was on that plane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3211
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:11.150
<v Speaker 5>With my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the window went down like it did.</v>

3212
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:14.720
<v Speaker 5>That would have been a lot of blood in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that first class cabin.</v>

3213
02:20:14.721 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 5>Then me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3214
02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:18.230
<v Speaker 5>we're going to land somewhere safely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry.</v>

3215
02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See I,</v>

3216
02:20:22.970 --> 02:20:24.710
<v Speaker 5>I see where he's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3217
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:26.810
<v Speaker 5>He's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got kids that he loves.</v>

3218
02:20:26.811 --> 02:20:29.060
<v Speaker 5>He's got a family that he loves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't have said still.</v>

3219
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 5>That's what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:31.633
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then in his mind he probably has </v>

3221
02:20:32.961 --> 02:20:33.794
<v Speaker 5>that conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if it meant the thing that winning </v>

3222
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:38.470
<v Speaker 5>everybody's life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you know,</v>

3223
02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.720
<v Speaker 5>would it work if it didn't work?</v>

3224
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Like what do they have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what they have?</v>

3225
02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:43.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know.</v>

3226
02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a box cutter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have anything else?</v>

3227
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:47.380
<v Speaker 5>How many of them are there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know.</v>

3228
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.330
<v Speaker 5>Is anybody going to back you up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody else know how to fight?</v>

3229
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.640
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could get fucked up.</v>

3230
02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:53.474
<v Speaker 5>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could step up thinking you'Re billy </v>

3231
02:20:54.981 --> 02:20:55.814
<v Speaker 5>bad ass and this guy is some train the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trainers who smashes your face in and </v>

3232
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:03.920
<v Speaker 5>cuts you up with a box cutter that could</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen to.</v>

3233
02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:06.740
<v Speaker 5>It still pulls his belt off the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could.</v>

3234
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows matt the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why there's professionals,</v>

3235
02:21:10.101 --> 02:21:11.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where there's professional.</v>

3236
02:21:11.571 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 5>Those air marshals can assess the </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation and figure out and obviously,</v>

3237
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:16.783
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they weren't either they weren't there </v>

3238
02:21:18.411 --> 02:21:19.730
<v Speaker 5>on that plane or they couldn't help.</v>

3239
02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:22.220
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking about if I was in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>position,</v>

3240
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:23.030
<v Speaker 6>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3241
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:24.020
<v Speaker 6>how could you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3242
02:21:24.021 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck knows what you would do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3243
02:21:25.761 --> 02:21:29.910
<v Speaker 6>since I look like I'm on the other team,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would've said my friends.</v>

3244
02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:38.540
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>

3245
02:21:38.541 --> 02:21:39.570
<v Speaker 6>get up and do your.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3246
02:21:39.571 --> 02:21:42.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm not part of the team.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do your foreign guy.</v>

3247
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:21:45.651 --> 02:21:46.620
<v Speaker 6>You'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3249
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:49.520
<v Speaker 6>I've never been so scared that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>frozen instance for a second.</v>

3250
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.891
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3251
02:21:50.891 --> 02:21:51.724
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't know what the right thing to </v>

3252
02:21:54.111 --> 02:21:57.230
<v Speaker 5>do is in the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be so catastrophic.</v>

3253
02:21:57.231 --> 02:21:58.064
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3254
02:22:00.930 --> 02:22:01.763
<v Speaker 6>As far as to say that he's making </v>
<v Speaker 6>announcements on the plane and this is </v>

3255
02:22:05.471 --> 02:22:09.340
<v Speaker 6>all happening like brittle landing safe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's now the pilot in the movies,</v>

3256
02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:12.880
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true movie.</v>

3257
02:22:12.881 --> 02:22:15.010
<v Speaker 6>You get to grant the intercom at the end</v>
<v Speaker 6>and go,</v>

3258
02:22:15.011 --> 02:22:16.980
<v Speaker 6>thanks for flying solo and solera.</v>

3259
02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:17.883
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you say things like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's how you feel and you </v>

3260
02:22:19.871 --> 02:22:21.640
<v Speaker 5>don't think about how other people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to perceive it.</v>

3261
02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:23.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what I would assume that </v>
<v Speaker 5>statement is.</v>

3262
02:22:23.381 --> 02:22:25.230
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of how he felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>

3263
02:22:25.231 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm landing this fucking plane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm killing the fucking terrorists.</v>

3264
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3265
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:30.520
<v Speaker 6>that's what he told his kids one night.</v>

3266
02:22:30.690 --> 02:22:31.523
<v Speaker 5>The problem is you're saying that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>billions of people and billions of </v>

3267
02:22:33.961 --> 02:22:35.310
<v Speaker 5>people hear that and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3268
02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:38.700
<v Speaker 5>And then all these people get to assess </v>
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>

3269
02:22:38.701 --> 02:22:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Your statement whether or not it has any</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes any sense.</v>

3270
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can kick everybody's ass.</v>

3271
02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:45.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3272
02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:48.313
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of dudes who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they were there and you try to do </v>

3273
02:22:50.221 --> 02:22:51.450
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd get smashed.</v>

3274
02:22:51.770 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 5>Like they're scary people in this world </v>
<v Speaker 5>than weapons on him.</v>

3275
02:22:56.430 --> 02:22:58.230
<v Speaker 5>I would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're ready to die like that,</v>

3276
02:22:58.231 --> 02:22:59.064
<v Speaker 5>you have a very strange kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conviction to if you know you're ready </v>

3277
02:23:02.311 --> 02:23:06.180
<v Speaker 5>to die and you know how to fight like </v>
<v Speaker 5>woo Jesus.</v>

3278
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's</v>

3279
02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:10.643
<v Speaker 11>Just</v>

3280
02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:12.770
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you would have to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

3281
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.690
<v Speaker 5>That's what's really terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

3282
02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:16.730
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you would have to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3283
02:23:16.731 --> 02:23:18.980
<v Speaker 5>what do I do if something is someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>does.</v>

3284
02:23:18.981 --> 02:23:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Hi,</v>

3285
02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:20.860
<v Speaker 6>don't we all think that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3286
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.943
<v Speaker 6>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every situation now there's what we do </v>

3287
02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:25.553
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do.</v>

3288
02:23:26.170 --> 02:23:27.003
<v Speaker 5>Do you hear people run and they survive </v>
<v Speaker 5>and people run and get shot down and </v>

3289
02:23:30.611 --> 02:23:35.420
<v Speaker 5>they go to the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anytime a tragedy like that happen,</v>

3290
02:23:35.490 --> 02:23:36.323
<v Speaker 5>like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horrific random Set of sequences and </v>

3291
02:23:40.601 --> 02:23:41.710
<v Speaker 5>you're in the wrong spot.</v>

3292
02:23:42.610 --> 02:23:44.080
<v Speaker 6>You can do the right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Heroic.</v>

3293
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:47.320
<v Speaker 6>How about how many people must do the </v>
<v Speaker 6>heroic thing and then you die anyway.</v>

3294
02:23:47.321 --> 02:23:48.910
<v Speaker 6>You never know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It seems like those fucking things are </v>

3299
02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:04.400
<v Speaker 5>happening more and more lately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

3300
02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Is the rate more accelerated now than </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's ever been before,</v>

3301
02:24:08.411 --> 02:24:10.750
<v Speaker 5>as well as the numbers of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>shootings and shit.</v>

3302
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

<v Speaker 5>keeps happening?</v>

3304
02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:20.820
<v Speaker 5>If they happened like every couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>days there's like a little one,</v>

3305
02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 5>like a two or three people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3306
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:24.150
<v Speaker 5>she's like not that big a deal anymore.</v>

3307
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:27.540
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what it was when it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>about knives and swords.</v>

3308
02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:31.260
<v Speaker 6>People would go on a killing spree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now it's,</v>

3309
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 6>You kill more people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not everybody would die with a knife.</v>

3310
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:41.450
<v Speaker 5>London.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a bunch of knife attacks,</v>

3311
02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:44.410
<v Speaker 5>london has so many knife attacks that </v>
<v Speaker 5>their uh,</v>

3312
02:24:44.810 --> 02:24:45.643
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their murder rate exceeded New York </v>

3313
02:24:47.841 --> 02:24:50.190
<v Speaker 5>city's murder rate with just knives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3314
02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>google that.</v>

3315
02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Make sure that true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The machete attack,</v>

3316
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.650
<v Speaker 5>the fucking president or the mayor of </v>
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>

3317
02:24:57.651 --> 02:25:01.070
<v Speaker 5>the mayor of london saying something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they won't tolerate knives anymore.</v>

3318
02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Can't have knives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds sounds better.</v>

3319
02:25:04.490 --> 02:25:05.440
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's like that</v>

3320
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:06.663
<v Speaker 6>in New York know knives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have a guy who's a off his meds and </v>

3321
02:25:09.281 --> 02:25:11.410
<v Speaker 6>he's just like walking around with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hammer.</v>

3322
02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.790
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it could happen,</v>

3323
02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:14.560
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't really matter what the weapon</v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

3324
02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:15.853
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>London has overtaken New York for </v>

3325
02:25:17.121 --> 02:25:18.800
<v Speaker 5>murders for the first time in modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

3326
02:25:18.801 --> 02:25:21.830
<v Speaker 5>after a surge of knife crime's across </v>
<v Speaker 5>the capital verdict,</v>

3327
02:25:21.831 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>though selective of statistics</v>

3328
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 2>from the start of 2018 appeared to bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>this out.</v>

3329
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:30.250
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is that New York still </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be more violent than london.</v>

3330
02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was written.</v>

3331
02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It was written by a new yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

3332
02:25:35.771 --> 02:25:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

3333
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:38.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York is on fire.</v>

3334
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love it.</v>

3335
02:25:40.021 --> 02:25:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been there as much in the last</v>

3336
02:25:43.470 --> 02:25:44.303
<v Speaker 1>few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm there and all summer I was </v>

3337
02:25:45.091 --> 02:25:46.320
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love the way you're living your life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You just fly here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly there.</v>

3340
02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to his houses or have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to?</v>

3341
02:25:54.690 --> 02:25:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I've seen photos of the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The la one is awesome.</v>

3342
02:25:57.931 --> 02:25:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The New York one is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3343
02:25:59.670 --> 02:26:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump he.</v>

3344
02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:03.690
<v Speaker 1>You could tell like he doesn't live </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3345
02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a crash pad,</v>

3346
02:26:06.481 --> 02:26:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3347
02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:09.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it isn't,</v>

3348
02:26:10.290 --> 02:26:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's an old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York building with the elevator with</v>

3349
02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the guy has to use the elevator operator</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

3350
02:26:16.290 --> 02:26:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Fancy snobby fifth avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co up Mr.</v>

3351
02:26:20.610 --> 02:26:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Ross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snobby.</v>

3352
02:26:23.131 --> 02:26:23.964
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3353
02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I had to go through a co op interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy hackett wrote my recommendation.</v>

3354
02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

3355
02:26:32.371 --> 02:26:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It's all rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many permits.</v>

3356
02:26:34.291 --> 02:26:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3357
02:26:34.890 --> 02:26:37.650
<v Speaker 1>out god is tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's shootings,</v>

3358
02:26:37.651 --> 02:26:39.990
<v Speaker 1>there's fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the caravan turn back.</v>

3359
02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:41.763
<v Speaker 1>Does that one,</v>

3360
02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:43.313
<v Speaker 2>do you see the photos of people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>running towards the border and gas </v>

3361
02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:48.164
<v Speaker 2>coming out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and the whole idea of like knowing </v>

3362
02:26:50.661 --> 02:26:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that there's a big group of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed towards the border.</v>

3363
02:26:53.001 --> 02:26:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

3364
02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>

3365
02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:57.470
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's people are flinging?</v>

3366
02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:00.740
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what they are leaving to come to</v>

3367
02:27:00.741 --> 02:27:01.910
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3368
02:27:01.911 --> 02:27:02.860
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3369
02:27:03.210 --> 02:27:04.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine what's at home,</v>

3370
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:08.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's always playing that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this planned out event.</v>

3371
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody's watching the migration </v>
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>

3372
02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.410
<v Speaker 2>The board this ever happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3373
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:18.450
<v Speaker 2>There was something that someone posted </v>
<v Speaker 2>about obama in 2013.</v>

3374
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.903
<v Speaker 2>The deal during the obama administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like obama was fucking tear gas </v>

3375
02:27:22.971 --> 02:27:23.804
<v Speaker 2>over the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody during that administration </v>

3376
02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:32.510
<v Speaker 2>appeared to have used a tear tear gas on</v>
<v Speaker 2>an illegal immigrant as well,</v>

3377
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was this kind of thing.</v>

3378
02:27:35.931 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 2>This kind of thing seems</v>

3379
02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>like the cuban boatlift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's what I felt like about it as</v>

3380
02:27:40.731 --> 02:27:42.380
<v Speaker 1>like they're fleeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3381
02:27:42.381 --> 02:27:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like a dead spot or you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3382
02:27:45.470 --> 02:27:47.000
<v Speaker 1>It's political and economic.</v>

3383
02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:48.173
<v Speaker 2>It's everything mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to come to the promise land </v>

3384
02:27:49.861 --> 02:27:52.350
<v Speaker 2>like all of our ancestors did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're here.</v>

3385
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.620
<v Speaker 2>But then we got to a point where</v>

3386
02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's just about just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to come here,</v>

3387
02:27:57.651 --> 02:28:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it's about what's at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they got to get away from this.</v>

3388
02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now with the internet and </v>

3389
02:28:02.031 --> 02:28:03.650
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

3390
02:28:03.651 --> 02:28:06.920
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we don't have to be in this gang.</v>

3391
02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:08.713
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can get my kid out when he's </v>

3392
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:12.320
<v Speaker 2>three instead of watching them die at </v>
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>

3393
02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And have opportunity.</v>

3394
02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody wanted.</v>

3395
02:28:16.281 --> 02:28:18.680
<v Speaker 2>The came here in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just at this point,</v>

3396
02:28:18.681 --> 02:28:20.780
<v Speaker 2>if you're a poor person from Guatemala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3397
02:28:20.781 --> 02:28:23.570
<v Speaker 2>how is it to immigrate to America if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any skills,</v>

3398
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:24.673
<v Speaker 2>you have a very short education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be really fucking hard to </v>

3399
02:28:28.461 --> 02:28:32.060
<v Speaker 2>become a us citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably super difficult.</v>

3400
02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:33.523
<v Speaker 6>You got to be super brave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go to learn another language to </v>

3401
02:28:36.271 --> 02:28:40.080
<v Speaker 6>really figure out how to get through all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other countries and the new America.</v>

3402
02:28:40.081 --> 02:28:42.510
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to learn it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it certainly helps.</v>

3403
02:28:42.511 --> 02:28:45.060
<v Speaker 6>If you want to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go to Costa Rica.</v>

3404
02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:46.560
<v Speaker 6>Have you been down there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Love it.</v>

02:29:24.071 --> 02:29:25.930
<v Speaker 2>They open them up and chew the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>part first.</v>

3424
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:27.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat so many that they know how to </v>

3425
02:29:28.661 --> 02:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>pop them up and they chew that white </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit show.</v>

3426
02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were concerned.</v>

3427
02:29:32.321 --> 02:29:33.154
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we really give the monkey a </v>

3428
02:29:33.881 --> 02:29:36.460
<v Speaker 2>cookie and cookies are toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all sugar.</v>

3429
02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.290
<v Speaker 2>We gave them monkeY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The monkey took that thing.</v>

3430
02:29:38.291 --> 02:29:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Pop the tYpe stuff probably lives on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>steady diet of oreos.</v>

3431
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:46.703
<v Speaker 2>Oreos are the minibar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hotel and the monkeys right there </v>

3432
02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.370
<v Speaker 2>give have a oreo man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see them.</v>

3433
02:29:51.371 --> 02:29:54.550
<v Speaker 2>They have no fear of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just have a little bit of fear.</v>

3434
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:57.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a there.</v>

3435
02:29:57.271 --> 02:29:58.104
<v Speaker 2>They'd be definitely size you up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they run into dickhead humans </v>

3436
02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>and they're fucking dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they decide to fuck you up,</v>

3437
02:30:05.290 --> 02:30:07.800
<v Speaker 2>they can hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can call your face apart,</v>

3438
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:10.130
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can really do damage if there,</v>

3439
02:30:10.390 --> 02:30:12.100
<v Speaker 2>especially this side of the act as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

3440
02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:16.600
<v Speaker 2>but they just seem to be a monkey </v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging at me once on a tv set and I'll</v>

3441
02:30:16.601 --> 02:30:18.700
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never go to another one.</v>

3442
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:19.603
<v Speaker 2>Suite your face.</v>

3443
02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:21.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno.</v>

3444
02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:22.593
<v Speaker 6>I was holding his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were entering it like we were </v>

3445
02:30:27.341 --> 02:30:28.174
<v Speaker 6>entering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was hosting a gong show pilot a </v>

3446
02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:34.540
<v Speaker 6>million years ago and I was entering </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a fucking gym pole in his hand.</v>

3447
02:30:34.541 --> 02:30:35.374
<v Speaker 6>We were in champ matching tuxedos and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>got along with them all day rehearsals </v>

3448
02:30:39.671 --> 02:30:40.504
<v Speaker 6>and then whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When that band kicked in and the lights </v>

3449
02:30:42.071 --> 02:30:43.920
<v Speaker 6>were in the role and the audience he </v>
<v Speaker 6>cherished,</v>

3450
02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:46.083
<v Speaker 6>he really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he was asking for more </v>

3451
02:30:47.021 --> 02:30:47.854
<v Speaker 6>money or.</v>

3452
02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3453
02:30:52.391 --> 02:30:53.770

<v Speaker 2>It probably hurt his ears.</v>

3454
02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:54.753
<v Speaker 2>Probably so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the people there doesn't speak your </v>

3505
02:32:49.781 --> 02:32:51.700

<v Speaker 5>The reason why they are not smart,</v>

3506
02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:54.790
<v Speaker 5>they live that long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They live all long time.</v>

3508
02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:01.033
<v Speaker 4>davis theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always in search of the next </v>

3509
02:33:02.970 --> 02:33:05.230
<v Speaker 4>algebra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my big thing.</v>

3510
02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that ravens are really smart.</v>

3511
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:10.010
<v Speaker 5>There's a super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they solve puzzles and shit,</v>

3512
02:33:10.011 --> 02:33:11.520
<v Speaker 5>like scientists set up all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>puzzles.</v>

3513
02:33:11.650 --> 02:33:13.040
<v Speaker 5>Ravens with they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3514
02:33:13.041 --> 02:33:16.850
<v Speaker 5>they'll take a stick and then use the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick to get a longer stick and then use</v>

3515
02:33:16.851 --> 02:33:19.070
<v Speaker 5>that stick to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the food out,</v>

3516
02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:21.710
<v Speaker 5>like multistep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like problem solving.</v>

3517
02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Ravens can do weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3518
02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:25.243
<v Speaker 5>and we know that a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of other different birds are </v>

3519
02:33:28.011 --> 02:33:29.630
<v Speaker 5>pretty fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know,</v>

3520
02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:32.660
<v Speaker 5>my hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my hawks hawks in my neighborhood,</v>

3521
02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:33.853
<v Speaker 5>they're smart who fly right over my </v>
<v Speaker 5>house all the time and they're </v>

3522
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:39.590
<v Speaker 5>fascinating to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really like to show off.</v>

3523
02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:40.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would assume that all those predators </v>

3524
02:33:42.021 --> 02:33:43.280
<v Speaker 5>have to be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they just,</v>

3525
02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:45.320
<v Speaker 5>they have to be ruthless and smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3526
02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:48.260
<v Speaker 5>to get along if you're out there picking</v>
<v Speaker 5>up squirrels and rats and shit,</v>

3527
02:33:48.261 --> 02:33:49.094
<v Speaker 5>like they are doing digital firebomb and</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the sky snatching things up from </v>

3528
02:33:52.521 --> 02:33:53.354
<v Speaker 5>angles that only they understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend tom was in his backyard </v>

3529
02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.373
<v Speaker 5>sitting down having a cup of coughing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he saw dove landed on top of his </v>

3530
02:34:01.101 --> 02:34:06.101
<v Speaker 5>fence and then out of nowhere this hawk </v>
<v Speaker 5>just chucked at da boom.</v>

3531
02:34:06.111 --> 02:34:06.944
<v Speaker 5>He said it was like a big explosion of </v>
<v Speaker 5>feathers that the hawk just swooped in </v>

3532
02:34:10.191 --> 02:34:14.450
<v Speaker 5>going like 150 miles an hour glass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>snatch the dove right off it and it took</v>

3533
02:34:14.451 --> 02:34:17.200
<v Speaker 5>off and he was just sitting there with </v>
<v Speaker 5>his coffee and his like,</v>

3534
02:34:17.201 --> 02:34:18.220
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

3535
02:34:18.270 --> 02:34:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes Like 10 yards from my head.</v>

3536
02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It just thought it was dove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have kicked.</v>

3537
02:34:24.930 --> 02:34:25.763

<v Speaker 2>plane?</v>

3540
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:44.720

<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3543
02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give him that.</v>

3544
02:34:49.690 --> 02:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>He probably does have to fight a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit too.</v>

3545
02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:52.800
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

3546
02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the movie play.</v>

3547
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Micky ward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like he knows how to box.</v>

3548
02:34:56.651 --> 02:34:57.910
<v Speaker 2>He definitely knows how to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches,</v>

3549
02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:00.850
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is michael b.</v>

3550
02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:01.683
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks fascinating to me because he'll </v>

3551
02:35:02.431 --> 02:35:03.430
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made money on it.</v>

3552
02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I hope it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone will tell them I'm looking.</v>

3553
02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:06.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's a smart guy and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a great athlete and I'm sure he </v>

3554
02:35:09.701 --> 02:35:13.510
<v Speaker 2>probably knows how to box a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you kind of box guy like roy,</v>

3555
02:35:13.511 --> 02:35:14.344
<v Speaker 2>jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you do,</v>

3556
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:15.423
<v Speaker 2>you started the amateurs and you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to box and then you become a </v>

3557
02:35:17.651 --> 02:35:22.410
<v Speaker 2>professional and then one day you box </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones newman and the race cars.</v>

3558
02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.020
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going,</v>

3559
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.590
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3560
02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:30.580
<v Speaker 2>the very unique thing about combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports is you're getting hit,</v>

3561
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:32.650
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like someone's dunking on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3562
02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if you played basketball with coby </v>
<v Speaker 2>bryant,</v>

3563
02:35:34.331 --> 02:35:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to look like a fool,</v>

3564
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to get hit a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes.</v>

3565
02:35:38.741 --> 02:35:39.574
<v Speaker 2>Roy jones jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna get you're gonna get </v>

3566
02:35:42.010 --> 02:35:42.843
<v Speaker 2>dinged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan got knocked out during </v>

3567
02:35:45.371 --> 02:35:49.360
<v Speaker 2>decreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filming acts by with an accidental punch</v>

3568
02:35:49.361 --> 02:35:50.640
<v Speaker 2>that landed where they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3569
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:51.543
<v Speaker 2>where they were hitting him and he tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like turn his head at the last </v>

3570
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:54.910
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't turn it quick enough and</v>

3571
02:35:54.911 --> 02:35:55.744
<v Speaker 2>he got clipped and dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why he knows he can take a </v>

3572
02:35:58.661 --> 02:35:59.810
<v Speaker 2>punch now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3573
02:35:59.811 --> 02:36:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's given him the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence.</v>

3574
02:36:01.450 --> 02:36:02.650
<v Speaker 2>He did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

3575
02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3576
02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:04.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it was like you take the punch </v>

3577
02:36:06.821 --> 02:36:07.654
<v Speaker 2>then turn your habit.</v>

3578
02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:09.520
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he took the punch just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little too hard.</v>

3579
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:10.443
<v Speaker 2>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3580
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:13.630
<v Speaker 2>That looks good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't really real gloves there.</v>

3581
02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Then I use them regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're using boxing gloves.</v>

3582
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:18.423
<v Speaker 2>Could it be bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love those korean movies and they see </v>

3583
02:36:21.411 --> 02:36:22.244
<v Speaker 2>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if it's like some thing </v>

3584
02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:26.290
<v Speaker 2>they do for a publicity stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3585
02:36:26.291 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see that they're practicing like this.</v>

3586
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:31.630
<v Speaker 2>See right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now see that's real dude.</v>

3587
02:36:31.631 --> 02:36:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

3588
02:36:33.370 --> 02:36:36.040
<v Speaker 2>See the way his head snaps in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go play that again.</v>

3589
02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:39.130
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what a real knockout looks like.</v>

3590
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a thousand of them in person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real knockout.</v>

3591
02:36:42.161 --> 02:36:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This look at this,</v>

3592
02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:48.580
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up and he's out cold dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out cold.</v>

3593
02:36:48.581 --> 02:36:49.750
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

3594
02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:56.670
<v Speaker 2>He ran right into the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His head snapped Back,</v>

3595
02:36:56.671 --> 02:36:59.380
<v Speaker 2>his eyes rolled behind his head and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants conscious yet,</v>

3596
02:36:59.550 --> 02:37:04.550
<v Speaker 2>but that is 100 percent legit knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that punch was not even a punch.</v>

3597
02:37:04.730 --> 02:37:05.200
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3598
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.500
<v Speaker 2>what he was hit with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He even had a mystery behind it.</v>

3599
02:37:07.650 --> 02:37:08.483
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have any power behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was basically knocked out Just by </v>

3600
02:37:12.001 --> 02:37:13.090
<v Speaker 2>coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3601
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.690
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely power behind it.</v>

3602
02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>If they say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3603
02:37:15.921 --> 02:37:16.200
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3604
02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

3605
02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.950
<v Speaker 5>you could kao someone easily just doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that easily.</v>

3606
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.923
<v Speaker 5>That was perfect punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a perfect punch that landed on </v>

3607
02:37:23.031 --> 02:37:25.550
<v Speaker 5>his jaw as he was moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the key.</v>

3608
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:26.533
<v Speaker 5>The key is that he was turning his head </v>
<v Speaker 5>into it and he didn't think it was </v>

3609
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:33.770
<v Speaker 5>coming in and he took it right on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>jaw if you want play it because I didn't</v>

3610
02:37:33.771 --> 02:37:36.390
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he's doing is he's there.</v>

3611
02:37:36.391 --> 02:37:37.224
<v Speaker 5>They're choreographing how the sequence </v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to go and somewhere along the </v>

3612
02:37:40.251 --> 02:37:41.084
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either as a miscalculation or a mistake </v>

3613
02:37:42.921 --> 02:37:44.820
<v Speaker 5>was made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this will be Jordan,</v>

3614
02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:45.890
<v Speaker 5>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's this?</v>

3615
02:37:45.891 --> 02:37:49.400
<v Speaker 5>Right here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>See that he fucked up and they turned in</v>

3616
02:37:49.430 --> 02:37:53.350
<v Speaker 5>to do it and that guy is throwing like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3617
02:37:53.390 --> 02:37:55.610
<v Speaker 5>even though it's not the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>punch in the world,</v>

3618
02:37:55.611 --> 02:37:58.820
<v Speaker 5>it's faster than I thought and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to punch.</v>

3619
02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:00.860
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So his weight is behind that.</v>

3620
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:04.190
<v Speaker 5>His shoulders behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a guy who's punched people in the</v>

3621
02:38:04.191 --> 02:38:06.290
<v Speaker 5>face before he knows exactly how to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3622
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:08.720
<v Speaker 5>So even though he's only doing it like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3623
02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:09.853
<v Speaker 5>even though he's only doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'll run into it and he catches it </v>

3624
02:38:12.370 --> 02:38:13.970
<v Speaker 5>on the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going out of course.</v>

3625
02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:15.230
<v Speaker 5>and that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why,</v>

3626
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:16.123
<v Speaker 5>why did that get a leak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't know if it got leaked or if </v>

3627
02:38:17.991 --> 02:38:18.824
<v Speaker 5>they put it out on perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put it out to show that they </v>

3628
02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:20.913
<v Speaker 5>probably probably put it out to show you</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is hard training they're doing for </v>

3629
02:38:23.241 --> 02:38:23.990
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3630
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:25.970
<v Speaker 5>there was an accident on the set and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>got knocked out.</v>

3631
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:28.910
<v Speaker 5>I will be not the clip I'd want out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there if I was him,</v>

3632
02:38:29.130 --> 02:38:32.580
<v Speaker 5>but it turns into a site that was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was younger than.</v>

3633
02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 5>He's bigger and stronger now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's older.</v>

3634
02:38:34.761 --> 02:38:36.740
<v Speaker 5>His body's more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but either way.</v>

3635
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:38.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want a box.</v>

3636
02:38:38.991 --> 02:38:42.440
<v Speaker 5>Roy jones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first one you got to become a career</v>

3637
02:38:42.441 --> 02:38:43.630
<v Speaker 5>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3638
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:46.830
<v Speaker 5>unless he's like so old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't take a punch.</v>

3639
02:38:47.010 --> 02:38:47.843
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or he would never have given up his </v>

3640
02:38:49.461 --> 02:38:51.830
<v Speaker 5>strategy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need them five,</v>

3641
02:38:51.831 --> 02:38:55.640
<v Speaker 5>six rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just shit talking.</v>

3642
02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:56.853
<v Speaker 5>Anything did that his whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly how he was going to beat guys </v>

3643
02:39:01.930 --> 02:39:03.530
<v Speaker 5>this whole career choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

3644
02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:06.020
<v Speaker 5>He's still Roy Jones jr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

3645
02:39:06.021 --> 02:39:08.870
<v Speaker 5>Talk like him saying just played dumb </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be like,</v>

3646
02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.180
<v Speaker 5>he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>

3647
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:12.830
<v Speaker 5>That's not what he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would say,</v>

3648
02:39:12.831 --> 02:39:15.080
<v Speaker 5>this is how I'm going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he would go out and do it.</v>

3649
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to need you to get tired out.</v>

3650
02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:18.440
<v Speaker 5>See what it feels like to be in a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

3651
02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:19.550
<v Speaker 5>It take a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3652
02:39:19.570 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3653
02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:22.550
<v Speaker 5>if I can tell was junior just gets you </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the third,</v>

3654
02:39:22.551 --> 02:39:25.010
<v Speaker 5>fourth and fifth round and you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your adrenaline dump.</v>

3655
02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:25.873
<v Speaker 5>Dump is gone because you're not used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing a worldclass boxer in a </v>

3656
02:39:29.451 --> 02:39:32.930
<v Speaker 5>professional matches on paper view that </v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of people are watching not used</v>

3657
02:39:32.931 --> 02:39:35.120
<v Speaker 5>to that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that experIence is taxing.</v>

3658
02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:37.550
<v Speaker 5>It's nerve racking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have all this adrenaline</v>

3659
02:39:37.551 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 5>rush through your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you're the the chillest of chill</v>

3660
02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:42.320
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be just a little bit too</v>

3661
02:39:42.321 --> 02:39:43.040
<v Speaker 5>amped up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3662
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.110
<v Speaker 5>So then around that second round comes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he started,</v>

3663
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:48.280
<v Speaker 5>he even and you can't breathe that good </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you just kinda like,</v>

3664
02:39:48.430 --> 02:39:50.780
<v Speaker 5>we're always just kind of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just boxing you.</v>

3665
02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.430
<v Speaker 5>he's not hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just boxing you.</v>

3666
02:39:52.431 --> 02:39:53.264
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally you get stung a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the third round moves in and he </v>

3667
02:39:55.971 --> 02:39:59.390
<v Speaker 5>starts moving left and right and come in</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stinging.</v>

3668
02:39:59.391 --> 02:40:02.540
<v Speaker 5>You hard the jab,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stepping in with a lead hand,</v>

3669
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:04.650
<v Speaker 5>upper cut and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck yeah.</v>

3670
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Now you're getting teed off on and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's talking,</v>

3671
02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:08.173
<v Speaker 5>he's dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's moving around and then he's just </v>

3672
02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:10.153
<v Speaker 5>charged stolen bombs on you and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't defend them because you're </v>

3673
02:40:12.321 --> 02:40:13.154
<v Speaker 5>exhausted and he hooks you to the liver </v>
<v Speaker 5>and drops you hunted around trying to </v>

3674
02:40:16.201 --> 02:40:19.320
<v Speaker 5>get away from get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's too good.</v>

3675
02:40:19.321 --> 02:40:20.880
<v Speaker 5>he's been doing it for too long.</v>

3676
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Joan said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

3677
02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:23.673
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably can go long and hard on me </v>

3678
02:40:24.551 --> 02:40:25.384
<v Speaker 4>because he's all trained up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you think he would come and I'm </v>

3679
02:40:26.981 --> 02:40:27.814
<v Speaker 4>like full tilt in the first round or two</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just like really like take them to </v>

3680
02:40:30.851 --> 02:40:31.401
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3681
02:40:31.401 --> 02:40:32.740
<v Speaker 4>like the speed downs.</v>

3682
02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:36.010
<v Speaker 5>Dangerous because when you get real </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive is when you get hit.</v>

3683
02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Because when you get real aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say if I know you're coming at me,</v>

3684
02:40:38.801 --> 02:40:39.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're running at me,</v>

3685
02:40:39.701 --> 02:40:40.534
<v Speaker 5>you're running at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All I have to do is figure out how much </v>

3686
02:40:42.941 --> 02:40:43.774
<v Speaker 5>time and space I need to get something </v>
<v Speaker 5>off as You're coming at me because I </v>

3687
02:40:46.991 --> 02:40:47.824
<v Speaker 5>know where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dangerous when you don't know if </v>

3688
02:40:49.631 --> 02:40:51.400
<v Speaker 5>someone's coming and going when </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's not.</v>

3689
02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:52.570
<v Speaker 5>When you don't know if they're coming to</v>
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

3690
02:40:52.571 --> 02:40:55.030
<v Speaker 5>that's when a fight is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the beginning of every fight,</v>

3691
02:40:55.270 --> 02:40:56.103
<v Speaker 5>people are feeling each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know if someone's coming to </v>

3692
02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:59.830
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I know that you're just running at me</v>

3693
02:41:00.010 --> 02:41:00.843
<v Speaker 5>and I'm Roy Jones jr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to step back and I'm going to </v>

3694
02:41:02.471 --> 02:41:03.304
<v Speaker 5>time it and I crack you and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>crack you in a way that you probably </v>

3695
02:41:05.861 --> 02:41:06.640
<v Speaker 5>don't see coming.</v>

3696
02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:08.320
<v Speaker 5>You probably don't see it in the gym too</v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

3697
02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:10.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to stiff arm you with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>jab,</v>

3698
02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.610
<v Speaker 5>pop you in place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>step to the left.</v>

3699
02:41:12.611 --> 02:41:13.444
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to drop out right hand on </v>

3700
02:41:14.321 --> 02:41:15.520
<v Speaker 5>your chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's goIng to fuck you up,</v>

3701
02:41:15.580 --> 02:41:16.413
<v Speaker 5>and then he's going to turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be behind you and he's </v>

3702
02:41:18.131 --> 02:41:18.964
<v Speaker 5>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at you to see if you're still okay </v>

3703
02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.940
<v Speaker 5>and then he's going to do it again and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to keep doing it.</v>

3704
02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:24.330
<v Speaker 5>If you keep chasing after him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to still get fucked.</v>

3705
02:41:24.370 --> 02:41:27.730
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get fucked up and going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get your face punched in.</v>

3706
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:30.790
<v Speaker 5>So the only other thing is to do is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got a buxom,</v>

3707
02:41:31.270 --> 02:41:32.103
<v Speaker 5>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're boxing one of the greatest </v>

3708
02:41:33.221 --> 02:41:34.054
<v Speaker 5>boxers of all time and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's just going to just figure you </v>

3709
02:41:36.251 --> 02:41:36.460
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3710
02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:38.080
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you do when I do this?</v>

3711
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:41.140
<v Speaker 5>What happens when I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens here?</v>

3712
02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Could I have punched you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3713
02:41:42.821 --> 02:41:43.654
<v Speaker 5>I could have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he's going to figure out when </v>

3714
02:41:45.161 --> 02:41:45.994
<v Speaker 5>to move and when you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>tired and he's going to start dropping </v>

3715
02:41:47.771 --> 02:41:49.210
<v Speaker 5>bombs on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be awful.</v>

3716
02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:50.950
<v Speaker 5>Which you have respected it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he said,</v>

3717

<v Speaker 5>He was just having a good time.</v>

3720
02:41:58.130 --> 02:41:59.710
<v Speaker 5>Probably didn't expect anybody to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

3721
02:41:59.711 --> 02:42:01.950
<v Speaker 5>He didn't expect people to analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the guy who you know.</v>

3722
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.640
<v Speaker 5>And that video.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy is a legit boxer.</v>

3728

<v Speaker 5>russian motherfucker on a well look what</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's so good man.</v>

3733
02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:29.950
<v Speaker 5>So for him to do it accidentally makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>complete total sense.</v>

<v Speaker 5>training and,</v>

3739
02:42:48.001 --> 02:42:48.834
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

3740
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:52.140
<v Speaker 4>filming after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the heavyweight class,</v>

3741
02:42:52.141 --> 02:42:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you never saw abs until the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never.</v>

3742
02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.230
<v Speaker 4>It was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3743
02:42:56.231 --> 02:42:56.790
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3744
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:57.623
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like basically punching bags </v>

3745
02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:01.590
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like they have to be.</v>

3746
02:43:01.591 --> 02:43:01.980
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3747
02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 5>tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saw abs when he came out of prison.</v>

3748
02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess when you fought peter mcneely,</v>

3749
02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:08.880
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was prison jacked.</v>

3750
02:43:09.330 --> 02:43:11.630
<v Speaker 5>That was like maybe the scariest tyson </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

3751
02:43:11.631 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Like they finally</v>

3752
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:14.660
<v Speaker 2>released him and all he'd been doing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

3753
02:43:15.270 --> 02:43:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he could box in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think he was just lifting weights.</v>

3754
02:43:19.410 --> 02:43:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You remember he was super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super jacked when he got out of jail.</v>

3755
02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3756
02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:26.150
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to tyson.</v>

3757
02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Pei.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's tyson versus peter mcneely.</v>

3758
02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:31.150
<v Speaker 2>That was in 1995.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks good.</v>

3759
02:43:31.170 --> 02:43:35.380
<v Speaker 2>They're terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the most terrifying movie tyson</v>

3760
02:43:35.381 --> 02:43:36.214
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just looked like he was made out of </v>

3761
02:43:37.211 --> 02:43:40.850
<v Speaker 2>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a tank of a man,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He doesn't smoke as I haven't.</v>

3910
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:25.230
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen him in quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But last time you did the podcast,</v>

3911
02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:26.093

<v Speaker 6>Did he smoke the last time or a time </v>

3912
02:50:27.121 --> 02:50:28.830
<v Speaker 6>before that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He takes time off.</v>

3913
02:50:28.831 --> 02:50:31.440
<v Speaker 6>I think for awhile he would just bring </v>
<v Speaker 6>them on the smoking.</v>

3914
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:33.610
<v Speaker 6>He's smoking smoking a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw him.</v>

3918
02:50:38.850 --> 02:50:42.840
<v Speaker 6>he made me pretend he was half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 6>late even though I was 10 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>come in pretending he's late.</v>

3921
02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:56.130

<v Speaker 6>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ray romano came up as the headliner who </v>

3951

<v Speaker 6>No matter what.</v>

3955
02:52:32.711 --> 02:52:35.740
<v Speaker 6>Just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ray was in his prime back then too</v>

3956
02:52:36.350 --> 02:52:40.400

3958
02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:47.390
<v Speaker 2>hbo had done something on hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was just a machine man.</v>

3959
02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:51.060
<v Speaker 2>People like people didn't realize how </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean he is a great time.</v>

3960
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:51.903

<v Speaker 2>when they talk about great standup </v>

3961
02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:55.753
<v Speaker 2>comics because he hasn't put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff out there in a long time ever </v>

3962
02:52:59.151 --> 02:53:00.290

02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:11.793
<v Speaker 2>comics and how devastating would it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>if the other comics didn't want you </v>

3991
02:54:14.891 --> 02:54:19.390
<v Speaker 2>around that man without a country </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3992
02:54:19.410 --> 02:54:22.450
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets fucking dark man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3993
02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it.</v>

3994
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:28.390
<v Speaker 2>So anybody who falls into that group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you fucked up,</v>

3995
02:54:28.450 --> 02:54:30.900
<v Speaker 2>like the whole thing is to be friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the comedian.</v>

3996
02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Hang is what it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3997
02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the hang.</v>

3998
02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:34.850
<v Speaker 6>So how did you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me ask you,</v>

3999
02:54:34.851 --> 02:54:37.990
<v Speaker 6>how did you feel when you were in self,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4000
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:39.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4001
02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:42.650
<v Speaker 6>you pulled yourself out of the world at </v>
<v Speaker 6>a comedy store where you started,</v>

4002
02:54:42.651 --> 02:54:43.484
<v Speaker 6>did you feel like on a desert island by </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself or did you find community at </v>

4003
02:54:47.481 --> 02:54:48.560
<v Speaker 6>the other clubs or.</v>

4004
02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I never found the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4005
02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but I just kept working and I always was</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with ari and joey and dunkin.</v>

4006
02:54:54.251 --> 02:54:56.200
<v Speaker 2>I still kept working with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

4007
02:54:56.530 --> 02:54:57.363
<v Speaker 2>I was working with most of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics and I was just doing practice </v>

4008
02:54:59.831 --> 02:55:03.530
<v Speaker 2>sets at the ice house and at the improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember all that.</v>

4009
02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was more,</v>

4010
02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:07.210
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4011
02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:08.113
<v Speaker 2>the hang was on the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do my psets the improv and just </v>

4012
02:55:10.641 --> 02:55:12.890
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no place to hang out.</v>

4013
02:55:12.970 --> 02:55:15.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the same how you get to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun for sure.</v>

4014
02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.930
<v Speaker 2>You got to do stand up on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roast battle,</v>

4015
02:55:17.931 --> 02:55:18.764
<v Speaker 2>made room a oh are and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd figured out in the parking lot </v>

4016
02:55:22.101 --> 02:55:24.380
<v Speaker 2>without him and then a podcast in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

4017
02:55:24.381 --> 02:55:26.870
<v Speaker 2>You could literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can put a gym in there.</v>

4018
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:30.770
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably never leave everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place.</v>

4019
02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:32.340
<v Speaker 2>You could do three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done three shows.</v>

4020
02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:33.193
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done four shows in a night because </v>

4021
02:55:34.251 --> 02:55:36.260
<v Speaker 2>one night I did two sets in the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

4022
02:55:36.261 --> 02:55:39.270
<v Speaker 2>one set and the belly room and one set </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the or because it was to show.</v>

4023
02:55:39.271 --> 02:55:41.910
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy to follow this </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

4024
02:55:41.911 --> 02:55:45.050
<v Speaker 2>So many times everything I ever taped </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you on the show,</v>

4025
02:55:45.170 --> 02:55:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I developed funnel having to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow him.</v>

4026
02:55:47.710 --> 02:55:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like steam rolling like civilization.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all in 20 minutes.</v>

4029
02:55:58.371 --> 02:56:00.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowds,</v>

4030
02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:01.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>great acts like just come by and just </v>

4032

<v Speaker 2>for like 10 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 bucks,</v>

4033
02:56:07.851 --> 02:56:09.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get to see chris rock,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

4035
02:56:11.301 --> 02:56:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like people dropping by and working</v>

4036
02:56:13.071 --> 02:56:14.160
<v Speaker 2>on stuff they like.</v>

4037
02:56:14.190 --> 02:56:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Is it like this all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't even get it.</v>

4038
02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:19.040
<v Speaker 2>You just saw a $500 show for like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinks.</v>

4039
02:56:19.041 --> 02:56:19.874
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say that to the people at the </v>

4040
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:24.270
<v Speaker 2>cellar to if you're a fan of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time.</v>

4041
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:26.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what missing new year's right </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

4042
02:56:26.091 --> 02:56:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And I attribute all this to the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hate the web.</v>

4043
02:56:29.450 --> 02:56:30.283
<v Speaker 2>The internet did all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why everybody's aware </v>

4044
02:56:32.451 --> 02:56:34.610
<v Speaker 2>of how fun it is to go to a live comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

4045
02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:35.773
<v Speaker 2>How fun it is to watch guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll go to see you at the store </v>

4046
02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:41.000
<v Speaker 2>and then they go to see you again six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months later and go,</v>

4047
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.863
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking comedy central and hbo and </v>

4048
02:56:44.721 --> 02:56:45.554
<v Speaker 2>showtime and netflix and all the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comedy central definitely made it </v>

4049
02:56:50.271 --> 02:56:52.010
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy central for sure.</v>

4050
02:56:52.011 --> 02:56:53.690
<v Speaker 2>All those things definitely attribute to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4051
02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:56.660
<v Speaker 2>But what about evening at the improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>tube is one of the biggest factors.</v>

4052
02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:58.850
<v Speaker 2>The fact that people can watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up on youtube,</v>

4053
02:56:58.851 --> 02:56:59.684
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people that are watching </v>

4054
02:57:00.981 --> 02:57:04.310
<v Speaker 2>youtube is off the charts and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can Just type in right now,</v>

4055
02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:05.293
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy poom and instantaneously </v>

4056
02:57:07.161 --> 02:57:10.070
<v Speaker 2>get it and a lot of those clips come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from comedy central,</v>

4057
02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:12.710
<v Speaker 2>hbo and all those other places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>

4058
02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:14.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all contributes.</v>

4059
02:57:14.481 --> 02:57:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Not one thing that did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the one big important factor</v>

4060
02:57:19.041 --> 02:57:22.100
<v Speaker 2>was this new channel of distribution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the internet,</v>

4061
02:57:22.130 --> 02:57:22.963
<v Speaker 2>whether it's netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably one of the biggest </v>

4062
02:57:24.591 --> 02:57:27.110
<v Speaker 2>thing right now for stand up comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>specials ever.</v>

4063
02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:28.293
<v Speaker 2>RiGht.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's never been a thing like </v>

<v Speaker 2>netflix,</v>
