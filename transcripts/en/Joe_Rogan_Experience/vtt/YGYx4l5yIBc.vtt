00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like,</v>

4
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>remember when you told me that story about the monkey that you had,</v>

5
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>that you had when you were on fear factor.</v>

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Beat my ass.</v>

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>That when you held that little thing you thought this thing's made a word that</v>

8
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what I feel when I get you up on my shoulder.</v>

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

10
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

11
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>this thing's made of wood.</v>

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

13
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Start beep do.</v>

14
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I was telling Jamie,</v>

15
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

16
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told you this story,</v>

17
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I've probably told to everybody I've met that I have a little baby champ on the</v>

18
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>set of Newsradio like way back in the day it was supposed to be in some stuff</v>

19
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.374
<v Speaker 1>that I tell you this,</v>

20
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.213
<v Speaker 1>I probably said it before.</v>

21
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>This little motherfucker was on my back and he hit me a couple of times and I</v>

22
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>was stunned.</v>

23
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

24
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

25
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>this is not what I thought.</v>

26
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>

27
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like a little person like,</v>

28
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:47.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

29
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>this little person thinks he's a bad ass.</v>

30
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Let me just calm him down.</v>

31
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Now he got on top of HR,</v>

32
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>just hit me a couple times.</v>

33
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>On the back and I was like,</v>

34
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

35
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I just was thinking it immediately.</v>

36
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I started doing the math in my head and thinking what it would be like to be</v>

37
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>confronted by a full grown chimp.</v>

38
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.801
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

39
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>well that's my argument with the silver back versus grizzly.</v>

40
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>You said Grizzly because grizzlies or even more and more of the fucking bad ass</v>

41
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.044
<v Speaker 1>than a chimp.</v>

42
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.233
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly.</v>

43
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly can't like,</v>

44
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>there's no way a chimp can outrun a grizzly.</v>

45
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

46
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Not a chance in hell.</v>

47
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.543
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

48
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>

49
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>What is a silver back?</v>

50
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.354
<v Speaker 1>Full speed.</v>

51
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I seen one of those things.</v>

52
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>No grizzly can outrun a soda.</v>

53
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

54
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm strong.</v>

55
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel confident.</v>

56
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I think chimps are faster than gorillas and I think at grizzly can outrun a</v>

57
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.384
<v Speaker 1>chimp.</v>

58
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And I sat for me,</v>

59
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no way the guerrillas getting fucked.</v>

60
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>He's getting D's,</v>

61
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

62
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now,</v>

63
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>big ass and tiering your hands feel like when they shake mine.</v>

64
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.253
<v Speaker 1>So I would be,</v>

65
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm not like a grizzly,</v>

66
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>but a giant dude</v>

67
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>would crumple you like half empty pop.</v>

68
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't even,</v>

69
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it would even be like,</v>

70
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even feel you.</v>

71
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He would go through you like whipped cream fee.</v>

72
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>25 miles an hour.</v>

73
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Top speed.</v>

74
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Why does it say feels like 25 feels late in 25 similar animals speeds 34 but it</v>

75
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>feels like 25 I don't understand.</v>

76
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>What that means is from someone riding it's back.</v>

77
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Get to a different website says,</v>

79
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.681

94
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

95
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>where does that name come from?</v>

96
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:40.084
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it.</v>

97
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool name.</v>

98
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Wapa Wednesday is the Hashtag.</v>

99
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Cam uses it a lot.</v>

100
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.661
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

101
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Wapa he Wednesday</v>

102
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>champ.</v>

103
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I said a silver back.</v>

104
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know is what you think a champ is faster.</v>

105
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Jump off there.</v>

106
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think in chip is faster than a gorilla?</v>

107
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] silver back.</v>

108
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen a silver back come out of the fricking</v>

110
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>told you so?</v>

111
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

112
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.603
<v Speaker 1>What I'm thinking</v>

113
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just like an archery argument.</v>

114
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:11.951
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

116
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the bear gets a heavy arrow,</v>

117
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>slower speed,</v>

118
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>fast Arrow,</v>

119
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's not much of a difference in the speed.</v>

120
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It's real close and a grizzly bear is so much bigger.</v>

121
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:27.121
<v Speaker 1>Moving so much more mass around like have a big grizzly is 500 pounds a silver</v>

122
00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

123
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

124
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean a big grizzly interior,</v>

125
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>grizzly,</v>

126
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.803
<v Speaker 1>what does a big one,</v>

127
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.040
<v Speaker 1>like 900 is that really not?</v>

128
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a mountain grizzly.</v>

129
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.343
<v Speaker 1>When you look it up,</v>

130
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>the more aggressive ones just say six or 700 and the really big ones,</v>

131
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.171
<v Speaker 1>the coastal ones,</v>

132
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

133
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>which they call brown bears,</v>

134
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.534
<v Speaker 1>first rounders.</v>

135
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Why do they call them that?</v>

136
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>But because it's the same animal,</v>

137
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>different specie,</v>

138
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.033
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

139
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

140
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>They're don't interbreed or anything bigger.</v>

142
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.930
<v Speaker 1>The break,</v>

143
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>there's just totally different bear.</v>

144
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>One looks like a Volkswagen with hair and one looks more like a Ford truck.</v>

146
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those other things where the the one that has the scary,</v>

147
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>your name is like not the biggest one,</v>

148
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>which is weird.</v>

149
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Like Brown bear sounded like,</v>

150
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>oh he's so cuddly.</v>

151
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

152
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>those buses reac island,</v>

153
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they sell coke Klondike bars.</v>

154
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

155
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>What would you do for a Klondike Bar?</v>

156
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I fucking power because your buddy,</v>

157
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:20.214
<v Speaker 1>I'm your buddy.</v>

158
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I live in a place where there's no vegetables.</v>

159
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a conspiracy theory.</v>

160
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Told her bears brought that up.</v>

161
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>They literally made those to make themselves look cuddly.</v>

162
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>So humans would be stupid enough to walk up to him.</v>

163
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's like a nature trick?</v>

164
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Like nature made them cool to look at.</v>

165
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So we don't mind as much that they're murderers.</v>

166
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I would argue Disney fucking Disney,</v>

167
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Like that Bambi movie so slower by 10 miles an hour.</v>

169
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.523
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

170
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>is there anyone that has the doctor told you no.</v>

171
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>But is there any strength of a silver back versus a grizzly?</v>

172
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And I say this saying,</v>

173
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I really respect grizzly bears and brown bears cause you know that well the</v>

174
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:05.400
<v Speaker 1>concerns of a lot of grizzly bears and brown bears that were listening to them</v>

175
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were there,</v>

176
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.273
<v Speaker 1>they're pumped.</v>

177
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that um,</v>

178
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>they're all dangerous and ferocious and I'm thinking silver back versus the</v>

179
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>nigger is you think you would win?</v>

180
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people will listen to this podcast and he's put it in the Po in the posts.</v>

182
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>What we need to know what people want to know.</v>

183
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat.</v>

184
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

185
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Be fucking terrified to fight at 38 pound rat.</v>

186
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of 38 I just cannot put a number cause that's a fucking giant rat</v>

187
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

188
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>but he should have said 30 40.</v>

190
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.911
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

191
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but like 48</v>

192
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>what's a house cat weigh like 10 pounds.</v>

193
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.693
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

194
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the Garfield waste.</v>

195
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

200
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I would think something along those lines.</v>

201
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

202

219
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>if you grabbed a 10 pound mountain lion,</v>

220
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.450
<v Speaker 1>do you think you can control that thing?</v>

221
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

222
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.143
<v Speaker 1>My neighbor,</v>

233
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

234
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>then mark got a website,</v>

235
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>got on a website and found out that,</v>

236
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>that they attract this animal and that it a,</v>

238
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>it had a collar on it and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the tracked it and it got hit by a car.</v>

240
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>On the five and he's explaining like how the whole,</v>

241
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing went down and I was like,</v>

242
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:04.701
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

243
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>like that thing you were walking your dogs and this big ass cat,</v>

244
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:10.640

245
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>So the actual cat that had a collar,</v>

246
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>he knew that's the one he encountered.</v>

247
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>He saw,</v>

250
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>he saw the collar and then he went on the website and you can track because he,</v>

251
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>he'd found out that this cat had died and when he found out the cat died,</v>

252

<v Speaker 1>Are you one of those guys bro?</v>

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.333
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

265
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That's my instinct.</v>

266
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>What we were just,</v>

267
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

268
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I just getting it to it?</v>

269
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.973
<v Speaker 1>I had on the rat.</v>

270
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

271
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Among other things.</v>

272
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>So a silver back is essentially like a super,</v>

273
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>a super prime it right.</v>

274
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.111
<v Speaker 1>The most super,</v>

275
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:51.711
<v Speaker 1>super prime.</v>

276
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

277
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>But a bear is one of the most super,</v>

278
00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Super Freak Predator animal freak out.</v>

279
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Things like if a bear was little,</v>

280
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>like a nine pound bear,</v>

281
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>like the size of a nine pound rat was trying to kill you,</v>

282
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd would be freaking the fuck out if it was running annual,</v>

283
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>like a little tiny bear,</v>

284
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fucking terrified.</v>

285
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Now think of a giant one and realize how PR you.</v>

286
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You are totally defenseless and I don't think it's going to be that much</v>

287
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:24.251
<v Speaker 1>difference for literally think of a silver back gorilla with the way they're</v>

288
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 1>built and they swing around.</v>

289
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I think if he stood on the chest of a grizzly can grab its paws and literally</v>

290
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 1>rip its arms out and beat it with it.</v>

291
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

292
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>That's King Kong was a good movie.</v>

293
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you there.</v>

294
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it as much as the next name,</v>

295
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I think in a Kong,</v>

296
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that.</v>

297
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's correct.</v>

298
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're that strong.</v>

299
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.051
<v Speaker 1>The thumb,</v>

300
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>the thumb doves does give an advantage of,</v>

301
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.031
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

302
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:47.864
<v Speaker 1>It could grab,</v>

303
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

304
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a little smarter.</v>

305
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.483
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

306
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Gray,</v>

307
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>

308
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>the bears way stronger,</v>

309
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.853
<v Speaker 1>way stronger,</v>

310
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>way stronger.</v>

311
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It could smack at once in a while.</v>

312
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>

313
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I've seen or I've seen a grown mountain grizzly hit a moose and Canada.</v>

314
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

315
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.171
<v Speaker 1>you told me that,</v>

316
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that I've seen you saw it with your own eyes.</v>

317
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.784
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

318
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Is there any solid information of strength of a silver back for,</v>

319
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.243
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

320
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lot of people that have argued this on the Internet for the last</v>

321
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 1>five to 10 we get dangerously close to this argument.</v>

322
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

323
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they put Thor's hammer on the ground have and like put a,</v>

324
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>put a Taco in it or something to where a grizzly has to try to grab it and pull</v>

325
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>it off and have a sensor versus the silver back down.</v>

326
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

327
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>the grizzly definitely can't grab as hard cause it doesn't have thumbs like we</v>

328
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:36.511
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

329
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.201
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

330
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:37.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

331
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>but that's relative to a beating,</v>

332
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:41.821
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

334
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:46.821
<v Speaker 1>how many fighters have a big ass and a lot of like leg power,</v>

335
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>cro cough versus someone that's just sheer grill up top.</v>

336
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's do go there.</v>

337
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder how strong a gorilla really is in comparison to which essentially</v>

338
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>like a giant dog.</v>

339
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I just think he's going to get far you crazy.</v>

340
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.790
<v Speaker 1>You think silver back is equivalent to a giant dog bear is what I'm saying is a</v>

341
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:08.161
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

342
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:10.070
<v Speaker 1>A bear is like essentially like a giant house,</v>

343
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but why would I call it silver back put dog.</v>
