1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>That what's her brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome back here.</v>

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're one of the few college professors</v>

3
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>that I was a sense of humor about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself like that.</v>

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you can joke around about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

7
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:22.161
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to you before the show </v>

8
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.531
<v Speaker 1>started about this recent article in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic and as soon as I saw it I was </v>

9
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:24.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

10
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>this is just right up your alley and is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the coddling of the American mind.</v>

11
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And this article is all about one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you have been talking about </v>

12
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot lately and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>it's been on a lot of people's minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that work in academia because it's,</v>

14
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:46.301
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very confusing and it's very </v>

15
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.441
<v Speaker 1>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is severe limitations on the </v>

16
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:54.381
<v Speaker 1>words that you can use and the thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>even that you can have in this article </v>

17
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>is all about trigger warnings.</v>

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in one case,</v>

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

20
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and there were professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this law.</v>

21
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Students were asking fellow professors </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Harvard not to teach rape law.</v>

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And in one case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even use the word violate,</v>

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>as in that violates the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less it caused distress.</v>

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>This is the article is called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coddling of the American mind.</v>

25
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>It's in the newest version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic Dot Com.</v>

26
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just a couple of days old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy what's going on with </v>

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>kids today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

29
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>this article gets into it and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them was about something that,</v>

30
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a professor for protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself with a pseudonym and he wrote an</v>

32
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.421
<v Speaker 1>essay for vox called I'm a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor in my liberal students,</v>

33
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>terrify me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is going on where people are </v>

35
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>getting in trouble for words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>violate.</v>

36
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

37
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:06.351
<v Speaker 1>one of the authors of that article is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good friend of mine who is director of </v>

38
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:10.701
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of the </v>

39
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:10.701
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the acronym stands for,</v>

40
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>but he basically goes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his organization,</v>

41
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.881
<v Speaker 1>goes around trying to protect freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech first amendment at campuses,</v>

42
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>precisely because of the unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 1>chilling effect of these types of lunacy</v>

43
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

44
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:30.231
<v Speaker 1>And you know what else is strange?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're not allowed to be </v>

45
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:34.491
<v Speaker 1>conservative in a university and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by conservative I don't mean </v>

46
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>restrictive of other people's liberties </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anti gay rights or anti choice or </v>

47
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>anti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about fiscally conservative.</v>

48
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about being a person who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that some in the Republican </v>

49
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spouse,</v>

50
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure if we discussed this </v>

51
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if we did,</v>

52
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>it's worth repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about an article,</v>

53
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>an article that was done by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues of mine.</v>

54
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

55
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>some academics</v>

56
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 2>where they looked at the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliation of professors at top.</v>

57
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it was California and schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>whether they identified it or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually had democratic affiliation</v>

59
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 2>or Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you might imagine,</v>

60
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>it was extraordinarily skewed towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>

61
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>But then depending on the field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

62
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in sociology and in the humanities and </v>

63
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>in women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women with a y,</v>

64
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.750
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't write women with an e.</v>

65
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>That would be sexist at even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I just said,</v>

66
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>the women oftentimes and women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>

67
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.511
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that to have men as part of </v>

68
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>the word women is itself a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>

69
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So they've altered the spelling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight men.</v>

70
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not real.</v>

71
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know your audience already has the </v>

72
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 2>price of admission covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that story,</v>

73
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's still the word women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

74
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the same word.</v>

75
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to change the letters?</v>

76
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>So in sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you train,</v>

77
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>change the word trigger because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like the n word or a serious.</v>

78
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>You're getting triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm triggered,</v>

79
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 2>triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

80
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was black,</v>

81
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I'd be super triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

82
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you noticed some of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets.</v>

83
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Now whenever I tweet anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a trigger warning trigger warning.</v>

84
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not become part of the vernacular </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it sit there article.</v>

85
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It's too close to the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Too close.</v>

86
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

87
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960
<v Speaker 2>to finish the point about the study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44 to one ratio in sociology.</v>

88
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>So imagine if you are a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take doing an Undergrad in sociology,</v>

89
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a very good thing to have.</v>

90
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:43.501
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of the professors that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will ever come across be of one </v>

91
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:43.501
<v Speaker 2>particular persuasion.</v>

92
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Now some people will write to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

93
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but what do you mean the Democrats have </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

94
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have truth on their side and the </v>

95
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:54.151
<v Speaker 2>Republicans are a bunch of hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when it comes to evolution </v>

96
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:54.151
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>

97
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

98
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if on average republicans are more </v>

99
00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 2>likely to deny evolution than that point</v>
<v Speaker 2>is well taken,</v>

100
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the death penalty,</v>

101
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 2>right or wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's kind of fiscal policy should you </v>

102
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.901
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What type of foreign policy should you </v>

103
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:09.901
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a one plus one,</v>

104
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific equation,</v>

105
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>so you should be exposed to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints,</v>

106
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>but of course you shouldn't be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should only interact with people who</v>

107
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:22.321
<v Speaker 2>are similar to you will that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a problem with a lot of people </v>

108
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate,</v>

109
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 2>get their phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their doctorate,</v>

110
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>and then start teaching and never enter </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real world,</v>

111
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stay in this sort of insulated </v>

112
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 2>world of academia and then they espouse </v>
<v Speaker 2>these same ideas.</v>

113
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 2>They promote these same idea that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote the same way of thinking as if </v>

114
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>this is the real world because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only world they know true.</v>

115
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about comedians is a </v>

116
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>lot of them are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really crazy and fucked up and they do a</v>

117
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:55.891
<v Speaker 2>lot of drugs and they're just out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and not and they kind of forget </v>

118
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>that other people aren't like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll bring like</v>

119
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 1>one of my regular friends around like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store and around some of my </v>

120
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Canadian friends that are fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll go,</v>

121
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys just talk about ridiculous </v>

122
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>shit that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's no big deal.</v>

123
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>in their world it isn't a big deal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their world,</v>

125
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>this is the normal world and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else is civilian.</v>

126
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>That's how they look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know the quote unquote </v>

127
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.721
<v Speaker 1>hardcore comedians look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in academia you have a similar </v>

128
00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>sort of a situation where they really do</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in microaggressions.</v>

129
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>They think that microaggressions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

130
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.550
<v Speaker 1>There was a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the parts of the article </v>

131
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.460
<v Speaker 1>that was really hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>

132
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to raise awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>about microaggressions,</v>

133
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.080
<v Speaker 1>but in doing so and raising awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>from microaggressions,</v>

134
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.340
<v Speaker 1>they had to give examples of these micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressions which triggered people and </v>

135
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>it's an infinite loop of victimology.</v>

136
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So this guy had to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apologized for triggering people with</v>

137
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:07.661
<v Speaker 1>his micro aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examples of them were like,</v>

138
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 1>aren't you all supposed to be good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>math to Asians like that?</v>

139
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>That is a micro aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>is it a microaggression to say good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

141
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:22.031
<v Speaker 1>This is what confuses me because like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said to a black guy,</v>

142
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys all have big Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that a microaggression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then that's saying that </v>

144
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>perpetuating racial stereotypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it a good stereotype?</v>

146
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody wants a big tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

148
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

149
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>here's another microaggression that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was hilarious.</v>

150
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm colorblind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see race.</v>

151
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see race.</v>

152
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should see race.</v>

153
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>So Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kobe,</v>

154
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:50.170
<v Speaker 1>when he says he doesn't see race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is engaging in microaggression.</v>

155
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go American.</v>

156
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The word American by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an aggression.</v>

157
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It's Americans that aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

158
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.140
<v Speaker 1>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:03.141
<v Speaker 1>because you're surfing all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>America is to imply that it's only the </v>

160
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 1>United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody saying that it's America.</v>

161
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the rest of the countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist.</v>

162
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is America is the land of </v>

163
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.150
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that is a microaggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a white.</v>

164
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that one offensive sense or here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another microaggression.</v>

165
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe the most qualified person </v>
<v Speaker 1>should get the job.</v>

166
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's illegal.</v>

167
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a meritocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

168
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.370
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it be bad for the most </v>

169
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.751
<v Speaker 1>qualified person to get a job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the whole idea of job </v>

170
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.961
<v Speaker 1>applications?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a sponsor for this podcast </v>

171
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:46.391
<v Speaker 1>called Zip recruiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of Ziprecruiter's thing is like </v>

172
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 1>if you want to fill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're trying to fill out a job,</v>

173
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>it allows you to post to like 100 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>job sites with one click and the idea is</v>

174
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:56.561
<v Speaker 1>to find the most qualified candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in turn gets you the best person </v>

175
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>for the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a microaggression.</v>

176
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So ziprecruiter is a micro aggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

177
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how horrible.</v>

178
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It's lunacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you wonder if at some point there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of auto correction of all </v>

180
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope so.</v>

181
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is what's going on </v>

182
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what a,</v>

183
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>what a lot of our culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an auto correction for the ignorance </v>

184
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and hypocrisy of like the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies and the eighties.</v>

185
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.940
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going away the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

186
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like,</v>

187
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>did you see Bernie Sanders speech get </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupted for black lives matter?</v>

188
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't think black lives matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

189
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want someone who doesn't think black </v>

190
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.420
<v Speaker 1>lives matter to speak because I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I've heard is people who,</v>

191
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>who agree black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody agrees.</v>

192
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody who doesn't think </v>

193
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that these shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police shootings are horrific,</v>

194
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.760
<v Speaker 1>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interrupt a guy who is easily the </v>

195
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.791
<v Speaker 1>most liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what was going to say is that of </v>

196
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:02.320
<v Speaker 1>all the candidates for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who is the most diverse,</v>

197
00:10:02.321 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 1>that guy will march with Martin Luther </v>
<v Speaker 1>King know he marched in the civil rights</v>

198
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:12.291
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been a civil rights advocate since </v>

199
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:15.531
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties and they interrupt his </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential speeches.</v>

200
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a theory that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

201
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the Chegg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aveiro wearing tee shirt wearing guys,</v>

203
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>they want to feel part of a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>

204
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though many of those battles </v>

205
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 1>have passed them by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been won civil rights.</v>

206
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's still racism,</v>

207
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of institutionalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>

208
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>we certainly are much better than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were 50 years ago.</v>

209
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.070
<v Speaker 1>But yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>they're young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they revolutionary.</v>

211
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>They're wearing Che Guevara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Viva La Revolution and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in this kind of behavior.</v>

213
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll watch that youtube clip and </v>

214
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>they'll think they're a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffoons.</v>

215
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very valid possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another possibility is that when</v>

216
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you look at people and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

217
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:06.171
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to find like causes to </v>

218
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people out </v>

219
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.650
<v Speaker 1>there that are just fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

220
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that allows them to get out </v>

221
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that asshole of aggression and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>

222
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>something that allows them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>righteous,</v>

224
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 1>like black lives matter.</v>

225
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's screaming at someone who </v>

226
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>believes black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

227
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone was not even remotely racist,</v>

228
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will yell it in your face the way </v>

229
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 1>they did at this Bernie Sanders thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to just get their rocks off.</v>

230
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:41.091
<v Speaker 1>Whatever personal frustrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever psychological failures that </v>

231
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>they have got bouncing around inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head,</v>

232
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever closed loop thinking they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using these valid points and </v>

233
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>these things that a lot of people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as a sounding board,</v>

234
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupting.</v>

235
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this demands attention at this moment in</v>

236
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>order to solve a problem because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking fire.</v>

237
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>We have to put this fire out right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are going to die.</v>

238
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has nothing to do with that.</v>

239
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It gives them the opportunity to grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>

240
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:18.001
<v Speaker 1>to take a moral high ground and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream out and beg for attention and to </v>

241
00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 1>be good because nobody can.</v>

242
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it like racism fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>

243
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

244
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>he can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can.</v>

246
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:31.801
<v Speaker 1>You could be like super aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really shitty and confrontational and </v>

247
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:36.661
<v Speaker 1>insulting about a cause you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is one of the problems that I </v>

248
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:41.161
<v Speaker 1>have with this whole social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior movement because I find a lot of</v>

249
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:46.591
<v Speaker 1>these people that are involved in it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be asshole human beings and even though </v>

250
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with a lot of what they support,</v>

251
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I think they suck and when I go to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter pages and I look at what their </v>

252
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.671
<v Speaker 1>interactions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their interactions are insulting </v>

253
00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:00.690
<v Speaker 1>people and getting angry at people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

254
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's all negative and I see if I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>please interject.</v>

255
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I think they don't have an ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept that people might have differing </v>

256
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

257
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I can debate many issues and yet</v>

258
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:18.661
<v Speaker 1>we can leave here both being respectful </v>
<v Speaker 1>of one another and so I think that this </v>

259
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:19.660
<v Speaker 1>course is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>

260
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 1>If you think otherwise you must be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole and I will shut you down.</v>

261
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And so they really don't have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

262
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>this critical capacity to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoned dialogue.</v>

263
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky in that I don't really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these,</v>

265
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior trolls.</v>

266
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:40.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean 99 percent of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with me are very nice and very </v>

267
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that small one to five percent group</v>

268
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you mentioned,</v>

269
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 1>are real assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impenetrable to try to speak</v>

270
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

271
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:51.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I engage them in a very dispassionate </v>

272
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:51.361
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 1>hopefully providing them with facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be polite,</v>

274
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>but I am an asshole simply for </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeing with them.</v>

275
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So most of the people that I've blocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aren't that many,</v>

276
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>but the ones that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've blocked,</v>

277
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.970
<v Speaker 1>it's because I try to engage them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way they could engage in return</v>

278
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 1>is to insult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a real,</v>

279
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:13.771
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real breakdown of civil </v>

280
00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:15.871
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also insult when it's just a matter </v>

281
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 1>of opinion about things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>debatable.</v>

282
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one that,</v>

283
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story about Occidental University or</v>

284
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Occidental College College College </v>
<v Speaker 1>Occidental College,</v>

285
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:29.461
<v Speaker 1>where there was two students that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and they're a boy and a girl.</v>

286
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>They texted each other and the boy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl had sex and the boy got accused</v>

287
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>of rape and kicked out of the school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the girls stayed and I was like,</v>

288
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

289
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

290
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're changing the rules of human </v>

291
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.721
<v Speaker 1>behavior because people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting drunk and having sex since the </v>

292
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time and so to call it rape</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

293
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>after all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just on a whim,</v>

294
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>especially when two people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>consenting adults,</v>

295
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>they're consenting adults.</v>

296
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 1>They can go to war and when they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really vote yet or 18,</v>

297
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You voted 18.</v>

298
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't drink.</v>

299
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>They can't drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're kind of Montreal,</v>

300
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal and you're crazy country.</v>

301
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that the boy is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the girls not to me seems ridiculous</v>

302
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:17.771
<v Speaker 1>and it seems contradictory to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of feminism in the first place is </v>

303
00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>that we're equal now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are equal,</v>

304
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.950
<v Speaker 1>why are we not equal in terms of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to take responsibility for being</v>

305
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>under the influence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if your.</v>

306
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>If you are responsible for being under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the influence when you're driving.</v>

307
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're responsible for being under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the influence,</v>

308
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:37.751
<v Speaker 1>if you commit violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're not responsible for being </v>

309
00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 1>under the influence when you have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a girl,</v>

310
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.470
<v Speaker 1>when I said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

312
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.471
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people that called me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massage and vanilla rape enabler and </v>

313
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.850
<v Speaker 1>enablists and ableist piece of shit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>

314
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.080
<v Speaker 1>But it was all insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how can it be insulting when </v>

315
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.080
<v Speaker 1>this is a debatable point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this co?</v>

316
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>This is a clearly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debatable point.</v>

317
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You talking about two human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are adults that got drunk,</v>

318
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 1>but the male is the rapist like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

319
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 1>There are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact details,</v>

320
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but they are now on some university </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>

321
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You actually have a consent form where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of go through the iterative </v>

322
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.120
<v Speaker 1>steps as you're starting to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

323
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So we are now in the foreplay stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you hear by consent?</v>

324
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And we pulled some like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I think putting on Barry White music </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a bit more mood inducing than </v>

326
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 1>signing a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a legal document,</v>

327
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.900
<v Speaker 1>white music as rape enabling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're doing is you're </v>

328
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 1>coercing you or making the women </v>
<v Speaker 1>aroused,</v>

329
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 1>hence they don't have all their </v>
<v Speaker 1>faculties for Barry White is a genocidal</v>

330
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 1>rapist.</v>

331
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

332
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the language that they're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>is I was unable to consent,</v>

333
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which obviously there's,</v>

334
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

335
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>We can all agree that there is a level </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are at.</v>

336
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>You are breathing deeply into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixer.</v>

337
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So we had an issue with it the other day</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's better because,</v>

338
00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

339
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 1>we got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Barry Crimmins was here and he</v>

340
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>got a little hammered and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing into the mic.</v>

341
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I got like 100 stopped people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing to the mic.</v>

342
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this,</v>

343
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this real?</v>

344
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

345
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Jake was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josie was.</v>

346
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

347
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Can Josie hooked up?</v>

348
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Josie could not consent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day jake was charged with rape.</v>

349
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

350
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a real poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

351
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember this.</v>

352
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

353
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:29.621
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a high status male seduces a lower </v>

354
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>status woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that itself could be construed as a form</v>

355
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:37.541
<v Speaker 1>of rape precisely because his powers so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating like a professor and a </v>

356
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 1>student perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in that sense,</v>

357
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might have an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>

358
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:42.130
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean forget,</v>

359
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean just a guy who meets a girl at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and he happens to be a professor.</v>

360
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.100
<v Speaker 1>The rich man and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

361
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Some of the virtue of the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

362
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.140
<v Speaker 1>that itself could be construed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>coercive because she wasn't able to </v>

363
00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 1>control herself in the face of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpowering man,</v>

364
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>not physically just because it was high </v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

365
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of being a male is if an </v>

366
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.721
<v Speaker 1>attractive woman comes onto a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's raping them because you're.</v>

367
00:18:08.811 --> 00:18:13.811
<v Speaker 1>You have no control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like of a beautiful woman comes onto a </v>

368
00:18:13.811 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 1>guy like Jamie had a bar that poor kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

369
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Jamie.</v>

370
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Jamie looking them over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked.</v>

371
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 1>If some traci lords in her prime looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick comes up.</v>

372
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reference from La.</v>

373
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I met her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still,</v>

374
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't she a porn start at 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she fit easy,</v>

375
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 1>not breck in the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

376
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe she was lighter weight.</v>

377
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Since we're on a porn references.</v>

378
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you maybe the greatest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

379
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:44.190

<v Speaker 1>I received a lot of comments on my </v>

380
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.741
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the greatest one I've ever </v>

381
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:45.741
<v Speaker 1>received.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wrote,</v>

382
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm getting the exact quote in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to me.</v>

383
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:52.581
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is the Ron Jeremy of </v>

384
00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:53.230
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

385
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

386
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I could drop the mic and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.950
<v Speaker 1>retire well that means you're disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>but effective fat and sweaty and Harry,</v>

388
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

389
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing about Ron Jeremy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ron.</v>

390
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy existed in an era where the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to be gross because people</v>

391
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>watching porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all guys.</v>

392
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 1>So you wanted like a guy who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting to be getting late.</v>

393
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance this could happen.</v>

394
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Look how hot she hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fucks Ron.</v>

395
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

396
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays the men are equally </v>

397
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.470
<v Speaker 1>unattainable as well.</v>

398
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that the women watch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with men,</v>

399
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>

400
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

401
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure porns raping their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

402
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that was contacted once a by a former </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn star who had already uh,</v>

403
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

404
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.390
<v Speaker 1>he had the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the NBA,</v>

405
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I think an Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to pursue his phd with me.</v>

406
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 1>He actually came up to Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend a few days with me,</v>

407
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.050
<v Speaker 1>visited my lab and then ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

408
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.080
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going on for a phd,</v>

409
00:19:58.081 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's my,</v>

410
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:01.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closest I've come to a porn star,</v>

411
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 1>a guy who almost became a doctoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>

412
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

413
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't even say his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a man who does that has a bit </v>

414
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.630
<v Speaker 1>more freedom to move around over a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

415
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>She's sort of labeled by our culture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a weird way.</v>

416
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe less so in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Canada I think in terms of as,</v>

417
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>or a little bit more loose sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're,</v>

418
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you've been to Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there recently,</v>

419
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every second to store stores.</v>

420
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>A strip bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 1>You guys have a lot of strip bars up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

422
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's also just the way people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and act about sex.</v>

423
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.280
<v Speaker 1>It just seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem shameful,</v>

424
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.230
<v Speaker 1>less puritanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

425
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.440
<v Speaker 1>we're so fucking boys in Quebec is even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more so what you're saying because it.</v>

426
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good that European vibe.</v>

427
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the,</v>

428
00:20:48.691 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>in the context of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the Anglo Saxon provinces </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically might be closer to </v>

430
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Munter,</v>

431
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Kobeck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a free for all.</v>

432
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut back is crazy.</v>

433
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more um,</v>

434
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.260
<v Speaker 1>conservative spots are where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people and everyone's scared </v>

435
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.401
<v Speaker 1>and you believe in Jesus more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to Saskatchewan if you want to </v>

436
00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:11.401
<v Speaker 1>get lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

437
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan,</v>

438
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan right now they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming up their fingers for hate mail.</v>

439
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is in America too.</v>

440
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like the spots that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

441
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of people there in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere.</v>

442
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking church everywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those spots.</v>

443
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that in a Latin America or </v>

444
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Central America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Costa Rica recently,</v>

445
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>and the poorer the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prevalence of churches was like </v>

446
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

447
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 1>We were driving to the cloud for us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're driving up there,</v>

448
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:46.231
<v Speaker 1>you pass her all these really small </v>
<v Speaker 1>rural communities and you see a lot of </v>

449
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:46.231
<v Speaker 1>churches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people,</v>

451
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:51.961
<v Speaker 1>I guess they need hope in those spots </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are kind of solves the biggest </v>

452
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>potential mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything people keep </v>

464
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 1>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie gave me seven.</v>

465
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

466
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that um,</v>

467
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.830
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential angst of a,</v>

468
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.840
<v Speaker 1>of death being solved by religion for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people is like a nice little </v>

469
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 1>scaffolding to just sorta like carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>your way through life.</v>

470
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have gotten angry at me for </v>

471
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:44.880
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that I'm not suggesting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you or for anybody.</v>

472
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

473
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:50.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people do that I wouldn't </v>

474
00:22:50.401 --> 00:22:54.721
<v Speaker 1>want to do that they do to kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 1>by in this life or it's takes Xanax or </v>

475
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:55.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.720
<v Speaker 1>or drink every night after work in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep from kicking their dog.</v>

477
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is going on </v>

478
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.581
<v Speaker 1>in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of people in these bad </v>

479
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>rural type situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be like,</v>

480
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.720
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be a common theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

481
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And if you really look at everything as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being natural,</v>

482
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>which is I what I try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that term nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to look at that as like </v>

484
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 1>wild life outside of cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of look at everything as nature </v>

485
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.180
<v Speaker 1>and I look at human behavior patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much they repeat themselves as </v>

486
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.460
<v Speaker 1>being pretty natural and these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>little spots where there's not a lot of </v>

487
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to attract a lot of churches.</v>

488
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

489
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article on that point that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think maybe a year or two ago looking,</v>

490
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 1>it was somebody else's research that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was summarizing,</v>

491
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>looking at the content</v>

492
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 2>of prayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that people pray about </v>

493
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.700
<v Speaker 2>money as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a function of their income </v>

494
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic status,</v>

495
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.700
<v Speaker 2>and as you might predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

496
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.840
<v Speaker 2>the content of what I pray to God about </v>
<v Speaker 2>drastically changes as a function of </v>

497
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:05.910
<v Speaker 2>where I fit in that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do people that are really rich pray</v>

498
00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:08.760
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe health must be right?</v>

499
00:24:08.761 --> 00:24:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health and family and stuff like that.</v>

500
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

501
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.430
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

502
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reluctantly,</v>

503
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just accepted but I can almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported because you mean religiosity.</v>

504
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people that are in bad places and </v>

505
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 2>bad situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that it helps.</v>

506
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so chapter eight of one of my books is I</v>

507
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:39.290
<v Speaker 2>titled it very provocatively perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing hope by selling lies,</v>

508
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I give different examples of hope </v>

509
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>peddlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a medical quacks,</v>

510
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 2>a self help gurus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course I argued that the greatest</v>

511
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.680
<v Speaker 2>peddler of hope is of course religion.</v>

512
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're exactly right.</v>

513
00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:57.301
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes almost a maladaptive </v>

514
00:24:57.301 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 2>honesty to not believe because it is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more comforting to believe.</v>

515
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 2>And also the people that decide not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

516
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:08.021
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like they have to try so </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard in those areas to not believe that </v>

517
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:12.851
<v Speaker 2>they become angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can become angry about their </v>

518
00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:12.851
<v Speaker 2>disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

519
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a nonbeliever,</v>

520
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very gentle.</v>

521
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very intelligent man.</v>

522
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize these patterns and not </v>

523
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 2>succumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a lot of folks,</v>

524
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of folks also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with so many people in </v>

525
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>your community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are also a part of that.</v>

526
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 2>And then the church becomes like a sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a community center by proxy.</v>

527
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 2>What David Sloan Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a evolutionary biologist,</v>

528
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:37.880
<v Speaker 2>a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very famous biologist,</v>

529
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.120
<v Speaker 2>he looks at the evolutionary roots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and he actually argues a great </v>

530
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:48.671
<v Speaker 2>book I'm doing is plugging for him now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think he wrote in 2002 Darwin's </v>

531
00:25:48.671 --> 00:25:52.721
<v Speaker 2>Cathedral where he actually demonstrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>or argued that groups that are religious</v>

532
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 2>actually out survive.</v>

533
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Those that are not using an argument of </v>
<v Speaker 2>commonality,</v>

534
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:03.401
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Groups that are religious are more </v>

535
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:03.401
<v Speaker 2>cohesive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Band together are more communal,</v>

536
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.130
<v Speaker 2>therefore they should be able to survive</v>
<v Speaker 2>other groups.</v>

537
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

538
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.970
<v Speaker 2>his theories are a bit contentious </v>
<v Speaker 2>because many evolutionary psychologists </v>

539
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 2>and evolutionary biologists reject the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that evolution can happen at the </v>

540
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.951
<v Speaker 2>group level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They argue that evolution should happen </v>

541
00:26:20.951 --> 00:26:20.951
<v Speaker 2>at the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the gene level,</v>

542
00:26:20.951 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>and this is a fight that he's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>having for many years now,</v>

543
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's one example where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually study religion not only from a </v>

544
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

545
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who lives in a married </v>
<v Speaker 2>male and female are married in a sort of</v>

546
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:41.090
<v Speaker 2>a rural area and a long time ago I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation with them,</v>

547
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the,</v>

548
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>the wife was</v>

549
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>just sort of explaining how if it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>for religion,</v>

550
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.900
<v Speaker 1>her and the husband wouldn't be together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way she was saying it was </v>

551
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.770
<v Speaker 1>counseling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband was dumb and like he needs </v>

552
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 1>something to keep him like on this good </v>
<v Speaker 1>path and pattern.</v>

553
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And they'd been married for like at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

554
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I think like 15 or 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

555
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:10.731
<v Speaker 1>do you think that we would have still </v>
<v Speaker 1>been together if it wasn't for our </v>

556
00:27:10.731 --> 00:27:13.821
<v Speaker 1>belief in God and Lord and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not an edge goes whether or not it's </v>

557
00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

558
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

559
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:18.050
<v Speaker 1>this is some heavy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like she's given her husband</v>

560
00:27:18.051 --> 00:27:23.051
<v Speaker 1>some sort of placebo to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep this guy from drinking and fucking </v>

561
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 1>getting on a train like a Hobo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell she do.</v>

562
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like God kinda kept them together and </v>

563
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:31.880
<v Speaker 1>kept the family together.</v>

564
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 1>But she was looking at it in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic way and I was like,</v>

565
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is deep,</v>

566
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East.</v>

567
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:41.661
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen it in my own family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this incredible fatalism that </v>

568
00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:44.300
<v Speaker 1>comes with religiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a family member of.</v>

569
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.430

<v Speaker 1>it's God's will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he opens up a store and the store </v>

579
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.021
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not that he might have made </v>

580
00:28:18.021 --> 00:28:20.841
<v Speaker 1>some bad poor business decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be God's will had God wanted it </v>

581
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 1>to be differently than things would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out differently.</v>

582
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that type of fatalism is actually </v>

583
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 1>quite a depressing and that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow for a feedback loop.</v>

584
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

585
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.460
<v Speaker 1>you don't get feedback from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that says change course of </v>

586
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.521
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everything that happens happens </v>

587
00:28:40.521 --> 00:28:42.801
<v Speaker 1>because it's God's will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really just an empty vessel </v>

588
00:28:42.801 --> 00:28:44.430
<v Speaker 1>that's just executing God's will and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and you see that a lot in the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>

590
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 1>If God wants and child life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

591
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if God,</v>

592
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:53.421
<v Speaker 1>that if it meant if it was meant to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really part of the loss of the </v>

593
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Arabic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice and feedback loops are what</v>

594
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 1>it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

595
00:28:57.241 --> 00:29:02.241
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is when you're opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>a business or doing a sport or you know,</v>

596
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:07.941
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practiced resume reviewing data feedback</v>

597
00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 1>loop making possible corrections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectivity.</v>

598
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are what makes people </v>

599
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And matter of fact,</v>

600
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I read an article recently about music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were there,</v>

601
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.900
<v Speaker 1>were there were discussing music that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inherent qualities of someone's </v>

602
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.381
<v Speaker 1>music or really just a lot of what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great musician his practice and </v>

603
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:31.250
<v Speaker 1>feedback loops right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

604
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Not God's will but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you believe that,</v>

605
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's limiting and empowering at the same</v>

606
00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:38.060
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

607
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Because if you also are involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice feedback,</v>

608
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>but you really think God's</v>

609
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.300
<v Speaker 2>on your side because you play a mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mean acts,</v>

610
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a psychological trait </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maps onto what we're talking about.</v>

611
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a locus of control.</v>

612
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with this term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>

613
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

614
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:59.370
<v Speaker 2>So locus of control is basically ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us are internally driven in </v>

615
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:03.781
<v Speaker 2>terms of our locus of control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that we attribute things that </v>

616
00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:03.781
<v Speaker 2>happened to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us,</v>

617
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I did well on the exam because I studied</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard because I'm intelligent.</v>

618
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Versus external locus of control as you </v>

619
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 2>attributed to environmental factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did poorly on the exam,</v>

620
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 2>not because I didn't study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because the professor is an asshole.</v>

621
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.690
<v Speaker 2>He's an Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

622
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And so people who score high on external</v>
<v Speaker 2>locus of control,</v>

623
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 2>then you can predict certain other </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors,</v>

624
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're much more likely to be gamblers.</v>

625
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because it's fatalism,</v>

626
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:30.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

627
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my turn will come.</v>

628
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 2>It's written in the skies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

629
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 2>the black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be up soon,</v>

630
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're internally locus of control,</v>

631
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 2>then you know that all that stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>random and they're red and black or just</v>

632
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 2>they come and go depending on how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball drops.</v>

633
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

634
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:50.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people do really firmly </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in that.</v>

635
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's sort of there.</v>

636
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.450
<v Speaker 2>That's how they get through this life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very much a blinder.</v>

637
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It puts them in a very narrow channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to escape.</v>

638
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Once you have that firm belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know of have that.</v>

639
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 2>These patterns are sort of clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>

640
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be my time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My time is coming.</v>

641
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Well my time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to the gambling casinos,</v>

642
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:20.191
<v Speaker 2>actually our operators are very spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They play on that cognitive illusion </v>

643
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 2>because what they do is they give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>this card where you keep track of how </v>

644
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 2>many times it's come on read and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

645
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 2>how many times the number 13 has come as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complete illusion,</v>

646
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

647
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.930
<v Speaker 2>It's giving you a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could take a car so when you play </v>

648
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:36.930
<v Speaker 2>relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

649
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to the Montreal casino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get those cars.</v>

650
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 has come up 14 times,</v>

651
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think 37 is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should be up soon.</v>

652
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it's doing basically is it's giving</v>

653
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you a sense of control over otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely random events.</v>

654
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:55.621
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of those throws the ball are </v>

655
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 2>independent events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

656
00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.750
<v Speaker 2>unless it's a rig machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the casino operators understand you </v>

657
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 2>and psychology and they play on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the idiot succumb to it.</v>

658
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 2>How rude.</v>

659
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.830
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

660
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

661
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 2>But what's crazy is when luck is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their side,</v>

662
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 2>it seems real like when you get a hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>

663
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:18.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't play craps,</v>

664
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:21.400
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen people play craps and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a hot hand.</v>

665
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 2>They start rolling dice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

666
00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 2>And they feel like they can lose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go on a hot streak.</v>

667
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 2>They'll go on a hot streak with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Black Jack as well.</v>

668
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.370
<v Speaker 2>They get the right cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poker and it feels like it's happening.</v>

669
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.240
<v Speaker 2>But because that hot streak is itself a </v>
<v Speaker 2>random pattern,</v>

670
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great story and I'll</v>

671
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>actually mention who it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he won't be upset if I mentioned </v>

672
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my father who is a avid six,</v>

673
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 3>49 player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Bet your dad doesn't listen to this </v>

674
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not 6:49</v>

675
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:52.370
<v Speaker 3>basically is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a lottery game played in Quebec.</v>

676
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you choose six numbers out of 49.</v>

677
00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Your chances of getting it are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

678
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:02.310
<v Speaker 3>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really small and so one day he </v>

679
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 3>had called me at the office at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>university office,</v>

680
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.150
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey son,</v>

681
00:33:04.151 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing some,</v>

682
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some cards.</v>

683
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Give me six numbers and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

684
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>that I have some students in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I call you back because it just,</v>

685
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 3>just give me six numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

686
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

687
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:13.850
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

688
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:14.240
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

689
00:33:14.241 --> 00:33:15.380
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he goes,</v>

690
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:20.381
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not going to take the damn </v>

691
00:33:20.381 --> 00:33:20.381
<v Speaker 3>game seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I calling you right now?</v>

692
00:33:20.381 --> 00:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Why did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he actually was convinced that </v>

693
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>the numbers one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

694
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

695
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

696
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.271
<v Speaker 3>and I bet some of your listeners will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will also think that the numbers one </v>

697
00:33:28.271 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 3>through six are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

698
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.880
<v Speaker 3>is less likely of a combination to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up than any other combination of six </v>

699
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 3>numbers simply because it has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>illusion of of looking ordered.</v>

700
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it isn't.</v>

701
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:43.630
<v Speaker 3>It is just one of the 14 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible combinations that I think it's </v>

702
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>one out of $40 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

703
00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:45.560
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these biases,</v>

704
00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:50.561
<v Speaker 3>these cognitive traps are so alluring </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so easy for people to succumb </v>

705
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:54.431
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it single digit numbers can be </v>

706
00:33:54.431 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 3>doubled if it goes up to 49,</v>
<v Speaker 3>49 digits?</v>

707
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:54.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

708
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Forty nine numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One to 49.</v>

709
00:33:57.081 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 3>You pick your six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>

710
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>39,</v>

711
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 3>42.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just picked one through six and</v>

712
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:08.531
<v Speaker 3>he was absolutely convinced that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of six numbers is simply </v>

713
00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 3>that you're a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an idiot.</v>

714
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>The lottery itself is such a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother used to only talk about </v>

715
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.091
<v Speaker 1>the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She talked about the lottery and dead </v>

716
00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>people that were talking to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother was like,</v>

717
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.530
<v Speaker 1>she was crazy and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

718
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.800
<v Speaker 1>she firmly believed that she had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic ability,</v>

719
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

720
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 1>she's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that number was going to come up.</v>

721
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:37.390
<v Speaker 1>She would always tell you I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bet that she would talk about what </v>

722
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.931
<v Speaker 1>number she was going to bet and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to bet nine that didn't put it in </v>

723
00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 through sick too,</v>

724
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she rattle off whatever the fuck the </v>

725
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:49.271
<v Speaker 1>number was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was back in the day in New </v>

726
00:34:49.271 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Jersey where I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play the numbers,</v>

727
00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:55.320
<v Speaker 1>which is like this local created sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery that the mob ran.</v>

728
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It was this weird thing and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother was a part of it.</v>

729
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 1>She would like help run the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

730
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

731
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:04.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what her function was,</v>

732
00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:09.941
<v Speaker 1>but she was a part of it to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she got arrested and did six </v>

733
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.950
<v Speaker 1>months in jail and they're running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and she wouldn't,</v>

734
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't rat anybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

735
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother would like a knit,</v>

737
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 1>like little scarves and shit for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards.</v>

738
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And do all kinds of weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find out about this until later</v>

739
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just thought grandma was just fucking</v>

740
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 1>busy traveling or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no idea where the hell she was.</v>

741
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 1>We'd go visit grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's grandma?</v>

742
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't find her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

743
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:38.231
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's visiting your aunt Mary or she's </v>

744
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:38.231
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:38.231
<v Speaker 1>it was always like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really she</v>

746
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 2>was in the pokey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

747
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Doing hard time for numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So speaking of kind of Kooky a family </v>

748
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:48.840
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a paternal aunt and I've actually</v>

749
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:50.990
<v Speaker 2>written about this general what tasks </v>
<v Speaker 2>geography is.</v>

750
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a fancy term for something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might otherwise not.</v>

751
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Does that term go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tasha Griffey is the reading of your </v>

752
00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.820
<v Speaker 2>fate since we're talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues through a.</v>

753
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 2>In the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it with the tea leaves or that you</v>

754
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 2>could do with [inaudible] or you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it with the residue.</v>

755
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what you flip over the coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>mug.</v>

756
00:36:08.831 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 2>That right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the residue that's left,</v>

757
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what you read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this lady would come over to our </v>

758
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 2>house and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

759
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

760
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:22.281
<v Speaker 2>nine year old boy and I already knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Jig was up on this thing and </v>

761
00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:22.281
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she would come over,</v>

762
00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:23.570
<v Speaker 2>it would be like the pope is visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

763
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

764
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 2>And lower rise coming over to tell us </v>
<v Speaker 2>about our future.</v>

765
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 2>So then she would start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd look at these,</v>

766
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.600
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these random patterns and the things </v>

767
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:35.600
<v Speaker 2>that you would say are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I see happiness in your future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I could have a good bowel movement </v>

769
00:36:39.001 --> 00:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>later and that's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dallas cowboys could win.</v>

770
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.690
<v Speaker 2>That's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife and I can have sex tonight.</v>

771
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Then that's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was no way to falsify her </v>

772
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 2>profoundly general prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

773
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

774
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 2>she never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never looked at the,</v>

775
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:58.010
<v Speaker 2>at the residue and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be getting a 13 point seven </v>

776
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.520
<v Speaker 2>percent increase in your income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

777
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Specificity is the enemy of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortune tellers.</v>

778
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they give you these vague predictions</v>

779
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 2>which you could then fill into your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any infinite number of possible ways.</v>

780
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had this guy on the Scifi show that </v>

781
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.931
<v Speaker 2>it did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Bennett check and he's a </v>

782
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 2>master at what he calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it mentalism or something like</v>

783
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 2>that and he's a mentalist.</v>

784
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is one of those guys that will tell </v>

785
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 2>you absolutely straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is bullshit.</v>

786
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am using tricks and I won't tell you </v>

787
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 2>what the tricks are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will tell you right now,</v>

788
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I am not a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not magic.</v>

789
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Magic is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually gets angry at people that </v>

790
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 2>pretend that they could read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you remember,</v>

791
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.400
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole series of those shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've since pulled off the air,</v>

792
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 2>but where there was psychics and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

793
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like the long island medium,</v>

794
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:50.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

795
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>And they were talking to people's dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatives and all those are some that do</v>

796
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 2>with dead animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't one of those things.</v>

797
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 2>There's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

798
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.970
<v Speaker 2>So there is a cross species psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine your fucking dog doesn't</v>

799
00:38:02.971 --> 00:38:06.570
<v Speaker 2>say Jack Shit to you when he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he's dead,</v>

800
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 2>he starts talking to psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

801
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

802
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the way you pet me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro,</v>

803
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 2>at the back of my head like I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

804
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

805
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:16.230
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

806
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Speaker 2>this idea that someone can actually read</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your past and pull this information</v>

807
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>is so appealing to people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake the way the person's questioning</v>

808
00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:34.521
<v Speaker 2>them and the clues and the little bits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of information that they give and how </v>

809
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>this person is really just good</v>

810
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>at forming puzzles based on pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunking.</v>

811
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just know how to.</v>

812
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 1>They know they've done this so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times they know how to get it,</v>

813
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:49.021
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he told me what he was </v>

814
00:38:49.021 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had some people in the audience.</v>

815
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 1>We had a small audience and we had him </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform these tasks and these folks have</v>

816
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>them come up and he would ask them </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

817
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

818
00:38:57.521 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>he's just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

819
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that you knew all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks,</v>

820
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to sort of succumb to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>

821
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the tricks.</v>

822
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I just know they are tracked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't tell us what the tricks </v>

823
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.630
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

824
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

825
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I am not a psychic by any stretch of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

826
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 1>And he did a bunch of other cool stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you bent spoons and stuff like that</v>

827
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 1>with his mind.</v>

828
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>

829
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all bullshit.</v>

830
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm using trickery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

831
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but I won't tell you how I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not magic.</v>

832
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Which would be really rude if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually was magic and it's just like </v>

833
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.971
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shtick is calling out all these </v>

834
00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:33.400
<v Speaker 1>other people who were also actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>

835
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that it was like a sellout for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the real magic people.</v>

836
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister was in high school.</v>

837
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>She went to one of her friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

838
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:46.230
<v Speaker 1>hired a psychic and they all sat around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this psychic would like,</v>

839
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.980
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

840
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always very skeptical of stuff like </v>

841
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.921
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the time I was little because I </v>

842
00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:55.921
<v Speaker 1>knew my grandmother was fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she always claimed to be psychic,</v>

843
00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but listen to my sister come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would tell me all this stuff,</v>

844
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knew all about this and she knew all</v>

845
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:04.120
<v Speaker 1>about that and she knew about the time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that and I'm like,</v>

846
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't you know about all that stuff?</v>

847
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 1>She's not telling you anything you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>already know.</v>

848
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 1>So she's telling you stuff you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

849
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

850
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

851
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 1>how is it amazing that she tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that you already know what?</v>

852
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 1>That's not amazing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a study,</v>

853
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:24.271
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the exact reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could take the astrological </v>

854
00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 1>predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

855
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the twelfth and you're giving it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people randomly and anyone that I give </v>

856
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.991
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be able to argue that perfectly </v>

857
00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:33.991
<v Speaker 1>fits you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

858
00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

859
00:40:34.611 --> 00:40:39.611
<v Speaker 1>Because it is so vague that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>infuse your life into any one of these </v>

860
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of vague the script for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

861
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ultra vague.</v>

862
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those are stupid.</v>

863
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:48.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those today will be an amazing day for </v>

864
00:40:48.721 --> 00:40:48.721
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck,</v>

865
00:40:48.721 --> 00:40:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to know specifics.</v>

866
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had a friend who ran into someone </v>

867
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.640
<v Speaker 1>in Venice beach and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

868
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.700
<v Speaker 1>one of those save the rain forest type </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>

869
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 1>He had like some little stands up and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

870
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:02.590
<v Speaker 1>if I guess your birthday will you listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me?</v>

871
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 1>And my friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

872
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And he gets his birthday on the day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he was,</v>

873
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck did you do that?</v>

874
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you listen to my story now?</v>

875
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But the rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

876
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 1>do that to my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought his friend over and he gets </v>

877
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>his friend's birthday to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

878
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.590
<v Speaker 1>To what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

879
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

880
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reserving judgment on that story </v>

881
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.240
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know it's a true story.</v>

882
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Speaker 1>My friend definitely didn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's because he's baffled by it.</v>

883
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Here's where I told Penn Jillette </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

884
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

885
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magician rather.</v>

886
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And a good friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

887
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>how's this guy do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

888
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:38.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's techniques you can do that.</v>

889
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with it?</v>

890
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Man Guys shows up and he says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I can guess your birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know you.</v>

892
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is that possible?</v>

893
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 1>And he told me there's techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

894
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

895
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:59.170
<v Speaker 1>There's 365 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that guy going to guess that </v>

896
00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 1>William stumped and it's not even one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>365,</v>

897
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odds of you nailing it,</v>

898
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it's probably higher than one and 365,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

899
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That are.</v>

900
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 1>There are interesting probabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

901
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:13.811
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to say how likely are to </v>

902
00:42:13.811 --> 00:42:15.950
<v Speaker 1>people in a room to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday,</v>

903
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.400
<v Speaker 1>that number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember what I've seen a </v>

904
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>lot longer than you think it is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than you think.</v>

905
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot higher than you.</v>

906
00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I took probability and stats,</v>

907
00:42:25.241 --> 00:42:25.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.660
<v Speaker 1>as a math on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one and sort of the classic </v>

909
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.331
<v Speaker 1>examples that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your study precisely because it is so </v>

910
00:42:34.331 --> 00:42:34.331
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive.</v>

911
00:42:34.331 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a show where someone did that </v>

912
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.830
<v Speaker 1>and they went into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of these conmen dudes </v>

913
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 1>went into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bet people and he went into a Oh,</v>

914
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:49.460
<v Speaker 1>like a restaurant and he had like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to find two people.</v>

915
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:54.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like certain amount of time to find two </v>

916
00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:54.461
<v Speaker 1>people that share the same birthday that</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked there or that,</v>

917
00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:58.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're in a customer's there and he </v>

918
00:42:58.991 --> 00:42:58.991
<v Speaker 1>nailed it in like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

920
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

921
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of people coming in and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like a May twelfth or whatever the </v>

922

923
00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:10.961
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that someone could just </v>

924
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:13.091
<v Speaker 1>point at you godfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe your bus stalling and Axon </v>

925
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.350
<v Speaker 1>came out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gad Fad,</v>

926
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 1>fad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

927
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how anybody does that,</v>

928
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:24.131
<v Speaker 1>but according to Penn Jillette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to listen to him though because </v>

929
00:43:24.131 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking magician and those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all tricksters.</v>

930
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.400
<v Speaker 1>They know how to do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the cool things about Penn </v>

931
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever go to wash them,</v>

932
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.300
<v Speaker 1>is that they'll tell you it's bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're doing it.</v>

933
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And you have no idea what the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just did,</v>

934
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:35.690
<v Speaker 1>how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

935
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all really sneaky stuff is just </v>

936
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 1>managing illusions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

937
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing.</v>

938
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's really cool about the </v>

939
00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 1>band check character was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really adamant about that stuff and</v>

940
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:53.231
<v Speaker 1>very angry about people steal money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks by claiming to be mediums and </v>

941
00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>talking to their relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

942
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:59.831
<v Speaker 1>I just think that anyone who would try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give someone hope that perhaps their </v>

943
00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:04.421
<v Speaker 1>dead relative is talking from the grave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and telling them important things they </v>

944
00:44:04.421 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 1>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile they're just making it up.</v>

945
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just a foul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting human being.</v>

946
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother would have bought it,</v>

947
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker.</v>

948
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 1>She believed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

949
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 1>We had a dude a dye in my grandmother's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

950
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

951
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:22.900
<v Speaker 1>during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

952
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like the fifties or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

953
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were pretty poor and there was this</v>

954
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 1>guy in the neighborhood who needed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to live</v>

955
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 3>and he would pay them to rent a room in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their house.</v>

956
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Is Pretty common back in those days and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

957
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 3>sometimes we'd eat dinner with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you.</v>

958
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.620
<v Speaker 3>And he died in his room one day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that this guy was talking </v>

959
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:51.291
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe this guy was in the house </v>

960
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:51.291
<v Speaker 3>and that she would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

961
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:54.770
<v Speaker 3>go up into the attic sometimes and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be up there and she would see him </v>

962
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.770
<v Speaker 3>and talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

963
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 3>freaked me the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

964
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 3>It's very creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever hear,</v>

965
00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if I'm going to get her </v>
<v Speaker 3>name right.</v>

966
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Emily Rose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Others that name now,</v>

967
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 3>the youngest woman or girl to ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>publish.</v>

968
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of relate to some of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>hocus pocus stuff that we're talking </v>

969
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.040
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youngest girl to ever publish a paper in</v>

970
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:16.041
<v Speaker 3>Jama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journal of the American Medical </v>

971
00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very prestigious journal.</v>

972
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I think she was maybe nine or 10 or 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I discussed this in one of my books.</v>

973
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and basically as a great four or five a </v>

974
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 3>science project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wanted to explore touch therapy.</v>

975
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you familiar with windows?</v>

976
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.390
<v Speaker 3>So touch therapy is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>quackery.</v>

977
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 3>But I'm triggered right now by you </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

978
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

979
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Just triggered me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

980
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

981
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.660
<v Speaker 3>so basically it's the touch healer has </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of energy and in his or her </v>

982
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 3>hands that they can sort of levitate </v>
<v Speaker 3>around your pain area,</v>

983
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.700
<v Speaker 3>like Reiki,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reiki,</v>

984
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

985
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she wanted to test whether those </v>

986
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.941
<v Speaker 3>claims were true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she set up a extraordinarily simple </v>

987
00:46:01.941 --> 00:46:06.500
<v Speaker 3>experiment to test their abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what basically she did is she </v>

988
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:12.051
<v Speaker 3>would put out her hand and then they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to determine whether it's her right </v>

989
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

990
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:13.460
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

991
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.000
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

992
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a barrier where they can't see which of </v>

993
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 3>her hands is out and they have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability of touch.</v>

994
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 3>They should be able to predict whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the right or left,</v>

995
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:30.201
<v Speaker 3>this is where her hand is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course they ended up doing worse </v>

996
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 3>than random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

997
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 3>less than 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

998
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 3>you have one in two chance of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>guessing randomly whether it's the right</v>

999
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.190
<v Speaker 3>or left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1000
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 3>And she demonstrated that these touch </v>
<v Speaker 3>healers,</v>

1001
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.640
<v Speaker 3>who supposedly are able to cure cancer </v>
<v Speaker 3>by levitating their hand over areas are </v>

1002
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.381
<v Speaker 3>not even able to predict whether the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand that's out is on the right or left.</v>

1003
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1004
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>so imagine what an elegant experiment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>

1005
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.090
<v Speaker 3>And it was published in that journal </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1006
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>What do you think those touch healers </v>
<v Speaker 3>came back with as a rebuttal?</v>

1007
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Can you think of anything new other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1008
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically said that when you,</v>

1009
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 3>when you set up these types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments in a laboratory that ends up</v>

1010
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.040
<v Speaker 3>wait for it affecting the energy fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And therefore by testing our abilities,</v>

1011
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you are ultimately removing our </v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities.</v>

1012
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Therefore it's an unfalsifiable </v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

1013
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard that expression.</v>

1014
00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that thought of when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about people who don't </v>

1015
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:37.820
<v Speaker 1>believe in psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1016
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 1>And that if you talk to a psychic but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe in them,</v>

1017
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.140
<v Speaker 1>your negative energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fears with their gift.</v>

1018
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>

1019
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.970
<v Speaker 1>So how could you ever tested right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can that.</v>

1020
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why all of these sort of quackery</v>

1021
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 1>movements are part of the sort of non </v>
<v Speaker 1>science epidemiology,</v>

1022
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Destiny,</v>

1023
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of destiny.</v>

1024
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 1>If I walk out of my house now and I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by a car,</v>

1025
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that was my destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I go ahead,</v>

1026
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please go to.</v>

1027
00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 1>If I walk out of my house and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit by trucks,</v>

1028
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 1>that was my destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what state of the world would have to</v>

1029
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 1>happen for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to be able to test the destiny or</v>

1030
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.210
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing,</v>

1031
00:48:15.211 --> 00:48:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1032
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Anything that happens is my destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1033
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's unfalsifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1034
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1035
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 1>a little piece of Hocus pocus that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1036
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1037
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment from time to time and that</v>

1038
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:35.581
<v Speaker 1>is synchronicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're discussing an object </v>

1039
00:48:35.581 --> 00:48:39.481
<v Speaker 1>and then something will come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on television or the news </v>

1040
00:48:39.481 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that just perfectly fits into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>

1041
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1042
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 1>how God damned convenient is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was having a,</v>

1043
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:47.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a text,</v>

1044
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:52.140
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning and he lives on the east </v>

1045
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.921
<v Speaker 1>coast and I live in the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going back and forth and he's </v>

1046
00:48:55.921 --> 00:48:58.591
<v Speaker 1>having health issues and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to a doctor about probiotics and </v>

1047
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.160
<v Speaker 1>while we're having this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go downstairs and I'm about to work </v>

1048
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:10.411
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turn on the television and good </v>

1049
00:49:10.411 --> 00:49:12.601
<v Speaker 1>morning America is having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an expert discuss probiotics and how gut</v>

1050
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 1>health can affect all sorts of various </v>
<v Speaker 1>things including your mood,</v>

1051
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of various illnesses.</v>

1052
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And like literally at the same moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having this text conversation with </v>

1053
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:29.731
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take a photo of the television and </v>

1054
00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:29.731
<v Speaker 1>I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent it to him and like,</v>

1055
00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:32.260
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about this and Bam,</v>

1056
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it's on tv like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I,</v>

1057
00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 1>they mystify that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to fuck it up for me?</v>

1058
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Man would do apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually called the cell a bias.</v>

1059
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

1060
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 1>every time I get in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone rings,</v>

1062
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:48.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1063
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Habits me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1064
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.220
<v Speaker 1>What are the events that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>coding in your brain,</v>

1065
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.170
<v Speaker 1>so the other times the phone rang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no locks on the phone can ring or cannot</v>

1066
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 1>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could get into the shower or not</v>

1067
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.620
<v Speaker 1>get into the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a two by two matrix.</v>

1068
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Speaker 1>The brain is only coding the instances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell a bias.</v>

1069
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 1>One of the biopsies were the two events </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1070
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 1>the phone rings and I get in the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three other events.</v>

1071
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Your brain never codes because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not events.</v>

1072
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Therefore you end up overestimating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of that event.</v>

1073
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time the phone rings,</v>

1074
00:50:21.641 --> 00:50:26.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is what's happening with that </v>

1075
00:50:26.641 --> 00:50:26.641
<v Speaker 1>probiotic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1076
00:50:26.641 --> 00:50:30.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a million other times that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke him about something else and then </v>

1077
00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:34.301
<v Speaker 1>you turned on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't to use your term </v>

1078
00:50:34.301 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 1>synchronicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that one time where it happened,</v>

1079
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 1>you code it as as something magical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystical.</v>

1080
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1081
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't seem very buying your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit or all men.</v>

1082
00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So you're sticking with your magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

1083
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Say The universe is a all working </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to sort of.</v>

1084
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That science stuff is overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a lot of it's bullshit,</v>

1085
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right here.</v>

1086
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do.</v>

1087
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it was a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence,</v>

1088
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a series of these beautiful </v>

1089
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.801
<v Speaker 1>coincidences that happen all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're tuned in the vibe of the </v>

1090
00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1091
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1092
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.110
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1093
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to recover from that.</v>

1094
00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1095
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big one,</v>

1096
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:27.431
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vibe of the universe at moving away </v>

1097
00:51:27.431 --> 00:51:30.551
<v Speaker 1>from spiritual death or do you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about some real science or do you </v>

1098
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:30.551
<v Speaker 1>want to join the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no and absolutely.</v>

1099
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So man,</v>

1100
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

1101
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1102
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:35.630
<v Speaker 1>for people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he serious?</v>

1103
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1104
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 1>we're joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1105
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it is weird when stuff like that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do wonder why do you familiar?</v>

1106
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:48.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you are with simulation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a bit about it to see what you </v>

1107
00:51:48.461 --> 00:51:49.310
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simulation theory is the idea,</v>

1108
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is not just being bandied about</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Comedians,</v>

1109
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but by actual physicist who contemplate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1110
00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:00.220
<v Speaker 1>when you extrapolate the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and where we're at now and </v>

1111
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:04.271
<v Speaker 1>what's possible today with Oculus rift </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these virtual reality programs </v>

1112
00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that are developing that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily effective.</v>

1113
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:12.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen the newest version of </v>

1114
00:52:12.521 --> 00:52:12.530
<v Speaker 1>oculus rift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's in four.</v>

1115
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:13.460
<v Speaker 1>K is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are what?</v>

1116
00:52:13.461 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Immersive games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not games.</v>

1117
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oculus rift,</v>

1118
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to apply at the games,</v>

1119
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:24.071
<v Speaker 1>but what oculus rift is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a ski goggle thing that you </v>

1120
00:52:24.071 --> 00:52:25.370
<v Speaker 1>put on that is a virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

1121
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:30.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that runs while this is happening and a </v>

1122
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:33.641
<v Speaker 1>lot of what they're doing when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running these just recording these </v>

1123
00:52:33.641 --> 00:52:36.120
<v Speaker 1>incredible scenarios where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1124
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.240
<v Speaker 1>apparently they put cameras all over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's body and they have them go </v>

1125
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.401
<v Speaker 1>through these rooms and then they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the data from all of that and </v>

1126
00:52:46.191 --> 00:52:46.850
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1127
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.360
<v Speaker 1>put it into this program so that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing these goggles,</v>

1128
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you can look around up and down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is data.</v>

1129
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1130
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.880
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is data for every single aspect of</v>

1131
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single area of the room.</v>

1132
00:53:00.871 --> 00:53:05.871
<v Speaker 1>So as you look left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that's been covered and it's all </v>

1133
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:09.251
<v Speaker 1>computing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as computational power and video </v>

1134
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:14.351
<v Speaker 1>cards and all these different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can compute the visual images as </v>

1135
00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:17.621
<v Speaker 1>they improve and get better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten to the point now where it's </v>

1136
00:53:17.621 --> 00:53:20.831
<v Speaker 1>four k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four k is what this television right </v>

1137
00:53:20.831 --> 00:53:20.960
<v Speaker 1>here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the latest,</v>

1138
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 1>greatest version of hd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very high resolution,</v>

1139
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:28.130
<v Speaker 1>beautiful images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my friend Duncan put it on,</v>

1140
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>try it out at one of these developer </v>
<v Speaker 1>conferences and called me just screaming</v>

1141
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and raving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1142
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>this is bigger than the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bigger than the wheel.</v>

1143
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 1>This is the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1144
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.270
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna fucking change everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1145
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.640
<v Speaker 1>he walked into a room in this virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality demonstration and there was a </v>

1146
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.380
<v Speaker 1>man playing the piano piano.</v>

1147
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.580
<v Speaker 1>What does that man playing the piano?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Piano sounded more a more realistic.</v>

1148
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 1>As he got closer to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got louder.</v>

1149
00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could see the man playing it.</v>

1150
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He would step to the side and see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man playing it,</v>

1151
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.040
<v Speaker 1>look over the top of the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the man playing,</v>

1152
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.670
<v Speaker 1>go underneath the piano and see the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

1153
00:54:06.671 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy,</v>

1154
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and it really looks like there's a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you playing the piano,</v>

1155
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but nothing's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that if that technology </v>

1156
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.321
<v Speaker 1>exists today in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is going to come a time whether </v>

1157
00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 1>that time is 100 years from now or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years from now where there will</v>

1158
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:29.541
<v Speaker 1>be an artificial reality that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indecipherable from the reality that we </v>

1159
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:32.610
<v Speaker 1>live in right now from this touch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>

1160
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see reality,</v>

1161
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 1>that we just all accept as real.</v>

1162
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:44.690
<v Speaker 1>That there's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is artificially created but is </v>

1163
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.330
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing and if that is true,</v>

1164
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:52.260
<v Speaker 1>how do we not know that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been in it?</v>

1165
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>How do we not know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we're not talking about </v>

1166
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Voodoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about technology and we're</v>

1167
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 1>talking about pretty trackable stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you follow Moore's law,</v>

1168
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 1>if you follow the any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological laws of extrapolation from</v>

1169
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:12.441
<v Speaker 1>the point that we're at now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point that they're projecting </v>

1170
00:55:12.441 --> 00:55:12.441
<v Speaker 1>just within five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1171
00:55:12.441 --> 00:55:12.441
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

1172
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've seen magic leap,</v>

1173
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:20.181
<v Speaker 1>if you seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say I haven't seen the </v>

1174
00:55:20.181 --> 00:55:22.611
<v Speaker 1>matrix either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like that's sort of the </v>

1175
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:22.611
<v Speaker 1>simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:22.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's similar along those lines.</v>

1177
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Matrix seemed like a total horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just when it came out it seemed like,</v>

1178
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:31.311
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a cool science fiction movie </v>

1179
00:55:31.311 --> 00:55:31.311
<v Speaker 1>about some shit that's not real.</v>

1180
00:55:31.311 --> 00:55:31.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never could be real,</v>

1181
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but now the matrix looks closer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to reality with every passing </v>

1182
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.900
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with every passing year it looks like,</v>

1183
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:44.901
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable whether it's 100 years </v>

1184
00:55:44.901 --> 00:55:47.181
<v Speaker 1>from now or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to give you an </v>

1185
00:55:47.181 --> 00:55:51.021
<v Speaker 1>experience that is indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this experience that we think is </v>

1186
00:55:51.021 --> 00:55:51.021
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1187
00:55:51.021 --> 00:55:55.671
<v Speaker 1>my only sort of jumping point for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's talking about when I was a </v>

1188
00:55:55.671 --> 00:55:58.170
<v Speaker 1>student in computer science and math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took artificial intelligence,</v>

1189
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but now this is going back to not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>date myself,</v>

1190
00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:02.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 1>the twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1985,</v>

1192
00:56:07.321 --> 00:56:12.321
<v Speaker 1>about 1984 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the time one of the things that </v>

1193
00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 1>we had learned in that in this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1194
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 1>So do you know about how now there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers that can easily match,</v>

1195
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grandmasters and chest?</v>

1196
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the time when I was in school,</v>

1197
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.150
<v Speaker 3>some of the early versions of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1198
00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1199
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 3>we're just about at the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grand masters.</v>

1200
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:36.360
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the assignments that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to do in that course was to develop </v>

1201
00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 3>an algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at the chest,</v>

1202
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.980
<v Speaker 3>a decision tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of nodes that it has is </v>

1203
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact moment.</v>

1204
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:45.780
<v Speaker 3>You could probably pull it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1205
00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I tend to the 100 possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it will take you more than the,</v>

1206
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1207
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:56.251
<v Speaker 3>the age of the universe if you want it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to exhaustively search through every </v>

1208
00:56:56.251 --> 00:56:59.821
<v Speaker 3>possible option to rather what you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is use some sort of search </v>

1209
00:56:59.821 --> 00:57:04.291
<v Speaker 3>algorithm to prune out to weed out huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of the decision tree.</v>

1210
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that way,</v>

1211
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:11.850
<v Speaker 3>this huge decision tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only go through the parts that seem </v>

1212
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:11.850
<v Speaker 3>promising.</v>

1213
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.980
<v Speaker 3>And so we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't do it for chest with the </v>

1214
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.961
<v Speaker 3>different other game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at that time I already had founded </v>

1215
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:18.961
<v Speaker 3>almost mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1216
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:23.311
<v Speaker 3>the type of stuff that we were learning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ai to try to sort of model this </v>

1217
00:57:23.311 --> 00:57:27.121
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence that could mimic</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacities of a human grandmaster </v>

1218
00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:28.510
<v Speaker 3>player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you're talking about,</v>

1219
00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many generations ahead of that.</v>

1220
00:57:30.221 --> 00:57:32.150
<v Speaker 3>So incredible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Managing,</v>

1221
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.180
<v Speaker 3>managing generations ahead of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1222
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that long.</v>

1223
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 3>It's really not in terms of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you went by,</v>

1224
00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:45.790
<v Speaker 3>if 30 years went by in the 12 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing will change.</v>

1225
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.080
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1226
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.890
<v Speaker 3>And 30 years today is almost an eternity</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to technology.</v>

1227
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Well actually yesterday we were sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the beach in Laguna,</v>

1228
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.940
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I and the kids and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her and I,</v>

1229
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you have an answer to this.</v>

1230
00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we could pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people today still use non </v>

1231
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 3>smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1232
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1233
00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I joined the fear but so probably you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think like five percent.</v>

1234
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had to guess,</v>

1235
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:15.781
<v Speaker 3>I'd bet it's less than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's about 10 or I bet it's a </v>

1236
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1237
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 3>one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1238
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.160
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say,</v>

1239
00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:26.161
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bet that out of all the people </v>

1240
00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 3>that use cell phones on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1241
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's less than five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's probably around three </v>

1242
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.470
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less than 10 for sure.</v>

1243
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:35.620
<v Speaker 3>What do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1244
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 3>What would you guess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three?</v>

1245
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Like three percent if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see people that are walking </v>

1246
00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think.</v>

1247
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last time I saw,</v>

1248
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the last time that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw somebody sort of flipping a phone.</v>

1249
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I think my mom has one still write text </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1250
00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.790
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still like let her,</v>

1251
00:58:55.810 --> 00:59:00.810
<v Speaker 3>you choose you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have an iphone you use you </v>

1252
00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:03.010
<v Speaker 3>instead of why are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're lazy bitch.</v>

1253
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Just write why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1254
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.090
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1255
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentiment,</v>

1256
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.810
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1257
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.610
<v Speaker 3>not my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom has.</v>

1258
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have a smart phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1259
00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she does.</v>

1260
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what uh,</v>

1261
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>what is the percentage Jamie percentage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that don't use smartphone?</v>

1262
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Just all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can find this.</v>

1263
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.710
<v Speaker 3>There's two thirds of American adults </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a smartphone.</v>

1264
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 3>So I guess it'd be that one third don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if that's a fit.</v>

1265
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean though?</v>

1266
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Was that kind of follows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them may not have any phones.</v>

1267
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're living in 2015,</v>

1268
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.440
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're some fucking barbarian creature.</v>

1269
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got A.</v>

1270
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I've got a good jumping point from </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were talking about </v>

1271
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.881
<v Speaker 3>innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ready for this birth order and </v>

1272
00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:52.241
<v Speaker 3>innovations birth order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your birth order as far as like where </v>

1273
00:59:52.241 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 3>you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1274
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 3>So you ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>

1275
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:59.441
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the background of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story and then I'll tell you about some </v>

1276
00:59:59.441 --> 00:59:59.441
<v Speaker 3>research that we did in a consumer </v>
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

1277
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 3>So there's this gentleman by the name of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frank Salloway.</v>

1278
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 3>He's a historian of science and a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwin supporter.</v>

1279
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.820
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a book in Nineteen Ninety six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly recommended called born to rebel </v>

1280
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.780
<v Speaker 3>where he looked at the 28 most radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific innovations and the history </v>

1281
01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 3>of human thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1282
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.370
<v Speaker 3>The reason for 28,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing magical about number 28.</v>

1283
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 3>There was some criterion by which </v>
<v Speaker 3>something got into that list or not.</v>

1284
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.940
<v Speaker 3>So he looked at the 28th most radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific innovation theory of </v>

1285
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:27.940
<v Speaker 3>evolution would be one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1286
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Something that really changed our </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the world and then he </v>

1287
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:37.301
<v Speaker 3>looked at the birth order through </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical records of either the people </v>

1288
01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:41.630
<v Speaker 3>who espouse the theory or those who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>the staunchest,</v>

1289
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 3>the tractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents to the theory.</v>

1290
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 3>And what he found is that the later </v>
<v Speaker 3>borns,</v>

1291
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:54.430
<v Speaker 3>we're much more likely to be the ones to</v>
<v Speaker 3>espouse the radical scientific </v>

1292
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.430
<v Speaker 3>innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1293
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll explain in a second why,</v>

1294
01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he argued basically that when a child</v>

1295
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:04.241
<v Speaker 3>is born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first sort of adaptive problem that </v>

1296
01:01:04.241 --> 01:01:07.800
<v Speaker 3>he has to solve is how to maximize </v>
<v Speaker 3>parental investment to,</v>

1297
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.380
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1298
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:13.470
<v Speaker 3>to himself or herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way you do that is by occupying </v>

1299
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.560
<v Speaker 3>a unique niche in the eyes of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

1300
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 3>So if your firstborn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1301
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>there are no other niches that have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>occupied.</v>

1302
01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:25.451
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in each would be I want to be a good </v>

1303
01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:25.451
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

1304
01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:25.451
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a rebel would be another </v>
<v Speaker 3>niche,</v>

1305
01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:30.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that he called this Darwinian </v>

1306
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.220
<v Speaker 3>partitioning niche hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1307
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.220
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1308
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a positioning proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1309
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:35.900
<v Speaker 3>How do I position myself to be maximally</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from all the other children?</v>

1310
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.490
<v Speaker 3>So the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first,</v>

1311
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born has nobody,</v>

1312
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>all the niches are available as you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the cip ship,</v>

1313
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 3>there are fewer and fewer niches that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are available.</v>

1314
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:51.370
<v Speaker 3>This forces later barns to be more out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the box thinkers to be more </v>

1315
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be less rigid,</v>

1316
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 3>to be less conforming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1317
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.200
<v Speaker 3>and the data was actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>astonishing.</v>

1318
01:01:57.201 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 3>So for 23 out of the 28th radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific innovations,</v>

1319
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what he found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incidentally.</v>

1320
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to guess what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Godfather's birth orders last?</v>

1321
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fourth of four.</v>

1322
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 3>That's why I always said expect great </v>
<v Speaker 3>things from the Godfather.</v>

1323
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 3>It's meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1324
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1325
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:18.290
<v Speaker 3>so we took this idea and we applied it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1326
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>since we were talking about adoption</v>

1327
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>of phones and cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart phones,</v>

1328
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>we applied it to the context of are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>a product innovator?</v>

1329
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Jus adopt something early or late and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1330
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>And we exactly replicated celebrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>findings.</v>

1331
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Firstborns were much more conforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

1332
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Bourns were much more innovative in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>product context.</v>

1333
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:43.191
<v Speaker 1>So we took the idea of way and applied </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a consumer context that actually </v>

1334
01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:47.481
<v Speaker 1>makes a ton of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I think could possibly be </v>

1335
01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a consideration is that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger you get fucked with by your </v>

1336
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>older brothers and sisters because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1337
01:02:55.171 --> 01:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>because they're tired of taking shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the parents and you're forced to </v>

1338
01:03:00.171 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 1>think outside the box because you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work around.</v>

1339
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Those fuckers are constantly trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess your game up.</v>

1340
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>At every point in turn they cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make up rules.</v>

1341
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They tell you what mom said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well mom didn't really say anything yet.</v>

1342
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.400
<v Speaker 1>You get in trouble the last born now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first hot.</v>

1343
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know devious.</v>

1344
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:20.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to have all these </v>

1345
01:03:20.751 --> 01:03:20.751
<v Speaker 1>statues as the firstborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>

1346
01:03:20.751 --> 01:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only in only in the conforming sense.</v>

1347
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.340
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could argue that maybe within your </v>

1348
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:28.340
<v Speaker 1>social media this is conforming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1349
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1350
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Or you just liked tattoos or he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked that it was.</v>

1351
01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And you're not scared of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1352
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1353
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fascinating when you look </v>

1354
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>at what causes someone to be innovative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what causes someone mean.</v>

1355
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I've thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>of as a parent and um,</v>

1356
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 1>many my friends have the same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all my interesting friends came </v>

1357
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.831
<v Speaker 1>from fucked up childhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my interesting friends had parents </v>

1358
01:03:57.831 --> 01:04:01.131
<v Speaker 1>that were a mess and they all childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>was chaos and it forced them to develop </v>

1359
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>a unique character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1360
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying my best to make my </v>

1361
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 1>children's lives as easy and comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

1362
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.890
<v Speaker 1>But in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I hampering them right hampering </v>

1363
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>their development and some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiteboard or around them,</v>

1364
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.770
<v Speaker 1>around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smack on every now and then just to keep</v>

1365
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push them my way.</v>

1366
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just I think that there's other ways,</v>

1367
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:30.351
<v Speaker 1>and this is my theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways to encourage </v>

1368
01:04:30.351 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>innovation or creativity or to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>your passions and dreams.</v>

1369
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I'm also </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite shocked at,</v>

1370
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with having children is how absolutely,</v>

1371
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 1>absolutely unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are right out of the box in a happy</v>

1372
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>environment with no stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no financial issues.</v>

1373
01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no arguing and screaming from </v>

1374
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:57.231
<v Speaker 1>the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is it about kids had to those </v>

1375
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.320
<v Speaker 1>right out of the vagina are just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different person,</v>

1376
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>like from day one made from each other.</v>

1377
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So different.</v>

1378
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That speaks to the fact that there are </v>

1379
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.750
<v Speaker 1>an innate elements to our personhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1380
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Or astrology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Astrology,</v>

1381
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1382
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it may be.</v>

1383
01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You need to just come over to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystical side a a little bit,</v>

1384
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon to do that.</v>

1385
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever talked to someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>read those?</v>

1386
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.770
<v Speaker 1>My wild fennel aunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1387
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already forgot what we spoke about?</v>

1388
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can she read those charts?</v>

1389
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could read the.</v>

1390
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1391
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>the coffee stains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1392
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>but that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's talks about astrological stuff.</v>

1393
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those people that can read </v>

1394
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.351
<v Speaker 1>those things were mercury's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrograde and they know we're Pluto is </v>

1395
01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:47.311
<v Speaker 1>the time your dad came and your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can figure that stuff out on </v>

1396
01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>hung around in those circles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unfortunately not enough.</v>

1397
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there are people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely consumed by the Uber Complex </v>

1398
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 1>aspects of astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real astrology now,</v>

1399
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:02.530
<v Speaker 1>like the stuff that you get in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday paper,</v>

1400
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Leo,</v>

1401
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 1>so today's a good day to take a shit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it would be.</v>

1402
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those really random,</v>

1403
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>but apparently there's just volumes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books written on constellations and the </v>

1404
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:20.641
<v Speaker 1>alignment of these constellations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the stars are at any particular </v>

1405
01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 1>time and it's dependent upon what time </v>
<v Speaker 1>of year,</v>

1406
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 1>what time of day do you buy into that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any way,</v>

1407
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:32.611
<v Speaker 1>shape or form?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are a lot of people that </v>

1408
01:06:32.611 --> 01:06:34.501
<v Speaker 1>believe that Leo's have a very distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and have distinct </v>

1409
01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>personality traits that are trackable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about Leo's.</v>

1410
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm libra telling me about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1411
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>but I'm Aaliyah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand the good </v>

1412
01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very charismatic.</v>

1413
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Very brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you?</v>

1414
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I know I hired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the outlier.</v>

1415
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm the black sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1416
01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Black sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's triggering tracy.</v>

1417
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1418
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Then you said trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even more of a trigger,</v>

1419
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1420
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm so triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what to do.</v>

1421
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up with you about that trigger </v>

1422
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.590
<v Speaker 1>ship because it was something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were helping about.</v>

1423
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>You sent me and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1424
01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.980
<v Speaker 1>we tweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1425
01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about.</v>

1426
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I was so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman who was a professor or Kipnis.</v>

1427
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explained the story because I'm.</v>

1428
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the idea is that there's </v>

1429
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>all these movements about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1430
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.790
<v Speaker 1>how horrifyingly violent campuses are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of sexual violence,</v>

1431
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>which is of course not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had written an article where she</v>

1432
01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>was criticizing that position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the lunacy,</v>

1433
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.630
<v Speaker 1>the hysteria involved with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

1434
01:07:37.631 --> 01:07:42.631
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One out of every five women will be </v>

1435
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:42.631
<v Speaker 1>raped on canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is complete nonsense,</v>

1436
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1437
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the actual numbers?</v>

1438
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't studied it carefully,</v>

1439
01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that was true.</v>

1440
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it depends how you defined.</v>

1441
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you look at them exactly </v>

1442
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1443
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so exactly the male,</v>

1444
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>because the male gaze is a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual rape.</v>

1445
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1446
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>that's why I've written an article about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1447
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You should check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1448
01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>the bikini is patriarchal oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Burka is liberating.</v>

1449
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.150
<v Speaker 1>This is western feminists who argue this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they argue this because.</v>

1450
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly using the argument of the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze,</v>

1451
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>since the Burka liberates women from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>male gaze and the bikini draws the male </v>

1452
01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bikini is bad.</v>

1453
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>The burke as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the grape smuggler?</v>

1454
01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the grid smarter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where men were a little,</v>

1455
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:33.870
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little John Claude van Damme </v>

1456
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that people were like in France </v>

1457
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1458
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bikini that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reference went over my head.</v>

1459
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean like this?</v>

1460
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The little speedos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Speedos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1462
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't respond to the visual </v>

1463
01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>stimuli the way that men do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where?</v>

1464
01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that.</v>

1465
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1466
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when girls see channing tatum doing that</v>

1467
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Magic Mike Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing around on stage,</v>

1468
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:56.090
<v Speaker 1>you tell me the not responding to visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimuli.</v>

1469
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a bunch of convenient bullshit by</v>

1470
01:08:59.751 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 1>guys who have shitty bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to think their girlfriends</v>

1471
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:07.901
<v Speaker 1>drooling a channing tatum with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>little fucking daisy dukes on or </v>

1472
01:09:07.901 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing his construction,</v>

1473
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>so you actually think that is in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women are indistinguishable in </v>

1474
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.520
<v Speaker 1>the manner by which they respond to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't say that.</v>

1475
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they absolutely respond visually.</v>

1476
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why men want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>six packs wise because girls get excited</v>

1477
01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 1>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

1478
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think it's the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem.</v>

1479
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I think there's there's pursuit stimuli </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a guy will see a girl who's got a </v>

1480
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.190
<v Speaker 1>hot bag into bikini and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

1481
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.190
<v Speaker 1>and they literally go running up to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to talk to them.</v>

1482
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:42.191
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that same thing happens </v>

1483
01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 1>with females to males as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea,</v>

1484
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's also just gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles,</v>

1485
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 1>has deal with testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to deal with many,</v>

1486
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture,</v>

1487
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 1>the normal behavior as far as male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female behavior.</v>

1488
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I think both sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they look at each other,</v>

1489
01:09:58.171 --> 01:10:03.171
<v Speaker 1>are looking for a important cues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are relevant to the American market.</v>

1490
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So you're absolutely right that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking,</v>

1491
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:10.451
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like tight buttocks because that </v>

1492
01:10:10.451 --> 01:10:13.210
<v Speaker 1>sends an important signal for size and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape of the sperm point nine waist to </v>

1493
01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:15.920
<v Speaker 1>hip ratio on a mass of the swimmers.</v>

1494
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 1>The male swimmers build is very have </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide shoulders,</v>

1495
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160
<v Speaker 1>thin waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1496
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:23.810
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not suggesting that women don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to visual cues,</v>

1497
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly don't respond nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as men.</v>

1498
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I think they respond probably in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>

1499
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within equal intensity but not act in an</v>

1500
01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:37.250
<v Speaker 1>equal intensity and certainly not act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a threatening way.</v>

1501
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the male gaze comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why aren't there a million a male </v>

1502
01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>stripper shops targeting heterosexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

1503
01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You should get into that market like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>

1504
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of male strip shows and </v>

1505
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>in fact in vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the things that they advertise</v>

1506
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:57.641
<v Speaker 1>the airport when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thunder down under and all this </v>

1507
01:10:57.641 --> 01:11:00.521
<v Speaker 1>jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of guys with their shirts off </v>

1508
01:11:00.521 --> 01:11:02.500
<v Speaker 1>sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women don't feel comfortable going </v>

1509
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>into those environments the way men feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.</v>

1510
01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:07.751
<v Speaker 1>So they go in these packs of wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen creatures and they scream and </v>

1511
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:16.331
<v Speaker 1>yell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a bit about it that it's </v>

1512
01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:16.331
<v Speaker 1>a totally that ladies'</v>

1513
01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:19.010
<v Speaker 2>night out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different kind of </v>

1514
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 2>experience when they go leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they scream and cheer and yell.</v>

1515
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Where guys sit there and don't say much </v>
<v Speaker 2>of anything.</v>

1516
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 2>He just kind of stare like that speaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory.</v>

1517
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a difference.</v>

1518
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 2>It's sisterhood of the pants or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1519
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 2>That right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're banding together,</v>

1520
01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that women don't have the </v>

1521
01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.711
<v Speaker 2>correct outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why when a book like 50 shades </v>

1522
01:11:39.711 --> 01:11:40.110
<v Speaker 2>of grey comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all go fucking bananas.</v>

1523
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Like finally we've got a channel to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>funnel.</v>

1524
01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:46.570
<v Speaker 2>All of our sex urge is through right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1525
01:11:46.571 --> 01:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>You see them read their reading porn on </v>
<v Speaker 2>planes.</v>

1526
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>You're passing by on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're reading gag porn.</v>

1527
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1528
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 2>if you want to understand male versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>female sexuality,</v>

1529
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but please,</v>

1530
01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to understand male sexuality</v>

1531
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 2>than you do a content analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>

1532
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 2>If you want to understand female </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>

1533
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 2>you do a content analysis of romance </v>
<v Speaker 2>novels.</v>

1534
01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1535
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the archetype of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to speak to your six </v>

1536
01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.190
<v Speaker 2>back about the pretty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1537
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.030
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the archetype of the male</v>
<v Speaker 2>hero in romance novels,</v>

1538
01:12:18.031 --> 01:12:20.610
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of which culture the </v>
<v Speaker 2>romance novel is written,</v>

1539
01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:24.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be Romania or Egypt or</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Newport beach,</v>

1540
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 2>he's always the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a tall guy.</v>

1541
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 2>He's got a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's account meaning,</v>

1542
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also a neurosurgeon.</v>

1543
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>He wrestles alligators on his six back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's reckless.</v>

1544
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.910
<v Speaker 2>He's risky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only to be tamed by the love of that</v>

1545
01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:39.900
<v Speaker 2>one woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1546
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>So I've already told you about the every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single archetype that you've,</v>

1547
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean the same archetype and every </v>
<v Speaker 2>romance novel.</v>

1548
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:51.500
<v Speaker 2>The reason why the archetype is there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it exactly caters to women's </v>

1549
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:51.690
<v Speaker 2>fantasies.</v>

1550
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.960
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes he's like half a chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got long hair and like very </v>

1551
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 2>chique like behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wears,</v>

1552
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:05.241
<v Speaker 2>like flowing very sheer shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which no guy in their right mind would </v>

1553
01:13:05.241 --> 01:13:10.001
<v Speaker 2>ever wear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you did where women would mock </v>

1554
01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:10.001
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1555
01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:10.001
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were,</v>

1556
01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:12.430
<v Speaker 2>if you have long flowing fabio hair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had like a,</v>

1557
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:17.431
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a blouse on and you went out to a </v>

1558
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:17.431
<v Speaker 2>nightclub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go with a fuck is wrong with that</v>

1559
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a romance novel,</v>

1560
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you're on the cover baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1561
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 2>because you have to also send out some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cues of sensitivity,</v>

1562
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:24.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what that is?</v>

1563
01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 2>It's an artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit sensitive.</v>

1564
01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So guess it's just not a real person,</v>

1565
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:34.010
<v Speaker 2>just like the vampires when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why women fell in love with those</v>

1566
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.300
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

1567
01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:41.301
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vampires that don't even burn up in the </v>

1568
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:44.001
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sparkle like what was all that </v>

1569
01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:44.001
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1570
01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:44.001
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those narratives on dairy,</v>

1571
01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you twilight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

1572
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1573
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>New.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too busy watching Lionel Messi a </v>

1574
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1575
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1576
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:54.940
<v Speaker 2>those books sold fucking millions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vampire ones.</v>

1577
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions and millions of copies.</v>

1578
01:13:56.971 --> 01:14:01.971
<v Speaker 2>And they were essentially a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>romance porn vampire bullshit for </v>

1579
01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 2>chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1580
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 2>these men in these books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these vampires,</v>

1581
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 2>they didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only did they not exist,</v>

1582
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>they didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the main</v>

1583
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one that uh,</v>

1584
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Christian,</v>

1585
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell her name was and ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck his name is rob,</v>

1586
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of those that carry </v>

1587
01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.231
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was supposed to bleed like 90 </v>

1588
01:14:25.231 --> 01:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>years old or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

1589
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>he got like in the Spanish plague is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he died and that's when it became a</v>

1590
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:35.581
<v Speaker 1>vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has to still go to high school </v>

1591
01:14:35.581 --> 01:14:35.581
<v Speaker 1>because when it became a vampire he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 17,</v>

1592
01:14:35.581 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>so he has to show up and go to high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school with all normal people.</v>

1593
01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.860
<v Speaker 1>But he goes to high school in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific northwest because it's never </v>

1594
01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:43.860
<v Speaker 1>sunny out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't glitter.</v>

1595
01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the dumbest fucking books of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

1596
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get watch that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1597
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know a lot about a lot about it.</v>

1598
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I've watched little moments of it before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I panicked and shut it off.</v>

1599
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did watch one of them,</v>

1600
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I think I watched the second one anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point being watched.</v>

1601
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>The one with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They became Werewolf's.</v>

1602
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made me mad.</v>

1603
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:08.160
<v Speaker 1>But point being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is 90 fucking years old and </v>

1604
01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.670
<v Speaker 1>he's hanging around with 17 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's an asshole,</v>

1605
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pretending to be 17.</v>

1606
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 1>He falls in love with the 17 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>navy and had sex with her eventually,</v>

1607
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.670
<v Speaker 1>which is pedophilia and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really pedal.</v>

1608
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Not just pedophilia but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1609
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:25.681
<v Speaker 1>What do you have in common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been around for 90 years and </v>

1610
01:15:25.681 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 1>you've got something in common with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl who's 17 years old.</v>

1611
01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:32.090
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more than 90 years really because in </v>

1612
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.410
<v Speaker 1>the 19 twenties or whatever the hell it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1613
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>we're assuming that he was 17 years old </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1614
01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 1>so he's more than 100 years old.</v>

1615
01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dumbest fucking book of all </v>

1616
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was huge.</v>

1617
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Women loved it and it didn't represent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real person and he represented the exact</v>

1618
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 1>opposite of a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what guys like actually exists,</v>

1619
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 1>guys like sluts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1620
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And those are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1621
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.780
<v Speaker 1>when I say slots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all due respect.</v>

1622
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not slut shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way another trigger.</v>

1623
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't slut.</v>

1624
01:15:59.141 --> 01:16:04.141
<v Speaker 1>Shame is because then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mocking girls for their ability </v>

1625
01:16:04.141 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 1>to choose their sexual partners as part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the patriarchy.</v>

1626
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is,</v>

1627
01:16:06.221 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1628
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm strongly against the patriarchy.</v>

1629
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to get in trouble for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and the way he's not at all.</v>

1630
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Last time you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one said anything and I mean some </v>

1631
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:21.781
<v Speaker 1>trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they usually it was a Jew that you </v>

1632
01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Ju Ju got mad at you for being </v>

1633
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Jewish.</v>

1634
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Julie's as Zionists shields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>June.</v>

1635
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's usually the extent of the </v>

1636
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:31.320
<v Speaker 1>negative stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a damn sign.</v>

1637
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.441
<v Speaker 1>The shills yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to your friend Laura </v>

1638
01:16:35.441 --> 01:16:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Kipnis did say her name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiss Kiss,</v>

1639
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Kiss Laura Kipnis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is a professor at northwestern </v>

1640
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.000
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she wrote this essay,</v>

1641
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.540
<v Speaker 1>a chronicle of higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the article in the Atlantic it </v>

1642
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 1>brings it up describing a new campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of sexual paranoia.</v>

1643
01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And she was then subject to a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation after students who were </v>

1644
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:57.330
<v Speaker 1>offended by the articles and by a tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she sent file filed a chapter nine </v>

1645
01:16:58.271 --> 01:17:00.100
<v Speaker 1>complaint against her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>

1646
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1647
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women should have equal access to </v>

1648
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:06.480
<v Speaker 1>education and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in a safe,</v>

1649
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was somehow suppressing.</v>

1650
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Well because by her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by</v>

1651
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.140
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1652
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:16.390
<v Speaker 3>making light of the endemic sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence on campus and quotes,</v>

1653
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.500
<v Speaker 3>she was condoning it and therefore she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was making all these women feel unsafe </v>

1654
01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:28.070
<v Speaker 3>and unwelcomed and threatened on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so two students,</v>

1655
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started that process.</v>

1656
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know the details.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not a constitutional lawyer,</v>

1657
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 3>but basically once sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the complaint is filed,</v>

1658
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:41.770
<v Speaker 3>then sort of the train starts and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes this orwellian thing that that's</v>

1659
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

1660
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a complete nightmare.</v>

1661
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.840
<v Speaker 3>And so I read that stuff and I just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>so angry and I spent pretty much that </v>

1662
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.730
<v Speaker 3>whole day rallying up the forces in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind enough to treat it and just,</v>

1663
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tweet got me something like 100,000</v>

1664
01:17:55.161 --> 01:17:56.220
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1665
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.570
<v Speaker 3>and then I communicated with her because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to send her a signal that,</v>

1666
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some of us that still have to </v>

1667
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>stickler fortitude that are willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1668
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.500
<v Speaker 3>in academia you shouldn't even say</v>

1669
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>gesticulate trigger that it's for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why counterparts compatriot.</v>

1670
01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1671
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1672
01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to,</v>

1673
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 1>to tell her that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1674
01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.120
<v Speaker 1>some of us were supporting her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:18:19.121 --> 01:18:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I read it and I thought it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>

1676
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it just seems so common.</v>

1677
01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:30.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the most disturbing aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was not some unusual occurrence </v>

1678
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.660
<v Speaker 1>where kids are freaking out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and overreacting.</v>

1679
01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Where you could look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1680
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1681
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.340
<v Speaker 1>this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1682
01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's what bugs me the most about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1683
01:18:37.901 --> 01:18:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1684
01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea that looking at data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the realities of the climate </v>

1685
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:48.700
<v Speaker 1>of free speech on these campuses and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's oppressed and it's not free speech,</v>

1686
01:18:48.701 --> 01:18:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you are free to think as they do know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't think as they do,</v>

1687
01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not free.</v>

1688
01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.900
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1689
01:18:56.050 --> 01:19:00.100
<v Speaker 3>this issue of how cowardly most </v>
<v Speaker 3>academics have become.</v>

1690
01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:00.940
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say this,</v>

1691
01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:03.190
<v Speaker 3>realizing that I'm going to piss off </v>
<v Speaker 3>many of my colleagues.</v>

1692
01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm astonished how academics who are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the business of engaging in public </v>

1693
01:19:09.281 --> 01:19:13.810
<v Speaker 3>discourse are so tepid because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been silenced and to fear.</v>

1694
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it in many,</v>

1695
01:19:14.861 --> 01:19:19.861
<v Speaker 3>many different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just share one example which I </v>

1696
01:19:19.861 --> 01:19:21.150
<v Speaker 3>think I shared in another show recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I put up a,</v>

1697
01:19:21.151 --> 01:19:23.230
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clip on facebook,</v>

1698
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:27.340
<v Speaker 3>have a Iraqi astronomer who was arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1699
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Koran it says that the earth is </v>

1700
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>flat and it's clear that the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

1701
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I shared that clip to demonstrate </v>

1702
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:37.320
<v Speaker 3>sort of the lunacy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1703
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious dogma I can have on an </v>

1704
01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.230
<v Speaker 3>otherwise supposedly intelligent person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Iraqi astronomer now,</v>

1705
01:19:44.231 --> 01:19:48.460
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the reaction was of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia?</v>

1706
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Zionist asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's allowed to have those thoughts.</v>

1707
01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.600
<v Speaker 3>He's part of a suppressed culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1708
01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:57.250
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't have the courage to tackle me</v>

1709
01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:02.251
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she wrote on my publicly not </v>

1710
01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:02.251
<v Speaker 3>privately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1711
01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:06.301
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't academic white woman from </v>
<v Speaker 3>California who's written with guilt and </v>

1712
01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>hate her in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wrote to me saying,</v>

1713
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that,</v>

1714
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad of you to be sharing this,</v>

1715
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 3>don't you think it's bad that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of stigmatizing them?</v>

1716
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.520
<v Speaker 3>So step for a second and think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what this means,</v>

1717
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This scientist,</v>

1718
01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:23.871
<v Speaker 3>colleague of mine was not offended that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fellow scientists would actually hold </v>

1719
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 3>such a astonishingly false position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1720
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:30.450
<v Speaker 3>He's a member of the flat Earth Society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather,</v>

1721
01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:33.630
<v Speaker 3>she was offended that I would point to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his lunacy.</v>

1722
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.960
<v Speaker 3>So that I think that small anecdote </v>
<v Speaker 3>really captures the culture of fear that</v>

1723
01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you see on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in a sense,</v>

1724
01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 3>if I can sort of toot my own horn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1725
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:49.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm really a very rare breed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the guy who walks around not </v>

1726
01:20:49.101 --> 01:20:52.200
<v Speaker 3>caring a saying it as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's my personality.</v>

1727
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't be anything else,</v>

1728
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but you also are a very open minded guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when it comes down to like the </v>

1729
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:04.431
<v Speaker 1>core values of these people promote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is a lack of racial </v>

1730
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:10.311
<v Speaker 1>insensitivity or racial stereotyping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender issues,</v>

1731
01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 1>whether it's sexism or homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1732
01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you're on the liberal side of all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1733
01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:20.310
<v Speaker 1>But so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're essentially a liberal,</v>

1734
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1735
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:26.290
<v Speaker 3>If I can say I'm a true liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the liberals that exist today </v>

1736
01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:29.150
<v Speaker 3>because the liberals have today as our </v>
<v Speaker 3>common friend,</v>

1737
01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali have </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1738
01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.200
<v Speaker 3>have a huge blind spot when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain issues where they fall really on</v>

1739
01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:41.201
<v Speaker 3>the wrong side of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a true liberal is one who doesn't </v>

1740
01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:44.711
<v Speaker 3>Miss Ward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't fall prey to cultural and </v>

1741
01:21:44.711 --> 01:21:44.711
<v Speaker 3>moral relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't say,</v>

1742
01:21:44.711 --> 01:21:49.541
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are we to judge the cutting off of </v>

1743
01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:49.541
<v Speaker 3>Clarissa's of women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their culture,</v>

1744
01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:50.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a true liberal,</v>

1745
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.790
<v Speaker 1>so not a true liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

1746
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.080
<v Speaker 1>they're fake liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1747
01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribing to the current trend of,</v>

1748
01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>of discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1749
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And the current trend of discourse is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything Islamic,</v>

1750
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:04.880
<v Speaker 1>leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1751
01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that's being a pussy.</v>

1752
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1753
01:22:08.361 --> 01:22:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that is cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of backlash.</v>

1754
01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:15.911
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of a label.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia is a very strange label </v>

1755
01:22:15.911 --> 01:22:19.580
<v Speaker 1>because there's no Christian have phobia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even antisemetic,</v>

1756
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1757
01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of antisemetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a logic and thinking that is promoted in</v>

1758
01:22:28.581 --> 01:22:31.280
<v Speaker 1>certain Islamic cultures that's ignored </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

1759
01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with that in certain </v>

1760
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1761
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.461
<v Speaker 1>did you see that video of the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was walking through Paris dressed in a </v>

1762
01:22:39.461 --> 01:22:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Jewish way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1763
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that fucking disturbing?</v>

1764
01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:42.490
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1765
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:44.390
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1766
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just showing how openly in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the most sickening way openly anti </v>

1767
01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people are in,</v>

1768
01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.250
<v Speaker 1>in Paris,</v>

1769
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.280
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should make it clear.</v>

1770
01:23:00.281 --> 01:23:02.140
<v Speaker 3>And of course now there'll be the hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

1771
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not anti Israel,</v>

1772
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:05.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1773
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anti Jewish.</v>

1774
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It's antisemitic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

1775
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the term symmetric because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some medic is like some many people.</v>

1776
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's represents a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't Jewish.</v>

1777
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's anti Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1778
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the term is understood,</v>

1779
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.210
<v Speaker 1>typically symmetric means it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous,</v>

1780
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 1>but your point is well taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is his antisemitic?</v>

1781
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a lot of Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures that aren't Jewish.</v>

1782
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the sort of the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical context for why that tool </v>

1783
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>when you want to appear to be smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say antisemetic,</v>

1784
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't say anti Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1785
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It sounds a bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More educated,</v>

1786
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 1>more educated since confirmed dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go with anti Jewish.</v>

1787
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the route.</v>

1788
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a dummy and a good comic,</v>

1789
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 1>which you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as I think we might've discussed</v>

1790
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:51.190
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe we didn't,</v>

1791
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 1>there was a correlation between being </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny and being highly intelligent.</v>

1792
01:23:56.170 --> 01:24:01.170
<v Speaker 1>But whether you probably have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a type of intelligence like </v>

1793
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 1>mathematically on basically retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>

1794
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 1>but you probably have good social </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1795
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:08.791
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm able to come up with those </v>

1796
01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:08.791
<v Speaker 1>anecdotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1797
01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You actually have acuity to see patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of social interactions.</v>

1798
01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will be much for Pat,</v>

1799
01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:19.651
<v Speaker 1>myself on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll let you do that real quick and </v>

1800
01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:19.651
<v Speaker 1>then we'll move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1801
01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm overwhelmed by your charisma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1802
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But getting back to this video,</v>

1803
01:24:24.821 --> 01:24:29.821
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see anyone freaking out over </v>

1804
01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anything that may be a Sam Harris,</v>

1805
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:36.691
<v Speaker 1>our friend would say over overblown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown out of proportion to the extreme </v>

1806
01:24:36.731 --> 01:24:41.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's a target because that label</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia is so.</v>

1807
01:24:41.261 --> 01:24:46.261
<v Speaker 1>He's like when Ben Affleck that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb ass when he went after him on the </v>

1808
01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:48.310
<v Speaker 1>bill Maher show and just like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1809
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it was such an obvious ploy to like fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that idea.</v>

1810
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.870
<v Speaker 1>The eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a well thought out,</v>

1811
01:24:55.871 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 1>well examined point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1812
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying.</v>

1813
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:03.430
<v Speaker 1>So racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's arrogant and his ignorance.</v>

1814
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrogant in the fact that he felt like </v>

1815
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.520
<v Speaker 1>this was an easy thing to pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

1816
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And he'd get the applause from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1817
01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 1>He was searching for Social Brownie </v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

1818
01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>surfing Social Brownie points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to the,</v>

1819
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.570
<v Speaker 1>to the anti Jewish stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1820
01:25:19.571 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1821
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:23.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean an atheist,</v>

1822
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough accent by the way,</v>

1823
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.850
<v Speaker 1>for anybody who's going to write and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1824
01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:29.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could he be Jewish and atheist?</v>

1825
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:34.650
<v Speaker 1>You can be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most famous Jews were all </v>

1826
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 1>atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism is more than just adherence to a</v>

1827
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>set of religious narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1828
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a cultural element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a historical element.</v>

1829
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:46.681
<v Speaker 1>There are all sorts of fastest to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish that don't necessarily mean you </v>

1830
01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:46.681
<v Speaker 1>have to believe in Booga Booga stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1831
01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Booga Booga not going to get hate mail </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the rabbis hate from the Buddha.</v>

1832
01:25:51.991 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Buddha too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1833
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I grew up in Lebanon,</v>

1834
01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you might say,</v>

1835
01:25:56.081 --> 01:25:58.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Lebanon was such a progressive,</v>

1836
01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:03.120
<v Speaker 1>tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful place where everybody got </v>

1837
01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that I used to date a </v>

1838
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 1>Lebanese girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did say she told me it's</v>

1839
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:06.230
<v Speaker 3>fucking craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it that she was.</v>

1840
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she grew up in America,</v>

1841
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 3>but her family was from Lebanon and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1842
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:10.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1843
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:15.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the typical sort of narrative that you </v>

1844
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:17.561
<v Speaker 3>hear is that Lebanon was of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries in the Middle East was the </v>

1845
01:26:17.561 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 3>most progressive one and have to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent that was true.</v>

1846
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.840
<v Speaker 3>But what they don't understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive in the context of the Middle</v>

1847
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>East is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than progressive in the </v>

1848
01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1849
01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.380
<v Speaker 3>So if you were Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were quilt tolerated.</v>

1850
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.040
<v Speaker 3>That means that will tolerate you until </v>
<v Speaker 3>we no longer tolerate you.</v>

1851
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we left Lebanon because we </v>

1852
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:39.100
<v Speaker 3>were going to be executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1853
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1854
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up sort of with a dark secret.</v>

1855
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1856
01:26:41.961 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't wear a star of David.</v>

1857
01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Now if people wanted to find out if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were Jewish,</v>

1858
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 3>they could easily do that.</v>

1859
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:51.370
<v Speaker 3>They could go to synagogue on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not as though it was </v>

1860
01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:52.610
<v Speaker 3>absolutely hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you certainly,</v>

1861
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know your place amongst the greater </v>

1862
01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:58.760
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a minority and we tolerate you.</v>

1863
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 3>You live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

1864
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 3>if I don't know if you know the term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know the term?</v>

1865
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 3>They may know them as a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third class citizen as enshrined in the </v>

1866
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Islamic texts for people at the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning Christians and Jews.</v>

1867
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Meaning monotheists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1868
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Pagans,</v>

1869
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:18.020
<v Speaker 3>not the polytheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Hindus,</v>

1870
01:27:18.021 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Buddhist,</v>

1871
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:24.580
<v Speaker 3>not the atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jews and Christians under Islamic </v>

1872
01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 3>law could be afforded protection as long</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they paid the right.</v>

1873
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:32.621
<v Speaker 3>That means they pay sort of a poll tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be protected by their Muslim </v>

1874
01:27:32.621 --> 01:27:32.621
<v Speaker 3>overlords.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1875
01:27:32.621 --> 01:27:34.810
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called to live as a Dhimmi.</v>

1876
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Lebanon,</v>

1877
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:39.290
<v Speaker 3>you didn't officially have to pay that </v>
<v Speaker 3>poll tax,</v>

1878
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.050
<v Speaker 3>but what you did is you knew your place.</v>

1879
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother David,</v>

1880
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.880
<v Speaker 3>who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would like this because you're a </v>

1881
01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:48.880
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy mma guy.</v>

1882
01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 3>He used to be in the Olympics and judo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Nike 76.</v>

1883
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1884
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:57.161
<v Speaker 3>in the early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had won several Lebanese </v>

1885
01:27:57.161 --> 01:28:00.071
<v Speaker 3>championships and then one day he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>visited by some guys who told him that,</v>

1886
01:28:00.351 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jew,</v>

1887
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:03.560
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time to sort of stop winning.</v>

1888
01:28:03.561 --> 01:28:07.280
<v Speaker 3>So it's time to retire or else you end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up at the bottom of a river.</v>

1889
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Then he left to pursue his career in </v>
<v Speaker 3>judo and France.</v>

1890
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:13.390
<v Speaker 3>This was before the civil war stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1891
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>

1892
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:15.710
<v Speaker 3>when we escaped Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1893
01:28:15.711 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 3>literally we're escaping execution when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

1894
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:24.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the first time that anybody </v>

1895
01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:24.190
<v Speaker 3>hears this particular story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

1896
01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 3>that's your birthday gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1897
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we,</v>

1898
01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:31.180
<v Speaker 3>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the captain said that we were out of </v>

1899
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Lebanese airspace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is when we're leaving Lebanon to,</v>

1900
01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.480
<v Speaker 3>to immigrate to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1901
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.050
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're out of Lebanese.</v>

1902
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 3>My mother takes out a star of David,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts it around my neck and says,</v>

1903
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 3>now you don't have to hide who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is in progressive Lebanon,</v>

1904
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:46.700
<v Speaker 3>pluralistic Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>

1905
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:51.790
<v Speaker 3>now watch what's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to receive comments of </v>

1906
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:54.491
<v Speaker 3>people saying what a hate monger he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just trying to make those other </v>

1907
01:28:54.711 --> 01:28:59.711
<v Speaker 3>folks look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my whole personal history as somehow </v>

1908
01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 3>negated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm either making it up or</v>

1909
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.140
<v Speaker 1>why am I talking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you making.</v>

1910
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm the hateful guy for mentioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I escaped execution of others.</v>

1911
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should pay those </v>

1912
01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.531
<v Speaker 1>people any minds for certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>address them when they're not even </v>

1913
01:29:15.531 --> 01:29:18.051
<v Speaker 1>communicating with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like sort of artificially bringing </v>

1914
01:29:18.051 --> 01:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>up their voices and then responding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their voices.</v>

1915
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for that godfather move </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1916
01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

1917
01:29:23.241 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1918
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:28.990
<v Speaker 1>it disturbed me that this video wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video of this guy walking through </v>

1919
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He,</v>

1920
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.230
<v Speaker 1>he was a Jewish gentleman who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed as,</v>

1921
01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>he was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1922
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:42.831
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like that girl that walked </v>

1923
01:29:42.831 --> 01:29:42.831
<v Speaker 1>through Manhattan and got all the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1924
01:29:42.831 --> 01:29:43.560
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the idea behind it was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

1925
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:48.590
<v Speaker 1>There is everybody knows it's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an almost the identical clip in </v>

1926
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:53.601
<v Speaker 1>Cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look it up on youtube where a </v>

1927
01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:56.331
<v Speaker 1>guy where's sort of the aesthetic look </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he starts walking around Cairo and </v>

1928
01:29:56.331 --> 01:29:56.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not pretty.</v>

1929
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>What lucky you didn't get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1930
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just so fucking crazy that we're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world where we're at now where </v>

1931
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:08.970
<v Speaker 1>people are so terrified of the label,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia and of Islam,</v>

1932
01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:10.670
<v Speaker 1>of what happened with Charlie Hebdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1933
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Charlie Hebdo,</v>

1934
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a magazine and Paris,</v>

1935
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:19.230
<v Speaker 1>they would draw these cartoons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad and they were uh,</v>

1936
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 1>all the cartoonists were killed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>gunman,</v>

1937
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Muslim government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it say right here?</v>

1938
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down to the top please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie walk.</v>

1939
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Watch the abuse the Jewish man gets as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk through Paris.</v>

1940
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is from [inaudible] dot com and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking crazy.</v>

1941
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>The team film for Ten hours to get 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds of material that they had to go </v>

1942
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.430
<v Speaker 1>to the roughest parts of Paris to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1943
01:30:42.431 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>so they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1944
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:46.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1945
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1946
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:53.180
<v Speaker 1>so what they're saying I guess is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they really kind of blew it out of </v>

1947
01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:56.991
<v Speaker 1>proportion because they edited it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this 10 hours to get,</v>

1948
01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>to get 90 seconds.</v>

1949
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie said 90 seconds.</v>

1950
01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1951
01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:07.671
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to watch the youtube </v>

1952
01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:09.681
<v Speaker 1>clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to tell you about my </v>

1953
01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:09.681
<v Speaker 1>personal history in Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to hear some more stuff?</v>

1954
01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm maybe nine years old.</v>

1955
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the equivalent of great for here.</v>

1956
01:31:14.571 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three or four teacher says,</v>

1957
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:18.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

1958
01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.720
<v Speaker 1>here's the exercise for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1959
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:24.790
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get up and tell the class what you want </v>

1960
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.790
<v Speaker 1>to be when you grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1961
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:25.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

1962
01:31:25.321 --> 01:31:26.790
<v Speaker 1>my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a soccer player.</v>

1963
01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a policeman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be this.</v>

1964
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 1>He gets up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember his name.</v>

1965
01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I actually couldn't even recognize his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and the old photos.</v>

1966
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I grow up teacher,</v>

1967
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killer,</v>

1968
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.780
<v Speaker 1>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>

1969
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Everybody breaks out into applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1970
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:47.070
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that everybody in Lebanon</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this Rabid Anti Semite?</v>

1971
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is,</v>

1972
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:53.750
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our dose feelings pervasive through </v>

1973
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:57.500
<v Speaker 1>out every social fabric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be on TV and political </v>

1974
01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>speeches and dramas and soap operas.</v>

1975
01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.780
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere.</v>

1976
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:06.781
<v Speaker 3>It's endemic to every single DNA of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those societies.</v>

1977
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's why you have these types </v>

1978
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:14.161
<v Speaker 3>of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you another quick example of </v>

1979
01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:14.161
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that one real quick,</v>

1980
01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:14.780
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please do.</v>

1981
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So now we're getting into some serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine years old,</v>

1982
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:19.080
<v Speaker 3>nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine eight,</v>

1983
01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes radios in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1984
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going through your mind?</v>

1985
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 3>And this is a time where you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you as you said,</v>

1986
01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 3>you knew your place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

1987
01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:28.660
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>

1988
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 3>you didn't openly talk about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism or.</v>

1989
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're just,</v>

1990
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>

1991
01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 3>People know you because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're Jewish so it's not,</v>

1992
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:39.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your students did know I was,</v>

1993
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I was a student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you think this too,</v>

1994
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just your students follow suit?</v>

1995
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:48.030
<v Speaker 3>My cohorts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think many of them probably didn't </v>

1996
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.030
<v Speaker 3>know that I was Jewish.</v>

1997
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1998
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1999
01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:53.431
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't sit there and talk about these </v>

2000
01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:53.431
<v Speaker 3>issues as a kid said Ju killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2001
01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:54.040
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

2002
01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did that feel like?</v>

2003
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2004
01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:58.660
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like you're different.</v>

2005
01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.810
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're in a precarious </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation always.</v>

2006
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:03.840
<v Speaker 3>It feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2007
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:04.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and French.</v>

2008
01:33:04.591 --> 01:33:07.490
<v Speaker 3>There's an expression swab bell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means a,</v>

2009
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:10.000
<v Speaker 3>be pretty and sit quietly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2010
01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it know your place.</v>

2011
01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it means to be tolerant,</v>

2012
01:33:15.581 --> 01:33:17.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be tolerated.</v>

2013
01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:19.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that you're equal right here.</v>

2014
01:33:19.691 --> 01:33:24.691
<v Speaker 3>Never equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be prime minister of Lebanon </v>

2015
01:33:24.691 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 3>as a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you another quick story.</v>

2016
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2017
01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.600
<v Speaker 3>there was a general Egyptian politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>from say the seventies.</v>

2018
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:36.630
<v Speaker 3>There was a Abdulnasser was a famous Pan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabesque who brought together the Arab </v>

2019
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:37.120
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2020
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.000
<v Speaker 3>He was an Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a president who,</v>

2021
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.240
<v Speaker 3>who was viewed as the hero because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to sort of unite the Arab </v>

2022
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.160
<v Speaker 3>world against the colonial powers and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2023
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And so he was this kind of larger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>life superhero of the Arab world when he</v>

2024
01:33:53.231 --> 01:33:56.590
<v Speaker 3>died in 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as often happens in the Middle East,</v>

2025
01:33:56.591 --> 01:34:00.220
<v Speaker 3>there are all these incredibly sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent demonstrations on the streets.</v>

2026
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:02.950
<v Speaker 3>And I was sitting in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was maybe five years old,</v>

2027
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 3>almost six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as this mass of people pass,</v>

2028
01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:09.940
<v Speaker 3>by all you hear that the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jews,</v>

2029
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:15.150
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did the Jews have to do with this </v>

2030
01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 3>politician passing away in Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's just the reflex,</v>

2031
01:34:17.231 --> 01:34:17.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2032
01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.720
<v Speaker 3>it must be some Zionist conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be.</v>

2033
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:24.900
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting there sort of hiding in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my balcony as these people are passing </v>

2034
01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:28.830
<v Speaker 3>and it's etched in my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chance of death to Jews.</v>

2035
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.440
<v Speaker 3>And there are all these sort of Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance that I could repeat now that you </v>

2036
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:34.440
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't understand them.</v>

2037
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 3>That's just part of how things were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2038
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.840
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that on every single day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single day of my life there I was </v>

2039
01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 3>being persecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course not right.</v>

2040
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean I lived a normal life until I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be executed.</v>

2041
01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's the reality of the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>East.</v>

2042
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's why today you almost have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious minorities to speak of and you</v>

2043
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:55.330
<v Speaker 3>were in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2044
01:34:55.331 --> 01:35:00.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the remaining bastions of Christianity </v>

2045
01:35:00.331 --> 01:35:03.310
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East are now either being </v>
<v Speaker 3>clobbered or they're forced to leave </v>

2046
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:04.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Iraq,</v>

2047
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2048
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 3>the cops in Egypt to some extent now </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing it also in Nigeria.</v>

2049
01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

2050
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that we all kind of coexist in</v>

2051
01:35:15.231 --> 01:35:16.460
<v Speaker 3>the released.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Bologna.</v>

2052
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're tolerated at best.</v>

2053
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:24.310
<v Speaker 3>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the percentage of people that </v>

2054
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.310
<v Speaker 3>were Jews in Lebanon when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2055
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 3>So at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were part of the last remaining </v>

2056
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Jews in Lebanon at one point I think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be off on the numbers and you'll </v>

2057
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:34.730
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe in the descriptor,</v>

2058
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>at most.</v>

2059
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.260
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$20,000</v>

2060
01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:41.010
<v Speaker 3>out of a population of about maybe $3 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million at the zenith.</v>

2061
01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a very small minority.</v>

2062
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Now when Israel came along in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made it that much more difficult to </v>

2063
01:35:50.331 --> 01:35:55.331
<v Speaker 3>be Jewish and Arab countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is not to give cover to </v>

2064
01:35:55.331 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 3>antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is independent of Israel,</v>

2065
01:35:56.090 --> 01:36:01.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antisemitism has existed for 1400 years </v>

2066
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:01.090
<v Speaker 3>in those parts of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>independently of Israel.</v>

2067
01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:06.220
<v Speaker 3>But once Israel came about in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just made it that much more </v>

2068
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:10.001
<v Speaker 3>precarious for Jews to live in Libya and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and in Egypt and in Syria and </v>

2069
01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:10.001
<v Speaker 3>Lebanon.</v>

2070
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:14.510
<v Speaker 3>And so they'd be these mass exoduses of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews from Arab lands,</v>

2071
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.660
<v Speaker 3>sometimes forced other times by choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it just became untenable for </v>

2072
01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:24.401
<v Speaker 3>Jews to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were part of the last wave of </v>

2073
01:36:24.401 --> 01:36:27.821
<v Speaker 3>remaining Jews because we were very </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrenched within Lebanese society.</v>

2074
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then once the civil war started and </v>

2075
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:33.320
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't possible to be there in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebanon,</v>

2076
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.841
<v Speaker 3>you had these internal ID cards that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>carried around like a passport,</v>

2077
01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:41.420
<v Speaker 3>but internally that stated your religion</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

2078
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:46.870
<v Speaker 3>So in the context of the Lebanese civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>war where they would set up these </v>

2079
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.870
<v Speaker 3>roadblocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these militia would set up roadblocks.</v>

2080
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:49.640
<v Speaker 3>If you get to a roadblock and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>says in Arabic,</v>

2081
01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:51.950
<v Speaker 3>you say how we give me your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2082
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:52.700
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2083
01:36:52.701 --> 01:36:54.020
<v Speaker 3>your ID card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2084
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 3>that ID card has your religion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're the wrong religion,</v>

2085
01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:59.220
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bye.</v>

2086
01:36:59.950 --> 01:37:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what's going on with the Sunni </v>

2087
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.950
<v Speaker 3>and Shiite in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2088
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:05.900
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roadblocks,</v>

2089
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.580
<v Speaker 3>roadblocks to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2090
01:37:07.581 --> 01:37:12.200
<v Speaker 3>the problem in the Middle East is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have endless abrahamic religions.</v>

2091
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:13.970
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the Mazda,</v>

2092
01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not trying to be relativists </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2093
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but all the abrahamic religions sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a narrative of uniqueness and it's </v>

2094
01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:24.300
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard to coexist when you know,</v>

2095
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.910
<v Speaker 3>each of us is the chosen people.</v>

2096
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I have my theory about the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my theory is that they're the </v>

2097
01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:32.890
<v Speaker 1>townies of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2098
01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.770
<v Speaker 1>The townies are the people that never </v>
<v Speaker 1>left their neighborhood.</v>

2099
01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the cradle of </v>

2100
01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Babylon.</v>

2101
01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's sue mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the oldest written language,</v>

2102
01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:47.410
<v Speaker 1>oldest mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where Iraq is,</v>

2103
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:49.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that area is a clusterfuck today.</v>

2104
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And everybody moved out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody moved out of Africa.</v>

2105
01:37:53.351 --> 01:37:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Africa's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2106
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2107
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2108
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.840
<v Speaker 2>think that much like small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grow up in and if you go back,</v>

2109
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>there you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2110
01:38:01.531 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking assholes are still hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the high school,</v>

2111
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being annoying at the gas station.</v>

2112
01:38:06.461 --> 01:38:07.320
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same people there.</v>

2113
01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:10.770
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have not evolved,</v>

2114
01:38:10.771 --> 01:38:15.771
<v Speaker 2>they have not moved past the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world has and it seems like with a lot </v>

2115
01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:19.551
<v Speaker 2>of these religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so rigid in their ideology and </v>

2116
01:38:19.551 --> 01:38:23.961
<v Speaker 2>the standards of their behavior and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classifications of the individuals that </v>

2117
01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>are involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost inescapable.</v>

2118
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>These rigid ideology seem like it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of progressive thinking or </v>

2119
01:38:32.071 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 2>progressive thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost.</v>

2120
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 2>They're almost mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have that and exist in that.</v>

2121
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:45.260
<v Speaker 2>In that form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coalitional thinking is a endemic part </v>

2122
01:38:46.021 --> 01:38:46.980
<v Speaker 2>of human psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2123
01:38:46.981 --> 01:38:51.981
<v Speaker 2>The idea of us versus them as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human nature and what these Abrahamic </v>

2124
01:38:52.651 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 2>religions do is they take this and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>put her on steroids.</v>

2125
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it it.</v>

2126
01:38:57.190 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 2>It is a great study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember who it is or I might </v>

2127
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:02.250
<v Speaker 2>punch it up a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it goes something like this.</v>

2128
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:07.490
<v Speaker 2>You're bringing people into the lab and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you make them wait in the waiting area </v>

2129
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 2>and you just put a sticker either blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>or red on them and then you say,</v>

2130
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to come back in a few </v>

2131
01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go off to do something </v>

2132
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be back in a few minutes.</v>

2133
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.060
<v Speaker 2>The real point of the experiment is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what people ended up doing during </v>

2134
01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 2>that time that you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happens?</v>

2135
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.380
<v Speaker 2>The people who have the red sticks read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stickers,</v>

2136
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.450
<v Speaker 2>start speaking to each other and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2137
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.480
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're taking a completely random </v>

2138
01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.520
<v Speaker 2>queue and you're forcing people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assort along that cute right now,</v>

2139
01:39:34.651 --> 01:39:39.651
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer matters what my sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation is or whether I'm Muslim or </v>

2140
01:39:39.651 --> 01:39:39.651
<v Speaker 2>Christian or Jewish.</v>

2141
01:39:39.651 --> 01:39:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It's red people band together versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>blue people.</v>

2142
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:47.151
<v Speaker 2>There are various versions of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment that had been done and in </v>

2143
01:39:47.151 --> 01:39:49.140
<v Speaker 2>classic social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what that speaks to is this,</v>

2144
01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.890
<v Speaker 2>a inextricable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2145
01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:56.891
<v Speaker 2>this inescapable trap of coalitional </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and that's what happens in </v>

2146
01:39:56.891 --> 01:40:01.521
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is viewed through the prism </v>

2147
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:04.730
<v Speaker 2>of my faith and anybody who's not my </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith is the other and the other is not.</v>

2148
01:40:05.281 --> 01:40:08.160
<v Speaker 2>To be trusted is to be hated as to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>scoring that.</v>

2149
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that every single </v>

2150
01:40:13.190 --> 01:40:14.421
<v Speaker 2>person subscribes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly means that the </v>

2151
01:40:14.421 --> 01:40:17.451
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious narratives certainly </v>

2152
01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:17.451
<v Speaker 2>condones that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2153
01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:21.381
<v Speaker 2>with rigid ideologies and tribal </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and then add that to a very </v>

2154
01:40:21.381 --> 01:40:25.551
<v Speaker 2>harsh environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical environment where it's just </v>

2155
01:40:25.551 --> 01:40:29.420
<v Speaker 2>unforgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real hard to move past that real </v>

2156
01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.871
<v Speaker 2>hard to find forgiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and see in and matter of </v>

2157
01:40:32.871 --> 01:40:37.101
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things is another </v>

2158
01:40:37.101 --> 01:40:38.481
<v Speaker 2>issue that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Michael Shermer who </v>

2159
01:40:38.481 --> 01:40:40.671
<v Speaker 2>wrote an article about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Islam and some of the other </v>

2160
01:40:40.671 --> 01:40:42.620
<v Speaker 2>religions is that they never went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the enlightenment.</v>

2161
01:40:42.621 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2162
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the.</v>

2163
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:50.540
<v Speaker 2>You now see many a vociferous in public </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals that are coming out to a </v>

2164
01:40:52.290 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>call for an reformation,</v>

2165
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 3>but that's actually been happening for </v>
<v Speaker 3>1400 years.</v>

2166
01:40:56.261 --> 01:41:01.261
<v Speaker 3>The problem is it's easy to call for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformation if you assume that there's </v>

2167
01:41:01.261 --> 01:41:03.220
<v Speaker 3>something to be reformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think it's perfect.</v>

2168
01:41:03.221 --> 01:41:08.221
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to be reformed right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here in PA state for even considering </v>

2169
01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to reform it,</v>

2170
01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:11.380
<v Speaker 3>how do you go about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When one of the tenants,</v>

2171
01:41:11.381 --> 01:41:15.240
<v Speaker 3>the tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that in Arabic you say a kid,</v>

2172
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:20.790
<v Speaker 3>meaning every single letter of the Koran</v>
<v Speaker 3>is immutable,</v>

2173
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:23.350
<v Speaker 3>is eternal and it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2174
01:41:23.351 --> 01:41:27.980
<v Speaker 3>how can you have an exit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just how could you exit just as like a,</v>

2175
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not pronouncing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like how could you interpret texts </v>

2176
01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.941
<v Speaker 3>or reinterpret texts when in reality you</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that becomes a form of </v>

2177
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:39.340
<v Speaker 3>sacrilegious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2178
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:42.820
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem in the context of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other Abrahamic religions,</v>

2179
01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:48.540
<v Speaker 3>there was the capacity for the light of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformation to squeeze its way into </v>

2180
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 3>those little holes so that there could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be new interpretations and so on.</v>

2181
01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:57.650
<v Speaker 3>In Islam it's a bit more of a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what about people that are Islamic </v>

2182
01:41:57.761 --> 01:42:02.761
<v Speaker 3>reformers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are the members of the people in </v>

2183
01:42:02.761 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people today that considered </v>

2184
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:08.551
<v Speaker 3>themselves Muslim but also are atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that consider </v>

2185
01:42:08.551 --> 01:42:12.391
<v Speaker 3>themselves Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you consider yourself a Jew but </v>

2186
01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:12.391
<v Speaker 3>you're an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2187
01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 3>What about those people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't so ideologically rigid,</v>

2188
01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 3>rigid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think they all moved right there.</v>

2189
01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Don't move down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they certainly never openly stated </v>

2190
01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:23.810
<v Speaker 3>they're not unbelief in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during Ramadan with that.</v>

2191
01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:26.020
<v Speaker 3>That would not be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be good.</v>

2192
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 3>They'll fuck you up if you eat during </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ramadan.</v>

2193
01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2194
01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:33.540
<v Speaker 3>and certainly isis now has killed many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who violated a Ramadan rules,</v>

2195
01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2196
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:41.071
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll hear back that they're not </v>

2197
01:42:41.071 --> 01:42:41.071
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not Islamic,</v>

2198
01:42:41.071 --> 01:42:41.071
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do hear that.</v>

2199
01:42:41.071 --> 01:42:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've engaged people in various forums </v>

2200
01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:45.090
<v Speaker 3>where we start chatting.</v>

2201
01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll quote something from say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know who he is?</v>

2202
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 3>He's the spiritual leader of the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brotherhood.</v>

2203
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.140
<v Speaker 3>One of the foremost leaders of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunni.</v>

2204
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 3>A Sec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of as a religious scholar,</v>

2205
01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:03.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all the perfect right pedigree </v>

2206
01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:05.650
<v Speaker 3>from an scholar scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic scholarship perspective.</v>

2207
01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.040
<v Speaker 3>So I'll quote something by him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think there were about the </v>

2208
01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Olivia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not a real Muslim.</v>

2209
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll quote something from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>college of the so called Colophon Lysis </v>

2210
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:23.850
<v Speaker 3>who has a phd in Islamic Studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the answer is not a </v>

2211
01:43:23.850 --> 01:43:25.790
<v Speaker 3>real Muslim then I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2212
01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's play.</v>

2213
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Hide the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2214
01:43:28.211 --> 01:43:30.850
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have so much duplicity in your</v>

2215
01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:35.851
<v Speaker 3>discourse that guys who by definition </v>
<v Speaker 3>are leaders and experts of Islam who are</v>

2216
01:43:37.691 --> 01:43:42.691
<v Speaker 3>then being a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pretend that they're not Muslim </v>

2217
01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:46.200
<v Speaker 3>because they say something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find objectionable than how can we </v>

2218
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.830
<v Speaker 3>have an often and honest discourse you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

2219
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:49.960
<v Speaker 3>so how do we fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my my,</v>

2220
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.040
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my running.</v>

2221
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2222
01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 2>my last podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we fix this?</v>

2223
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I think we fixed it with everything by </v>
<v Speaker 2>having people who have the courage as </v>

2224
01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 2>many of some of your guests have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can include myself in this group</v>

2225
01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 2>who are open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are honest,</v>

2226
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:09.910
<v Speaker 2>who are reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not filled with hate to who are </v>

2227
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.130
<v Speaker 2>dispassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2228
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.460
<v Speaker 2>they moved all of the moved moved out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East.</v>

2229
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.000
<v Speaker 2>So you're just saying that they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement these changes on the ground.</v>

2230
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2231
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:21.270
<v Speaker 2>how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not sure if,</v>

2232
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I think if I've got the answer then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be getting the Nobel prize.</v>

2233
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Who is the writer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2234
01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.360
<v Speaker 2>something Roy that was hacked to death </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the machete rails?</v>

2235
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been for them so far.</v>

2236
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was somewhere else doing a,</v>

2237
01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 2>it was some sort of a speech on his book</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wrote back to Bangladesh was </v>

2238
01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 2>hacked.</v>

2239
01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Hacked to death by machetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2241
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.120
<v Speaker 2>on the street in front of his wife was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hacked up to was horrible.</v>

2242
01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what the response is when I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged people on that.</v>

2243
01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.790
<v Speaker 2>What they did was not Islamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2244
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you an example.</v>

2245
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

2246
01:44:56.870 --> 01:45:01.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recent Orthodox Jew who in the gay </v>

2247
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:03.900
<v Speaker 2>pride parade in Tel Aviv that Ed did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have on this?</v>

2248
01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I did hear about this with stabbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2249
01:45:05.661 --> 01:45:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Stabbing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2250
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2251
01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do this because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>alienated.</v>

2252
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do this as a response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis of 2007,</v>

2253
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:16.910
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using examples,</v>

2254
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:21.911
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Russell brand's luminary analysis </v>

2255
01:45:21.911 --> 01:45:23.900
<v Speaker 2>as to why people join isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to hold up.</v>

2256
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Russell brand thinks that Russell and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2257
01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I did a youtube clip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2258
01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 2>on my youtube channel where I basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered all this.</v>

2259
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 2>The comedian Russell brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2260
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.100
<v Speaker 2>The luminary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luminary sarcastically.</v>

2261
01:45:37.101 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically was arguing that,</v>

2262
01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2263
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.200
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2264
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:46.270
<v Speaker 2>he came up with every single possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that you could think of other than</v>

2265
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:50.870
<v Speaker 2>religious fervor to explain why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>move 4,000</v>

2266
01:45:50.871 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 2>miles away to join isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was due.</v>

2267
01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were about maybe seven or eight.</v>

2268
01:45:55.701 --> 01:45:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I covered on my youtube clip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>

2269
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to come up with three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were alienated.</v>

2270
01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:04.000
<v Speaker 2>They felt that they weren't part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political process.</v>

2271
01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Want to say it the way he says it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2272
01:46:05.650 --> 01:46:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really alienated,</v>

2273
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:11.570
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel like they are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political process.</v>

2274
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it as well as you can.</v>

2275
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

2276
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:20.620
<v Speaker 2>they were upset about the financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>meltdown in 2017 financial meltdown.</v>

2277
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 2>They hated greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rampant evil capitalism.</v>

2278
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2279
01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:30.890
<v Speaker 2>My son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the right words.</v>

2280
01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2281
01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:34.290
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really that's,</v>

2282
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:39.350
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason why people join.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing to do with </v>

2283
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.350
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely nothing to do with it.</v>

2284
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:44.080
<v Speaker 2>So how could we have an honest discourse</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this is the kind of nonsense that </v>

2285
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.561
<v Speaker 2>you keep hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking to comedians and </v>

2286
01:46:47.561 --> 01:46:47.561
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking to a comedian right now.</v>

2287
01:46:47.561 --> 01:46:49.990
<v Speaker 2>So any logic out of this healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit some,</v>

2288
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>some people actually challenged me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2289
01:46:51.661 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you even take the time to counter</v>

2290
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy's views?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2291
01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and my answer is he's got a lot bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform than I do,</v>

2292
01:47:00.130 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has much more power to influence </v>

2293
01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:05.730
<v Speaker 1>minds than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that I might be better</v>

2294
01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:10.731
<v Speaker 1>equipped than him as he's an athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there's been athletes and that sort </v>

2295
01:47:10.731 --> 01:47:10.731
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2296
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like they're both kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing for social brownie points </v>

2297
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>instead of calling it Islam or instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of calling it anything,</v>

2298
01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:21.600
<v Speaker 1>if you just looked at it as a pattern or</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

2299
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you looked at that pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

2300
01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:28.490
<v Speaker 1>this ideological pattern or behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would seek out to murder people </v>

2301
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that don't agree with those thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any rational person would go,</v>

2302
01:47:31.501 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 1>well that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2303
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That's these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are fucked.</v>

2304
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bad,</v>

2305
01:47:35.341 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 1>we can't tolerate this.</v>

2306
01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:42.050
<v Speaker 1>But once you start calling it anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you call it Islam or just fill </v>

2307
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 1>in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make up your own name for it.</v>

2308
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 1>And then that becomes an oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>segment of our civilization,</v>

2309
01:47:48.150 --> 01:47:53.150
<v Speaker 1>or at least a thought of as an oppressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or boxed into that political,</v>

2310
01:47:53.191 --> 01:47:56.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a segment where you're,</v>

2311
01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to shit on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's thought to be marginalized </v>

2312
01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:03.580
<v Speaker 1>already and you're just piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that.</v>

2313
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So there are 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back in a second,</v>

2314
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me answer this last point you </v>

2315
01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:14.031
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that in the 57 countries </v>

2316
01:48:14.031 --> 01:48:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that are a member of the Organization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic cooperation,</v>

2317
01:48:14.491 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 1>the OIC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Muslims are marginalized?</v>

2318
01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2319
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:22.611
<v Speaker 1>And most of those 57 countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they constitute an extraordinary </v>

2320
01:48:22.611 --> 01:48:26.150
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not complete majority of it </v>

2321
01:48:26.150 --> 01:48:26.150
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

2322
01:48:26.150 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 1>this narrative that Muslims are </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized.</v>

2323
01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really laughable because I mean,</v>

2324
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:31.380
<v Speaker 1>if you think about Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yemen,</v>

2325
01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>

2326
01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

2327
01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>

2328
01:48:35.101 --> 01:48:36.020
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2329
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:37.380
<v Speaker 1>they're not marginalized.</v>

2330
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 1>They constitute 99 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent of the population,</v>

2331
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything is the religious minorities </v>

2332
01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:45.990
<v Speaker 1>that are no longer existent there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been marginalized,</v>

2333
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's eliminated,</v>

2334
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.090
<v Speaker 1>eliminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or exit or genocidally removed.</v>

2335
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2336
01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.270
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an informational war.</v>

2337
01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2338
01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:57.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important part.</v>

2339
01:48:57.390 --> 01:49:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's an inflammation of war and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and ideology that it,</v>

2340
01:49:01.661 --> 01:49:03.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's these things,</v>

2341
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:05.400
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are thoughts and patterns.</v>

2342
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Instead of calling them religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of calling this,</v>

2343
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:12.320
<v Speaker 1>this cherished tradition or cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2344
01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.190
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2345
01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:18.260
<v Speaker 1>this ancient thing that you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to worship instead of calling it that,</v>

2346
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ideas.</v>

2347
01:49:21.361 --> 01:49:26.361
<v Speaker 1>These are ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas that this ancient script is </v>

2348
01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 1>directly handed down from God that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>word is perfect.</v>

2349
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:33.830
<v Speaker 1>If that's not preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what the fuck is because I </v>

2350
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:37.551
<v Speaker 1>get real confused when people who grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up without any science,</v>

2351
01:49:37.681 --> 01:49:42.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally knew almost nothing when </v>

2352
01:49:42.681 --> 01:49:42.681
<v Speaker 1>they wrote this in comparison to what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know today.</v>

2353
01:49:42.681 --> 01:49:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Obviously back then there were scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right in comparison,</v>

2354
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's laughable to think that anybody</v>

2355
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.780
<v Speaker 2>had all the answers in 1200 or years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Koran,</v>

2356
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Britain supposedly in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelations.</v>

2357
01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:57.250
<v Speaker 2>So 600 something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>600,</v>

2358
01:49:57.251 --> 01:49:58.580
<v Speaker 2>so 680.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:04.430
<v Speaker 2>About 1400 years ago to try reading any </v>
<v Speaker 2>and textbook book from 1400 years ago </v>

2360
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and finding correct information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2361
01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:12.460
<v Speaker 2>What year was Galileo prosecuted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 something that's going back to the </v>

2362
01:50:12.701 --> 01:50:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Jewish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2363
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted about it and I shared it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

2364
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he undoubtedly got his ideas from,</v>

2365
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I think reading leviticus where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:50:24.611 --> 01:50:26.440
<v Speaker 2>if you lay with another man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be killed.</v>

2367
01:50:26.441 --> 01:50:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2368
01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:32.340
<v Speaker 2>So if I make that claim right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an absolutely correct claim </v>

2369
01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:36.451
<v Speaker 2>that for this guy who took his old </v>
<v Speaker 2>testament very seriously and then went </v>

2370
01:50:36.451 --> 01:50:41.041
<v Speaker 2>around knifing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolutely appropriate claim to </v>

2371
01:50:41.041 --> 01:50:43.140
<v Speaker 2>make either didn't get attacked as </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic.</v>

2372
01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody says,</v>

2373
01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>

2374
01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:49.980
<v Speaker 2>An Orthodox Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very rare for an orthodox Jew </v>

2375
01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:49.980
<v Speaker 2>to go around killing people.</v>

2376
01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:51.580
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that I made that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could make that link,</v>

2377
01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:56.940
<v Speaker 2>there was no blow back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately the West has now been </v>

2378
01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:01.021
<v Speaker 2>convinced that if you ever make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>link for one particular religion than </v>

2379
01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:05.641
<v Speaker 2>you are hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a profoundly dangerous situation </v>

2380
01:51:05.641 --> 01:51:06.520
<v Speaker 2>to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem to,</v>

2381
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:11.550
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be legal in this game to a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shit all over Christians.</v>

2382
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2383
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a matter of fact,</v>

2384
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:19.981
<v Speaker 2>if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really progressive amongst my </v>

2385
01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:23.071
<v Speaker 2>academic friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you repeatedly demonstrate what a </v>

2386
01:51:23.071 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 2>bunch of buffoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2387
01:51:23.291 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 2>these Christian Pixar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that garners you Brownie points.</v>

2388
01:51:27.370 --> 01:51:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are Christian Hicks?</v>

2389
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm any less profound than these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2390
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:39.390
<v Speaker 2>because because it slices for Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrongly is associated with Brown people </v>

2391
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and you don't mess with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of baptists are black.</v>

2392
01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:46.150
<v Speaker 2>True,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2393
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Do people mock southern Baptist as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they mark like a.</v>

2394
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 2>that's an open empirical question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2395
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

2396
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I bet they kind of leave that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start singing and chanting against </v>

2397
01:51:59.130 --> 01:51:59.130
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2398
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2399
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Solfa old apostolic is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

2400
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2401
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.860
<v Speaker 2>it's tough dealing with all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis on twitter and so on.</v>

2402
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to be judged in a </v>

2403
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:17.040
<v Speaker 2>negative way and especially in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

2404
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.610
<v Speaker 2>in this culture and this easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2405
01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 2>act culture because it's really easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a tweet about someone or write a </v>

2406
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>facebook post about someone or a blog </v>
<v Speaker 2>entry about someone attacking them.</v>

2407
01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.520
<v Speaker 2>And then once you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2408
01:52:30.521 --> 01:52:35.521
<v Speaker 2>you have opened up the flood gates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they will just experience all sorts of </v>

2409
01:52:35.521 --> 01:52:39.751
<v Speaker 2>pylons from all these other people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are either agree or support or or don't </v>

2410
01:52:39.751 --> 01:52:40.720
<v Speaker 2>want to be labeled such themselves.</v>

2411
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So they'll attack you to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that they're not like </v>

2412
01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2413
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that you say that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because some of the biggest blow back </v>

2414
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten on my public facebook page </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been,</v>

2415
01:52:52.251 --> 01:52:55.010
<v Speaker 2>whenever I've called out Russell brand </v>
<v Speaker 2>on something,</v>

2416
01:52:55.490 --> 01:53:00.410
<v Speaker 2>apparently some of my fans are also </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell brand fans,</v>

2417
01:53:00.411 --> 01:53:02.830
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know how these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldviews can,</v>

2418
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:05.960
<v Speaker 2>can coexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they got really upset that,</v>

2419
01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was being elitist.</v>

2420
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing a lot of social good.</v>

2421
01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of his stuff is quackery,</v>

2422
01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:17.051
<v Speaker 2>but he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His heart is in the right place and I'm </v>

2423
01:53:17.051 --> 01:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>being an asshole for criticizing him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really,</v>

2424
01:53:17.601 --> 01:53:20.480
<v Speaker 2>really at Vitriol for some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

2425
01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never lived in the middle.</v>

2426
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>

2427
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you've never heard anybody yell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed it.</v>

2428
01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

2429
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Now incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>

2430
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I should mention that my first exposure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Russell brand before I knew about all</v>

2431
01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:36.250
<v Speaker 2>his funny movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well exactly,</v>

2432
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:41.290
<v Speaker 2>and one one in one in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I must have seen about 10 times a </v>

2433
01:53:41.290 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 2>forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Marshall.</v>

2434
01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2435
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 2>and so I've sat there and laughed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was a very funny guy.</v>

2436
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I came across his political </v>
<v Speaker 2>rants and I no longer thought he was </v>

2437
01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 2>such a cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2438
01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:54.680
<v Speaker 2>as I've said on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he is neck deep in hippie</v>

2439
01:53:54.681 --> 01:53:57.320
<v Speaker 2>pussy right now and really has no idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

2440
01:53:57.350 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I think they cut off the circulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's that much hippie pussy </v>

2441
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 2>coming at Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the circulation to your brain,</v>

2442
01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:08.080
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard for the heart to pump it </v>
<v Speaker 2>through all the kisses that he received </v>

2443
01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 2>on his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It right.</v>

2444
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the going theory.</v>

2445
01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty good one.</v>

2446
01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they throw themselves at that poor </v>

2447
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2448
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2449
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Looking at this beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2450
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Used to date Katy Perry who was married </v>
<v Speaker 2>to her son.</v>

2451
01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.880
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to that list?</v>

2452
01:54:24.881 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Full Union had to save the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

2453
01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Popstars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2454
01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:31.870
<v Speaker 2>That's all that frivolous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 2>She was religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

2456
01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:35.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2457
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her exact story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently she was very,</v>

2458
01:54:38.301 --> 01:54:43.020
<v Speaker 2>very religious and her original sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>foray into the music industry all about,</v>

2459
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Christian religious music.</v>

2460
01:54:45.471 --> 01:54:50.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when that sort of didn't stick </v>

2461
01:54:50.471 --> 01:54:50.471
<v Speaker 2>then she became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2462
01:54:50.471 --> 01:54:51.470
<v Speaker 2>kind of deviated from that and became a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pop star.</v>

2463
01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.130
<v Speaker 2>But her roots are very much a Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>based.</v>

2464
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:54:56.630 --> 01:54:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of these folks with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2466
01:54:58.581 --> 01:55:00.980
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do good like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>russell.</v>

2467
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2468
01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I probably get along with them.</v>

2469
01:55:05.241 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Great if I sat down and talked to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think he,</v>

2470
01:55:08.690 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 2>when I hear him talk and I hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that he's saying,</v>

2471
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he is doing a lot of good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is opening up a lot of </v>

2472
01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:19.541
<v Speaker 2>people's eyes because he is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>public figure and he is saying a lot of </v>

2473
01:55:19.541 --> 01:55:21.680
<v Speaker 2>things that make a lot of sense about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the financial world,</v>

2474
01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.540
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2475
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:29.530
<v Speaker 2>about war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about the nature of controlling </v>

2476
01:55:29.530 --> 01:55:33.191
<v Speaker 2>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that he says </v>

2477
01:55:33.191 --> 01:55:35.501
<v Speaker 2>that I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that when you get caught up </v>

2478
01:55:35.501 --> 01:55:38.411
<v Speaker 2>in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some very clear sort of </v>

2479
01:55:38.411 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 2>behavior patterns that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to.</v>

2480
01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And this Islamophobia label is one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid all fucking</v>

2481
01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.440
<v Speaker 3>costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get hit with that one,</v>

2482
01:55:46.441 --> 01:55:51.441
<v Speaker 3>that's a heavy one today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So heavy one and this politically </v>

2483
01:55:51.441 --> 01:55:51.441
<v Speaker 3>charged world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2484
01:55:51.441 --> 01:55:55.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made this point on a show recently </v>

2485
01:55:55.211 --> 01:55:55.211
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2486
01:55:55.211 --> 01:55:55.580
<v Speaker 3>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2487
01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.960
<v Speaker 3>the Islam narrative doesn't yet have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>power to literally be had people.</v>

2488
01:56:01.831 --> 01:56:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2489
01:56:02.271 --> 01:56:05.640
<v Speaker 3>if you say some really nasty stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>against Islam and the Middle East,</v>

2490
01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:08.160
<v Speaker 3>what we can solve that problem easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get rid of you.</v>

2491
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:13.910
<v Speaker 3>But in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you could do is you could be head </v>

2492
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.910
<v Speaker 3>somebody's reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2493
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:17.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean them and metaphorical beheading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens to guys like Sam</v>

2494
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2495
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2496
01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2497
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:24.380
<v Speaker 3>I've never really faced this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blowback.</v>

2498
01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe because I'm somewhat more measured</v>

2499
01:56:26.851 --> 01:56:31.851
<v Speaker 3>in how I speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly sure why you're also </v>

2500
01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:32.000
<v Speaker 3>talking about your personal income,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2501
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:37.430
<v Speaker 3>which gives you more authenticity </v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas Sam is viewed as some white guy </v>

2502
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:38.190
<v Speaker 3>who's speaking from a fucking cracker.</v>

2503
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2504
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what you see there are all</v>

2505
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know about them,</v>

2506
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I won't even mention them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't give them any,</v>

2507
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 3>any airplay that go around pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>blaming everything on.</v>

2508
01:56:49.531 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 3>So called new atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2509
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris Are these</v>

2510
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:59.380
<v Speaker 3>sort of evil patriarchs before he died </v>
<v Speaker 3>just before that.</v>

2511
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And you and use the fourth horseman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another Daniel Dennett dude.</v>

2512
01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2513
01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 3>are you joking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you being serious?</v>

2514
01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2515
01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:11.910
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a philosopher at a school in Boston</v>

2516
01:57:11.911 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe brandeis,</v>

2517
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those schools.</v>

2518
01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

2519
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go around just smearing these guys,</v>

2520
01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:22.090
<v Speaker 3>their hate mongers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're evil.</v>

2521
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:25.410
<v Speaker 3>A lot of gravity attached to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2522
01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:27.960
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now people who want to come into the</v>

2523
01:57:27.961 --> 01:57:32.961
<v Speaker 3>discussion have to really think hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they want to be exposed to this </v>

2524
01:57:33.901 --> 01:57:34.800
<v Speaker 3>kind of blowback.</v>

2525
01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.200
<v Speaker 3>And so you get self censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2526
01:57:37.230 --> 01:57:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had,</v>

2527
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:41.020
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think I've shared this story</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever again,</v>

2528
01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:45.930
<v Speaker 3>so double happy birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've had my wife,</v>

2529
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.960
<v Speaker 3>so I opened up my laptop and I start </v>
<v Speaker 3>typing something and she'll come around </v>

2530
01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.870
<v Speaker 3>nervously looking at what I'm typing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

2531
01:57:52.871 --> 01:57:53.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2532
01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Why are you hovering over me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

2533
01:57:55.990 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 3>and I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this should give chills to anybody </v>

2534
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 3>listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

2535
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:02.190
<v Speaker 3>remember we have two children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2536
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm thinking in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 3>century a professor in Canada now,</v>

2537
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.030
<v Speaker 3>even if my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

2538
01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:14.031
<v Speaker 3>we're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if she's overestimating the threat </v>

2539
01:58:14.031 --> 01:58:14.940
<v Speaker 3>of the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that she has the,</v>

2540
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:19.941
<v Speaker 3>reflects the intuition to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>engage in that behavior,</v>

2541
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 3>to have those thought patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

2542
01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:28.120
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really demonstrating that the </v>

2543
01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.000
<v Speaker 3>canaries singing in the proverbial coal </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine and it's not pretty right now.</v>

2544
01:58:30.001 --> 01:58:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point.</v>

2545
01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I could either tweet whatever it is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was tweeting,</v>

2546
01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:35.310
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I could say,</v>

2547
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2548
01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:40.940
<v Speaker 3>she might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me engage in self censorship and </v>

2549
01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 3>every time that someone who otherwise</v>

2550
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:46.060
<v Speaker 2>would be weighing in on the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in self censorship,</v>

2551
01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 2>the other side winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where we're at now.</v>

2552
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.550
<v Speaker 2>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we resolve this issue?</v>

2553
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully people grow a pair a and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>weighing in on the matter.</v>

2554
01:58:56.490 --> 01:59:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that one of the arguments </v>

2555
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:02.911
<v Speaker 2>about publishing the images from Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hebdo that no one wanted to do exactly </v>

2556
01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:08.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Astonishing these people lost their </v>

2557
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.000
<v Speaker 2>lives and the fight of a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2558
01:59:10.001 --> 01:59:14.230
<v Speaker 2>the foundational bedrock of all our </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedoms is freedom of speech.</v>

2559
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:19.350
<v Speaker 2>They lost their lives defending that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single western media coward and </v>

2560
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:23.350
<v Speaker 2>decided not to show it in every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2561
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean pretty much every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Every single magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean New York Times didn't last treats</v>

2563
01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:30.060
<v Speaker 2>titled in the time did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2564
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 2>nobody did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2565
01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:36.360
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one guy as relevant and Canada </v>

2566
01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:40.170
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who published the original in 2006 and </v>

2567
01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:42.820
<v Speaker 2>he was taken to a hate speech tribunal </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>

2568
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2569
01:59:43.841 --> 01:59:48.841
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How or William is that a guy could be </v>

2570
01:59:48.841 --> 01:59:51.250
<v Speaker 2>taken to a hate speech tribunal for </v>
<v Speaker 2>publishing these cartoons.</v>

2571
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:56.230
<v Speaker 2>It's astonishing is supposedly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons are offensive.</v>

2572
01:59:56.231 --> 01:59:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some of the cartoons and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just thought they were kind of stupid,</v>

2573
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem a little on the racist side,</v>

2574
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:08.370
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that these kids get you </v>

2575
02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:10.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to show you the cartoons </v>

2576
02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.841
<v Speaker 2>that are published every day in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East media about Jews couldn't </v>

2577
02:00:12.841 --> 02:00:13.600
<v Speaker 2>have managed care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know what I mean?</v>

2578
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Now the reality is we should all try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get along.</v>

2579
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:18.940
<v Speaker 2>We should all be respectful of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

2580
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't go out of your way to harm</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's feelings,</v>

2581
02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.830
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to testing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of freedom of speech,</v>

2582
02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:29.470
<v Speaker 2>there should be no boundaries that can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be crossed.</v>

2583
02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be.</v>

2584
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:34.070
<v Speaker 2>There should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be no boundaries.</v>

2585
02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It should be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2586
02:00:35.250 --> 02:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the,</v>

2587
02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:40.000
<v Speaker 2>when these things come up where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is at stake,</v>

2588
02:00:40.001 --> 02:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>like your wife hanging over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder saying,</v>

2589
02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:47.940
<v Speaker 2>remember we have children and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have no time magazine,</v>

2590
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>that Own New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles Times,</v>

2591
02:00:50.621 --> 02:00:54.400
<v Speaker 2>they think about publishing these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just back off.</v>

2592
02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have families,</v>

2593
02:00:56.321 --> 02:01:01.321
<v Speaker 2>they have lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be the sacrificial </v>

2594
02:01:01.321 --> 02:01:03.631
<v Speaker 2>lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to put a name to those </v>

2595
02:01:03.631 --> 02:01:03.970
<v Speaker 2>articles and they publish them and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that the editor knows,</v>

2596
02:01:03.971 --> 02:01:08.971
<v Speaker 2>the publisher knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all know that someone's going to </v>

2597
02:01:08.971 --> 02:01:08.971
<v Speaker 2>find out who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's crazy,</v>

2598
02:01:08.971 --> 02:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2599
02:01:09.491 --> 02:01:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I understand that pragmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2600
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but we all have to weigh in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some form or another.</v>

2601
02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And they failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They failed,</v>

2602
02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:16.930
<v Speaker 2>they failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They failed.</v>

2603
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took a big blow to the Charlie Hebdo.</v>

2604
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the kicker.</v>

2605
02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.650
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about Chutzpah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2606
02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2607
02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of,</v>

2608
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the sort of Islamic organizations</v>

2609
02:01:31.091 --> 02:01:36.091
<v Speaker 2>in the US gave an Islamophobia award to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the slain Charlie Hebdo folks.</v>

2610
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 3>So not only the dose people die for </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing cartoons,</v>

2611
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were smeared post mortem.</v>

2612
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2613
02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a level of diabolical grotesqueness</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unimaginable,</v>

2614
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:56.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean let,</v>

2615
02:01:56.630 --> 02:01:58.380
<v Speaker 3>let them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in piece,</v>

2616
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:04.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a real big battle of ideas </v>

2617
02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:05.120
<v Speaker 3>and we all have to weigh in on it</v>

2618
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think that there's a lot of folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that do not want to die like that and </v>

2619
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:14.131
<v Speaker 1>they also don't want to be confused with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those folks that were drawing these </v>

2620
02:02:14.131 --> 02:02:18.781
<v Speaker 1>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be lumped in in any </v>

2621
02:02:18.781 --> 02:02:18.781
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

2622
02:02:18.781 --> 02:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So they will come out against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah,</v>

2623
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck in very strong fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will let everyone know that they </v>

2624
02:02:25.811 --> 02:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>are not on that team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2625
02:02:27.490 --> 02:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>they do think it's racist without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration whatsoever for the,</v>

2626
02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overall effect of those words of,</v>

2627
02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>of calling something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobic or what is Islamophobic?</v>

2628
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:44.590
<v Speaker 1>What you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fear of an ideology that is so rigid,</v>

2629
02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>they'll kill you for a cartoon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't scare you.</v>

2630
02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>You're not phobic of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>

2631
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>

2632
02:02:53.590 --> 02:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>it should be whatever the fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as it comes down to killing </v>

2633
02:02:58.590 --> 02:03:01.831
<v Speaker 1>people over cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a very weird problem on our </v>

2634
02:03:01.831 --> 02:03:01.831
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2635
02:03:01.831 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 1>And when we're dealing with an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk of the western world that thinks </v>

2636
02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:06.690
<v Speaker 1>that that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2637
02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be overlooked,</v>

2638
02:03:08.471 --> 02:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but you can shit all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians are shit all over.</v>

2639
02:03:11.141 --> 02:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Mormons are shit all over anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's safe and it's okay.</v>

2640
02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>book of Mormons,</v>

2641
02:03:16.031 --> 02:03:17.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the play.</v>

2642
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2643
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:23.350
<v Speaker 3>people pay money to go and watch actors </v>
<v Speaker 3>making fun openly about her religion.</v>

2644
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Try to do that with one particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>

2645
02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Try to do the book of Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2646
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Try that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2647
02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.640
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've heard the term </v>

2648
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.931
<v Speaker 3>bigotry of lowered expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there are different versions of </v>

2649
02:03:37.931 --> 02:03:38.210
<v Speaker 3>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of softened expectations?</v>

2650
02:03:38.250 --> 02:03:43.250
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that somehow Islam should </v>
<v Speaker 3>not be held to the same standard as </v>

2651
02:03:45.321 --> 02:03:48.260
<v Speaker 3>every other ideology because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go crazy what?</v>

2652
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 3>That that itself is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2653
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2654
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:56.170
<v Speaker 3>So when I gave you earlier the example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Iraqi scientists who said that </v>

2655
02:03:56.170 --> 02:03:56.410
<v Speaker 3>the earth is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2656
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:57.650
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lady writes to me,</v>

2657
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you criticizing this guy?</v>

2658
02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.670
<v Speaker 3>She's actually racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2659
02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Because she's saying that somehow this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy doesn't have the capacity to be </v>

2660
02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.931
<v Speaker 3>criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when I criticize the rabbi that </v>

2661
02:04:10.931 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I went to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a true story.</v>

2662
02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I was invited to a rabbi's House for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shabbat Dinner,</v>

2663
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.600
<v Speaker 3>Sabbath dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as I entered the house,</v>

2664
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:19.100
<v Speaker 3>he introduces me to everybody and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2665
02:04:19.101 --> 02:04:20.350
<v Speaker 3>this a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a professor,</v>

2666
02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:20.630
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2667
02:04:20.631 --> 02:04:21.860
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He studies evolution,</v>

2668
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:24.470
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows that evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been falsified.</v>

2669
02:04:24.471 --> 02:04:26.180
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure what he studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2670
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2671
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:31.280
<v Speaker 3>that guy was being an idiot right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come when I criticize this rabbi,</v>

2672
02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:35.690
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly fair game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come when I criticize the Republican</v>

2673
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 3>senator who denies evolution because</v>

2674
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>of his Christian faith?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a young earth creationist,</v>

2675
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:45.890
<v Speaker 2>that's perfectly fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I criticize the Iraquis </v>

2676
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 2>astronomer because he believes that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth is flat,</v>

2677
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2678
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:53.540
<v Speaker 2>it's human folly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know exactly what it is.</v>

2679
02:04:53.541 --> 02:04:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

2680
02:04:53.961 --> 02:04:58.961
<v Speaker 2>We're in a very weird predicament with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one very large segment of our </v>

2681
02:04:59.071 --> 02:05:01.080
<v Speaker 2>population on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2682
02:05:01.090 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One point six,</v>

2683
02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:06.420
<v Speaker 2>one point six point six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a large chunk.</v>

2684
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>

2685
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Now Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2686
02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:12.840
<v Speaker 2>do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you see the trajectories of Alpha</v>

2687
02:05:12.841 --> 02:05:17.841
<v Speaker 2>brand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see this ever the pendulum </v>

2688
02:05:17.841 --> 02:05:17.841
<v Speaker 2>swinging the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you,</v>

2689
02:05:17.841 --> 02:05:22.670
<v Speaker 2>what do you think would be the catalyst </v>
<v Speaker 2>to redress some of this ground folly at </v>

2690
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.760
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic drugs for real thing that's </v>

2691
02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.220
<v Speaker 2>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to talk to the real God.</v>

2692
02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Have a real conversation with homeboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2693
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to get to him is </v>

2694
02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:37.130
<v Speaker 2>through psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the best way.</v>

2695
02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets your rice,</v>

2696
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>almond atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've never taken a psychiatric </v>

2697
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics.</v>

2698
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the kind of thing you never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

2699
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:48.210
<v Speaker 2>here's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never taken any drugs.</v>

2700
02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I've never smoked a single cigarette in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

2701
02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>

2702
02:05:51.331 --> 02:05:53.520
<v Speaker 2>what about you get drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

2703
02:05:53.521 --> 02:05:55.740
<v Speaker 2>very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

2704
02:05:55.741 --> 02:06:00.741
<v Speaker 2>the first time I ever drank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a very competitive soccer </v>

2705
02:06:00.741 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was maybe 22.</v>

2706
02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I had very long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very proud of my son Sonia and hair.</v>

2707
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:08.370
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of soccer players on my team </v>
<v Speaker 2>held me down,</v>

2708
02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>brought scissors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out your hair and they said you </v>

2709
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 2>either drink today or the hairs off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time I ever drank.</v>

2710
02:06:16.210 --> 02:06:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I must've been 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22.</v>

2711
02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my only vice has been maybe my a </v>

2712
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.570
<v Speaker 2>dietary choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still drink occasionally.</v>

2713
02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a drug,</v>

2714
02:06:25.921 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how can you say you don't do drugs?</v>

2715
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:32.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't come on.</v>

2716
02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:37.461
<v Speaker 2>That's just as as much of a blinder is </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is the idea that you don't </v>

2717
02:06:37.461 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 2>perturb your consciousness through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very distinct method.</v>

2718
02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a glass of wine and get fucked </v>

2719
02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You throw them back,</v>

2720
02:06:46.111 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you get crazy smashed glasses inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimney.</v>

2721
02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:54.530
<v Speaker 2>If my wife is watching right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she does have a photo of me drunk on a </v>

2722
02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:57.000
<v Speaker 2>absence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2723
02:06:57.001 --> 02:07:02.001
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at Club Med and I had drank too </v>

2724
02:07:02.001 --> 02:07:04.590
<v Speaker 2>much and I'm totally sloshed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that photo exists somewhere,</v>

2725
02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:08.260
<v Speaker 2>so maybe she'll just club med.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe this bastard,</v>

2726
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2727
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:10.530
<v Speaker 2>To her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she'll release it on twitter.</v>

2728
02:07:11.730 --> 02:07:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2729
02:07:12.690 --> 02:07:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I think there's certain psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that could help people,</v>

2730
02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:21.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alter their perceptions of this world </v>

2731
02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:21.140
<v Speaker 2>and give you a reset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they do.</v>

2732
02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is a very long conversation that</v>

2733
02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:29.121
<v Speaker 2>I've had many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times on this podcast and we could </v>

2734
02:07:29.121 --> 02:07:30.120
<v Speaker 2>have it some other time maybe if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to off air or whatever,</v>

2735
02:07:30.121 --> 02:07:35.121
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are psychedelic drugs that are </v>

2736
02:07:35.121 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>most likely the of all religious</v>

2737
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2738
02:07:37.421 --> 02:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a scholar out of Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty famous guy.</v>

2739
02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I forget the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he's essentially saying is that</v>

2740
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:50.731
<v Speaker 1>the burning Bush that Moses described </v>
<v Speaker 1>was most likely the acacia tree or the </v>

2741
02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Acacia Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very rich dimethyltryptamine,</v>

2742
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>which is the most potent psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug known to man.</v>

2743
02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And I've experienced this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug and this particular drug gives you </v>

2744
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:07.651
<v Speaker 1>a very intense feeling of joining with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother,</v>

2745
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>with communicating with God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2746
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with getting in contact with some </v>

2747
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:17.710
<v Speaker 1>intelligent power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some intelligent mind,</v>

2748
02:08:17.711 --> 02:08:22.711
<v Speaker 1>something that is above and beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in our normal dimension that we </v>

2749
02:08:24.041 --> 02:08:29.041
<v Speaker 1>exist in and it's filled with complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometric patterns and communicate with </v>

2750
02:08:29.351 --> 02:08:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you telepathically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very,</v>

2751
02:08:31.811 --> 02:08:36.811
<v Speaker 1>very crazy experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that happens in </v>

2752
02:08:36.811 --> 02:08:40.741
<v Speaker 1>these dmt trips is that they give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like lessons of how to live life.</v>

2753
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And the lessons all seem to row there.</v>

2754
02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You never have like these psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dmt trip.</v>

2755
02:08:47.271 --> 02:08:52.271
<v Speaker 1>So they tell you what you need to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape more and beat the fuck out of </v>

2756
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:52.300
<v Speaker 1>people and steal as much shit as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2757
02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's more like love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like love people.</v>

2758
02:08:55.781 --> 02:08:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love the love yourself,</v>

2759
02:08:58.001 --> 02:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>love everyone around you because don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about all the bullshit,</v>

2760
02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>just being nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have fun.</v>

2761
02:09:03.641 --> 02:09:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Just enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spread it and don't lie.</v>

2762
02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't deceive,</v>

2763
02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:12.610
<v Speaker 1>don't deceive yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't deceive anyone else and don't,</v>

2764
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>don't lose perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be here and then you're </v>

2765
02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:20.791
<v Speaker 1>going to be there and you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and you're going to be there and </v>

2766
02:09:20.791 --> 02:09:22.240
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this perpetual cycle that continues</v>

2767
02:09:22.241 --> 02:09:27.241
<v Speaker 1>from birth to death through infinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant testimony.</v>

2768
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Part of an endless cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the experience in a </v>

2769
02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>nutshell.</v>

2770
02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>This is what you get out of it and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the idea that you would come </v>

2771
02:09:37.391 --> 02:09:39.700
<v Speaker 1>out of this experience with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenants,</v>

2772
02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:42.520
<v Speaker 1>set of rules like most this commandment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2773
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense that Moses could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be this guy who was into smoking dmt and</v>

2774
02:09:48.071 --> 02:09:48.880
<v Speaker 1>telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2775
02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:53.881
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having all these sword fights and </v>

2776
02:09:53.881 --> 02:09:56.010
<v Speaker 1>shooting arrows at each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning our neighbors threats from a </v>

2777
02:09:56.010 --> 02:09:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Jewish extremists though I doubt it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this guy in Israel,</v>

2778
02:09:58.810 --> 02:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I know you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy in Israel Sivia find a and </v>

2779
02:10:03.810 --> 02:10:07.190
<v Speaker 1>find that article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a pretty interesting paper </v>

2780
02:10:07.190 --> 02:10:07.190
<v Speaker 1>because this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:10:07.190 --> 02:10:09.970
<v Speaker 1>a real academic who is basing this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of research.</v>

2782
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it the case that many religious </v>

2783
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:18.151
<v Speaker 1>rituals of various cultures engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these types of consumer authority </v>

2784
02:10:18.151 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 1>behaviors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We absolutely,</v>

2785
02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 1>as part of their religious rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct wasn't matter of fact,</v>

2786
02:10:21.821 --> 02:10:25.000
<v Speaker 1>John Marco Allegro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is one of the main,</v>

2787
02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars that was assigned to decipher </v>

2788
02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:30.490
<v Speaker 1>the Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the oldest version of the Bible</v>

2789
02:10:30.491 --> 02:10:31.120
<v Speaker 1>known right.</v>

2790
02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I the only version in Aramaic,</v>

2791
02:10:35.301 --> 02:10:40.301
<v Speaker 1>it was found in these clay pots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qumran in 1940 something.</v>

2792
02:10:41.241 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It took forever for them to decipher </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2793
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:48.491
<v Speaker 1>And this Guy John Marco Allegro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on them for 14 plus years and he </v>

2794
02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>was the only agnostic on the committee </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was assigned to decipher it.</v>

2795
02:10:53.151 --> 02:10:58.151
<v Speaker 1>He was originally an ordained minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over time he became disenchanted </v>

2796
02:10:58.611 --> 02:11:03.611
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of religion when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found all these contradictions and </v>

2797
02:11:03.611 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 1>religion and these comparisons to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts.</v>

2798
02:11:04.461 --> 02:11:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And he realized that a lot of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably bullshit.</v>

2799
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And so he wrote a book called the sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom and the cross.</v>

2800
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And after 14 years of deciphering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

2801
02:11:14.271 --> 02:11:19.271
<v Speaker 1>it was his interpretation that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire Christian religion was a massive </v>

2802
02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:22.811
<v Speaker 1>misunderstanding that what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally about was the consumption of </v>

2803
02:11:22.811 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms and fertility </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>

2804
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it was a fertility cult because</v>

2805
02:11:27.381 --> 02:11:28.580
<v Speaker 1>back then it was all about.</v>

2806
02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:33.580
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about get pregnant because </v>

2807
02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:37.030
<v Speaker 1>there's not many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need more and the Romans might </v>

2808
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.030
<v Speaker 1>becoming and in my fucking kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

2809
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:41.951
<v Speaker 1>women need warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need a large group of us </v>

2810
02:11:41.951 --> 02:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and we can't let them know about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

2811
02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And he even traced the Etymology of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word </v>

2812
02:11:49.881 --> 02:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>that meant a mushroom covered in God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>semen and what,</v>

2813
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:55.670
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they thought was,</v>

2814
02:11:55.671 --> 02:12:00.671
<v Speaker 1>according to John Marco Allegro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they thought was that when it </v>

2815
02:12:00.671 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 1>rained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was god coming on the world,</v>

2816
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like a cosmic cosmic money shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that these mushrooms would grow out </v>

2817
02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:10.820
<v Speaker 1>of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2818
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is when you have a rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go outside in the morning,</v>

2819
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you see mushrooms that are already </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown,</v>

2820
02:12:15.381 --> 02:12:17.480
<v Speaker 1>like they weren't even there last night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're there.</v>

2821
02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:22.660
<v Speaker 1>They grow so quickly and then you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>find these and they would eat these and </v>

2822
02:12:22.671 --> 02:12:25.940
<v Speaker 1>have these intense psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of course.</v>

2823
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2824
02:12:28.911 --> 02:12:29.330
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

2825
02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So we'll leave it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave it up so that these people that </v>

2826
02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:39.131
<v Speaker 1>would experience these would have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense transformative trips and without</v>

2827
02:12:39.651 --> 02:12:44.651
<v Speaker 1>any science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any knowledge of what the </v>

2828
02:12:44.651 --> 02:12:46.661
<v Speaker 1>components of these mushrooms are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very similar by the way to </v>

2829
02:12:46.661 --> 02:12:50.451
<v Speaker 1>human neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT is nn dimethyltryptamine and that </v>

2830
02:12:50.571 --> 02:12:55.571
<v Speaker 1>exists in the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's produced by the liver and the </v>

2831
02:12:55.571 --> 02:12:58.841
<v Speaker 1>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have now have proven due to </v>

2832
02:12:58.841 --> 02:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rick strassman's work.</v>

2833
02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:01.670
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this great book called Dmt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit molecule.</v>

2834
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.830
<v Speaker 1>He's a professor at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico and Got Dea approved clinical</v>

2835
02:13:06.831 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>track tests on subjects using dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2836
02:13:10.041 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cottonwood research foundation that</v>

2837
02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:16.811
<v Speaker 1>he helped start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has proven that it's produced in the </v>

2838
02:13:16.811 --> 02:13:17.990
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland of live rats and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2839
02:13:17.991 --> 02:13:22.991
<v Speaker 1>The pineal gland is the third eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in reptile that actually has let a </v>

2840
02:13:22.991 --> 02:13:23.990
<v Speaker 1>retina and the Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2841
02:13:23.991 --> 02:13:28.991
<v Speaker 1>it literally is in the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain where the third eye is in eastern </v>

2842
02:13:28.991 --> 02:13:32.951
<v Speaker 1>mysticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's producing this intense psychedelic </v>

2843
02:13:32.951 --> 02:13:32.951
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

2844
02:13:32.951 --> 02:13:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's what this Hebrew University </v>
<v Speaker 2>researcher Moses was tripping at Mount </v>

2845
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Sinai is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2846
02:13:38.071 --> 02:13:43.071
<v Speaker 2>is he high?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they'll know this literature </v>

2847
02:13:43.071 --> 02:13:43.820
<v Speaker 2>is he viewed it as a sort of outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quack.</v>

2848
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You would have to research it and find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out more about it because I did a </v>

2849
02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>cursory examination because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar with the drug and it only makes</v>

2850
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:52.320
<v Speaker 2>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2851
02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2852
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:56.600
<v Speaker 2>he visited the Amazon and drink Iowasca </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2853
02:13:56.730 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 2>he has this idea of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what this was probably all about</v>

2854
02:14:00.631 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 2>because Iowasca has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe it's very difficult to find</v>

2855
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 2>out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

2856
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:11.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amazonian indigenous people were </v>

2857
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:14.451
<v Speaker 2>drinking this brew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But IOWASCA is a form of DMT and much </v>

2858
02:14:14.451 --> 02:14:17.700
<v Speaker 2>like the acacia bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rich and dmt thousands of plants or</v>

2859
02:14:17.701 --> 02:14:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Richmond Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT,</v>

2860
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.310
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance.</v>

2861
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they're doing with this Iowasca</v>

2862
02:14:23.101 --> 02:14:27.150
<v Speaker 2>is an orally active version of dmt </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it has,</v>

2863
02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:30.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has one plant that has dmt in another</v>

2864
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:34.410
<v Speaker 2>plant that has something called an Mao </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitor because dmt is broken down the</v>

2865
02:14:34.411 --> 02:14:36.660
<v Speaker 2>gut by something called Mano Amy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not oxidase.</v>

2866
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Gino.</v>

2867
02:14:39.061 --> 02:14:42.720
<v Speaker 2>This ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the Amazonian tribes.</v>

2868
02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I discussed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my books with the bullet ants.</v>

2869
02:14:45.211 --> 02:14:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2870
02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for mean just mentioned briefly </v>

2871
02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.111
<v Speaker 2>for your viewers who might not know it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think they drink some </v>

2872
02:14:54.111 --> 02:14:54.111
<v Speaker 2>psychotropic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2873
02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be a tumor or </v>

2874
02:14:59.220 --> 02:14:59.220
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those.</v>

2875
02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs that they take down </v>

2876
02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently.</v>

2877
02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.680
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically have to.</v>

2878
02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:06.900
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sedate these bullets pants.</v>

2879
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:09.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they were these smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2880
02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Which spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they wear these gloves were </v>

2881
02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:18.051
<v Speaker 2>they then sort of weave the ants into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the glove as the ants come out of their </v>

2882
02:15:18.901 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 2>stupor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start biting the wearer.</v>

2883
02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one bite from that ad,</v>

2884
02:15:26.021 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's called bullet pad because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pain is greater than if you were hit</v>

2885
02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 2>by a bullet.</v>

2886
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2887
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:37.190
<v Speaker 2>pain and do same thing in nature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do it 20 times on different</v>

2888
02:15:40.741 --> 02:15:43.680
<v Speaker 2>occasions before there's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted into manhood or whatever,</v>

2889
02:15:43.681 --> 02:15:45.120
<v Speaker 2>the gds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2890
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2891
02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.800
<v Speaker 2>the point that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the link to your story is that I think </v>

2892
02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:51.310
<v Speaker 2>they're under some psychotropics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2893
02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

2894
02:15:52.671 --> 02:15:57.671
<v Speaker 2>Those admits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve was bitten by a bullet </v>

2895
02:15:57.671 --> 02:15:57.671
<v Speaker 2>ant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2896
02:15:57.671 --> 02:15:57.671
<v Speaker 2>Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2897
02:15:57.671 --> 02:15:59.250
<v Speaker 2>He got bitten on his heel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it was unbelievably painful.</v>

2898
02:15:59.251 --> 02:16:01.710
<v Speaker 2>They said it lasted for hours too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2899
02:16:01.711 --> 02:16:03.510
<v Speaker 2>but he said when it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really weird.</v>

2900
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 2>It was so painful that he was delusional</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he couldn't even remember which </v>

2901
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:11.991
<v Speaker 2>he'll got bit crafter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was over because once it subsided it </v>

2902
02:16:11.991 --> 02:16:15.510
<v Speaker 2>was like he like woke up from a transfer</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit and he said it was really,</v>

2903
02:16:15.511 --> 02:16:20.511
<v Speaker 2>really painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really difficult to concentrate </v>

2904
02:16:20.511 --> 02:16:20.700
<v Speaker 2>on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This slightly less spiritual.</v>

2905
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Can we segue from the money shots to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual study on money shots on sperm?</v>

2906
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2907
02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 2>and I at the reason why I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2908
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.110
<v Speaker 2>because I know that in your own</v>

2909
02:16:30.150 --> 02:16:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Scada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking one track mind because I know </v>

2910
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:38.481
<v Speaker 3>that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for inviting me to </v>

2911
02:16:38.481 --> 02:16:39.520
<v Speaker 3>your show in Montreal and to the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>

2912
02:16:39.521 --> 02:16:40.990
<v Speaker 3>That was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you had a good time.</v>

2913
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:43.720
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was at your show with my wife,</v>

2914
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I think you had a little bit on sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what it was.</v>

2915
02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I might've sent you a direct </v>

2917
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 3>message that kind of spoke to some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the issues that you raised.</v>

2918
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:58.800
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about the science of sperm </v>

2919
02:16:58.800 --> 02:16:58.920
<v Speaker 3>and porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get ready.</v>

2920
02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was a study done a few years ago</v>

2921
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:07.801
<v Speaker 3>by some colleagues of mine where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to look at the content of porno </v>

2922
02:17:08.381 --> 02:17:13.381
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you think of the typical male </v>

2923
02:17:13.381 --> 02:17:13.690
<v Speaker 3>fantasy at men who wants to have sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>with many women,</v>

2924
02:17:13.691 --> 02:17:13.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2925
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:17.800
<v Speaker 3>So most societies are polygynous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning one man with multiple women,</v>

2926
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:19.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should be.</v>

2927
02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:21.970
<v Speaker 3>God dammit to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most societies,</v>

2928
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:24.010
<v Speaker 3>most societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>85 percent of societies,</v>

2929
02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:27.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have historically condoned polygyny.</v>

2930
02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck.</v>

2931
02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:30.250
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wrongly say polygamy.</v>

2932
02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Polygamy just means one with many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But polygyny is one man with many women.</v>

2933
02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Polyandry is one woman with many men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2934
02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:42.140
<v Speaker 3>so stay with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horseshit.</v>

2935
02:17:43.670 --> 02:17:44.470
<v Speaker 3>They are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

2936
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 3>There are very few societies that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2937
02:17:47.770 --> 02:17:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I've been telling everybody that's Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of paternity uncertainty about,</v>

2938
02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:51.490
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2939
02:17:51.491 --> 02:17:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it goes.</v>

2940
02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:55.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so polygyny is what men want.</v>

2941
02:17:55.390 --> 02:17:56.590
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

2942
02:17:56.591 --> 02:17:58.300
<v Speaker 3>heroin building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one man with many women.</v>

2943
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do a content analysis of porn </v>

2944
02:18:03.510 --> 02:18:06.001
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you find that that study has been </v>

2945
02:18:06.001 --> 02:18:07.570
<v Speaker 3>done by a guy by the name athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas Pound,</v>

2946
02:18:07.930 --> 02:18:10.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2947
02:18:10.890 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a shout out to this guy.</v>

2948
02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:17.040
<v Speaker 3>He owes me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did a content analysis where he </v>

2949
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 3>showed that polyandrous depictions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more common and porn movies,</v>

2950
02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:24.280
<v Speaker 3>meaning one woman with multiple men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2951
02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these.</v>

2952
02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And he argued basically that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that is because it's,</v>

2953
02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:32.230
<v Speaker 3>it's an excitatory q for sperm </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

2954
02:18:32.590 --> 02:18:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So watch this now.</v>

2955
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then these other researchers came </v>

2956
02:18:39.730 --> 02:18:39.730
<v Speaker 3>along and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2957
02:18:39.730 --> 02:18:40.590
<v Speaker 3>how could we test this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they did is basically they,</v>

2958
02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:45.760
<v Speaker 3>they asked men to take one of two images</v>
<v Speaker 3>home either with women having sex or one</v>

2959
02:18:47.801 --> 02:18:49.660
<v Speaker 3>woman with multiple guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polyandry,</v>

2960
02:18:50.290 --> 02:18:55.290
<v Speaker 3>and then masturbate to those images and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then bring back their sperm to the lab </v>

2961
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:58.390
<v Speaker 3>to be evaluated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or as I like to say,</v>

2962
02:18:58.391 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 3>the fruits of their manual labor and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guests.</v>

2963
02:19:01.991 --> 02:19:06.991
<v Speaker 3>What they found that the sperm that </v>
<v Speaker 3>originated from the masturbations to </v>

2964
02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:12.130
<v Speaker 3>polyandrous images were much more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had greater motility.</v>

2965
02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:13.720
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were more vigorous,</v>

2966
02:19:13.721 --> 02:19:17.710
<v Speaker 3>they moved a lot more which supported </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of sperm competition,</v>

2967
02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:23.010
<v Speaker 3>and this is exactly what you get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal husbandry right when you want </v>

2968
02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:26.100
<v Speaker 3>your stud to be riled up to have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you often will show another male having </v>

2969
02:19:27.591 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 3>sex with a female and then this will get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rise out of him.</v>

2970
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So this explains the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

2971
02:19:32.721 --> 02:19:37.721
<v Speaker 3>the disconnect between how come men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>so desirous to have sex with many women </v>

2972
02:19:37.721 --> 02:19:42.490
<v Speaker 3>at once and yet you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's what you would think </v>

2973
02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:42.490
<v Speaker 3>would be the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That informal reason,</v>

2974
02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 3>that's not what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a lot more of two,</v>

2975
02:19:44.151 --> 02:19:49.151
<v Speaker 3>three guys on one woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now I have elucidated the mysteries </v>

2976
02:19:49.151 --> 02:19:49.400
<v Speaker 3>of porn for you.</v>

2977
02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense on a biological level </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the more promiscuous the females</v>

2978
02:19:55.111 --> 02:19:56.370
<v Speaker 1>are around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2979
02:19:56.371 --> 02:19:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the larger their testicles are testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

2980
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The testicles grow and they produce more</v>

2981
02:20:02.581 --> 02:20:04.170
<v Speaker 1>sperm because of the competition.</v>

2982
02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.560
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>

2983
02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Let me jump on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look across primates at the </v>

2984
02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:15.181
<v Speaker 3>size of the testicle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the males of that species as a </v>

2985
02:20:15.181 --> 02:20:17.710
<v Speaker 3>function of female promiscuity and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>

2986
02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:20.770
<v Speaker 3>you see a perfect correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mountain gorillas,</v>

2987
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:22.720
<v Speaker 3>little tiny balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tiny Dick.</v>

2988
02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Very good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2989
02:20:23.771 --> 02:20:28.771
<v Speaker 3>They're usually impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have a complete sexual </v>

2990
02:20:28.771 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 3>territoriality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2991
02:20:28.791 --> 02:20:30.580
<v Speaker 3>they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They became too powerful.</v>

2992
02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Chimps on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive testicle.</v>

2993
02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:35.980
<v Speaker 3>They're walking testicles basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2994
02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Precisely because it's an adaptation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>female promiscuity.</v>

2995
02:20:39.401 --> 02:20:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Within that species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are closer to the chimp.</v>

2996
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>End of the scale for care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are now speaking about the thought </v>

2997
02:20:48.370 --> 02:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2998
02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:53.460
<v Speaker 3>And all this bs stuff that you see on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses when I describe those </v>

2999
02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:57.961
<v Speaker 3>particular studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feminists and the crowd will be </v>

3000
02:20:57.961 --> 02:21:01.380
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very pleased because then I'm </v>

3001
02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:01.540
<v Speaker 3>demonstrating that women can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>promiscuous,</v>

3002
02:21:01.690 --> 02:21:03.610
<v Speaker 3>that fits the narrative of feminism.</v>

3003
02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:05.650
<v Speaker 3>If on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3004
02:21:05.651 --> 02:21:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I might five minutes later say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3005
02:21:07.811 --> 02:21:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3006
02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:15.420
<v Speaker 3>sexual variety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men have a slightly greater pension for </v>

3007
02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:17.770
<v Speaker 3>sexual variety than women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I suddenly become Dr Mengele,</v>

3008
02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.300
<v Speaker 3>the Nazi doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3009
02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:24.420
<v Speaker 3>so basically the evolutionary finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I discuss is either liberating to </v>

3010
02:21:26.321 --> 02:21:31.321
<v Speaker 3>the feminist if it fits with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative or it is a form of </v>

3011
02:21:31.321 --> 02:21:31.321
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

3012
02:21:31.321 --> 02:21:36.061
<v Speaker 3>bs if it doesn't fit bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that again is the problem with what </v>

3013
02:21:36.061 --> 02:21:36.061
<v Speaker 3>you see on campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3014
02:21:36.061 --> 02:21:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Rather than an open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>

3015
02:21:37.690 --> 02:21:40.780
<v Speaker 3>this course about the veracity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific findings,</v>

3016
02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:44.380
<v Speaker 3>we judge these findings as a function of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our pet ideology,</v>

3017
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:48.920
<v Speaker 1>the pet ideology when it comes to gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>identification and gender identities.</v>

3018
02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real interesting point to be </v>

3019
02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>made with that when it comes to science </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

3020
02:21:54.411 --> 02:21:59.411
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>being touted about is diversity in </v>

3021
02:21:59.411 --> 02:22:03.371
<v Speaker 1>science and gender diversity in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to what people </v>

3022
02:22:03.371 --> 02:22:05.690
<v Speaker 1>actually want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been studies.</v>

3023
02:22:05.691 --> 02:22:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You give a boy a certain toy or girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain toy,</v>

3024
02:22:08.661 --> 02:22:13.661
<v Speaker 1>they're going to gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are more in line with their </v>

3025
02:22:13.661 --> 02:22:14.960
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that fucks people up.</v>

3026
02:22:14.961 --> 02:22:19.961
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That some boys like trucks and some </v>

3027
02:22:19.961 --> 02:22:22.511
<v Speaker 1>girls like dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it should be is what do they </v>

3028
02:22:22.511 --> 02:22:23.420
<v Speaker 1>like and guess what if the girl likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>

3029
02:22:23.421 --> 02:22:25.890
<v Speaker 1>are the boys liked dolls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who a fuck,</v>

3030
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:30.000
<v Speaker 3>but let's let the data speak for itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to understand.</v>

3031
02:22:30.090 --> 02:22:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy you mentioned toy </v>
<v Speaker 3>preference because that's one of my </v>

3032
02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:37.161
<v Speaker 3>favorite examples to demonstrate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunacy of the whole social </v>

3033
02:22:37.161 --> 02:22:37.161
<v Speaker 3>constructivist stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>

3034
02:22:37.161 --> 02:22:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So usually in the social sciences or </v>

3035
02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:42.740
<v Speaker 3>certainly social constructive as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones who argue that everything is due to</v>

3036
02:22:42.741 --> 02:22:47.741
<v Speaker 3>stress litigation will use toy </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences as if you like the starting </v>

3037
02:22:47.741 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 3>point of how gender role socialization </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

3038
02:22:49.981 --> 02:22:54.981
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny is taught to play rough with the </v>

3039
02:22:54.981 --> 02:22:56.991
<v Speaker 3>GI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe then start to play nurturing with </v>

3040
02:22:56.991 --> 02:22:58.880
<v Speaker 3>the pink doll and that starts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cascade of arbitrary sexist,</v>

3041
02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:03.980
<v Speaker 3>gender role socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I decided that I wanted to take that </v>

3042
02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:04.980
<v Speaker 3>premise on and I wanted to bring data </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a very,</v>

3043
02:23:04.981 --> 02:23:08.490
<v Speaker 3>very broad range of fields to completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>dismantled this bullshit.</v>

3044
02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>

3045
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:15.050
<v Speaker 3>So if you take children who are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pre socialization stage of their </v>

3046
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:19.761
<v Speaker 3>cognitive development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they don't yet have the </v>

3047
02:23:19.761 --> 02:23:19.860
<v Speaker 3>capacity to be socialized and you give </v>
<v Speaker 3>them tests,</v>

3048
02:23:19.861 --> 02:23:21.060
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of eye gazing,</v>

3049
02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:25.800
<v Speaker 3>they could either stare at adults or </v>
<v Speaker 3>trucks or play with dolls or trucks.</v>

3050
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you already see the sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>specificity,</v>

3051
02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:33.200
<v Speaker 3>other toy preferences and the priests </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialization stage of their cognitive </v>

3052
02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.621
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning they couldn't have been </v>

3053
02:23:36.621 --> 02:23:36.621
<v Speaker 3>socialized into those preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep going.</v>

3054
02:23:36.621 --> 02:23:40.850
<v Speaker 3>If you take other species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take vervet monkeys and rhesus </v>

3055
02:23:40.850 --> 02:23:42.180
<v Speaker 3>monkeys and you take infants of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

3056
02:23:42.330 --> 02:23:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It replicates the sex specificity of toy</v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences of human infants.</v>

3057
02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Let's go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take,</v>

3058
02:23:48.930 --> 02:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>if you take a little girls who suffer </v>
<v Speaker 3>from something called an </v>

3059
02:23:53.930 --> 02:23:57.210
<v Speaker 3>endocrinological disorder called </v>
<v Speaker 3>congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</v>

3060
02:23:57.870 --> 02:24:02.870
<v Speaker 3>This is a disorder that masculinize as </v>
<v Speaker 3>little girls and masculinize as their </v>

3061
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.870
<v Speaker 3>morphology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

3062
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.870
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

3063
02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:08.090
<v Speaker 3>their physical traits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also masculinized as their </v>

3064
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:10.971
<v Speaker 3>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what happens to their toy </v>

3065
02:24:10.971 --> 02:24:13.101
<v Speaker 3>preferences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become more like little boy if you </v>

3066
02:24:13.101 --> 02:24:13.980
<v Speaker 3>take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Sweden,</v>

3067
02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:15.220
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3068
02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 3>the most gender neutral country in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3069
02:24:18.451 --> 02:24:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Actually it's been studied as an iphone.</v>

3070
02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender neutral household.</v>

3071
02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically what happens in Sweden is that</v>

3072
02:24:24.661 --> 02:24:29.661
<v Speaker 3>the government has systematically tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to completely eradicate as a big social </v>

3073
02:24:29.661 --> 02:24:32.040
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any gender markers,</v>

3074
02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:36.590
<v Speaker 3>you remove the gender pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender Pronoun,</v>

3075
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:38.400
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gendered pronouns.</v>

3076
02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:41.340
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3077
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:42.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't speak Swedish,</v>

3078
02:24:42.901 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I hear and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a scale that that's developed by</v>

3079
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:51.441
<v Speaker 3>a gentleman called hoffstead where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he ranks the countries from around</v>

3080
02:24:51.931 --> 02:24:56.931
<v Speaker 3>the world on this gender score and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweden is off the chart on it's </v>

3081
02:24:56.931 --> 02:24:57.690
<v Speaker 3>femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3082
02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:02.160
<v Speaker 3>It's just outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you now go to that country and</v>

3083
02:25:02.161 --> 02:25:04.350
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a perfect field experiment,</v>

3084
02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:06.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they've spent 40 years trying to</v>

3085
02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:11.780
<v Speaker 3>eradicate arbitrary sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender stereotypes and therefore you </v>

3086
02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:16.671
<v Speaker 3>should see that maybe the toy </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences would now be no longer like </v>

3087
02:25:16.671 --> 02:25:17.670
<v Speaker 3>everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what you find in those countries,</v>

3088
02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:22.730
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same as anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to 3000 years ago to funerary </v>

3089
02:25:23.891 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>ice</v>

3090
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:29.110
<v Speaker 2>icon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear near funerary monuments where </v>

3091
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:31.740
<v Speaker 2>little children are depicted in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece and you and you study how the </v>

3092
02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:36.211
<v Speaker 2>children are depicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little boys are shown with wheels </v>

3093
02:25:36.211 --> 02:25:36.670
<v Speaker 2>and trucks and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little on our trucks,</v>

3094
02:25:36.671 --> 02:25:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but the wheelbarrow stuff and the girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>are shown with dolls.</v>

3095
02:25:40.270 --> 02:25:43.750
<v Speaker 2>You could study cultures in various </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of Africa.</v>

3096
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Indigenous cultures as has been done by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a French anthropologist and the exact </v>

3097
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:53.341
<v Speaker 2>same behaviors manifest themselves so </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that just shows you how long we've </v>

3098
02:25:53.341 --> 02:25:56.020
<v Speaker 2>been under the oppressive thumb of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical.</v>

3099
02:25:56.050 --> 02:25:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3100
02:25:57.731 --> 02:26:02.731
<v Speaker 2>She archi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact mass media has been around even </v>

3101
02:26:02.731 --> 02:26:05.611
<v Speaker 2>before then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we explain this written and </v>

3102
02:26:05.611 --> 02:26:05.611
<v Speaker 2>clay tablets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were bullshitting even back then.</v>

3103
02:26:05.611 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Men are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

3104
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>This this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the to the to the digit </v>

3105
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>ratio is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with that?</v>

3106
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3107
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Please explain so that the two D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four d is the is the length of the ratio</v>

3108
02:26:16.001 --> 02:26:20.200
<v Speaker 2>of your index finger to your ring finger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at as a sexually dimorphic trait,</v>

3109
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:25.230
<v Speaker 2>meaning that men have much longer ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers than than index fingers.</v>

3110
02:26:25.811 --> 02:26:30.811
<v Speaker 2>Whereas women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two fingers are roughly the same </v>

3111
02:26:30.811 --> 02:26:33.661
<v Speaker 2>length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this important to this </v>

3112
02:26:33.661 --> 02:26:35.071
<v Speaker 2>discussion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that morphological feature is </v>

3113
02:26:35.071 --> 02:26:38.461
<v Speaker 2>actually shaped in Utero as a function </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how much testosterone you've been </v>

3114
02:26:38.461 --> 02:26:39.820
<v Speaker 2>exposed to in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3115
02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what some researchers have done is </v>

3116
02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:47.851
<v Speaker 2>they've looked at the digit ratio of </v>
<v Speaker 2>little boys and then link that to their </v>

3117
02:26:49.421 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 2>play pattern behaviors and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you find?</v>

3118
02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Little boys will have more masculinized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ratios have more masculinized toy </v>

3119
02:26:58.271 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 2>preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing has been done by the way with</v>

3120
02:27:00.851 --> 02:27:05.851
<v Speaker 2>actually circulating testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take seven day old children and </v>

3121
02:27:05.851 --> 02:27:10.261
<v Speaker 2>until the six months old you measure </v>
<v Speaker 2>their testosterone and testosterone </v>

3122
02:27:10.261 --> 02:27:12.130
<v Speaker 2>level predicts toy preferences.</v>

3123
02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:17.490
<v Speaker 2>So look how many different disparate </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of evidence I've just come up with</v>

3124
02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:21.820
<v Speaker 2>to demonstrate that it is not due to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary,</v>

3125
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:23.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist socialization.</v>

3126
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's very uncomfortable for me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to ignore that and put this </v>

3127
02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.371
<v Speaker 2>all on cultural ideas and stereotypes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people subscribe to because they </v>

3128
02:27:33.521 --> 02:27:36.220
<v Speaker 2>don't want their child to be ostracized </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the community.</v>

3129
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.970
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3130
02:27:36.971 --> 02:27:38.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very uncomfortable for me.</v>

3131
02:27:38.411 --> 02:27:43.411
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it drives me nuts because I think it </v>

3132
02:27:43.411 --> 02:27:45.451
<v Speaker 2>fucks people's heads up to us because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they feel like there's something </v>

3133
02:27:45.451 --> 02:27:45.520
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them for liking masculine </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3134
02:27:45.521 --> 02:27:50.521
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being masculine or liking masculine </v>

3135
02:27:50.521 --> 02:27:53.461
<v Speaker 2>thing seems less and less of a favorable</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit in 2015 and it's kind of I've </v>

3136
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:58.710
<v Speaker 2>ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like men get kind of shit on in </v>

3137
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:59.740
<v Speaker 2>this society because we get blamed for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things.</v>

3138
02:27:59.741 --> 02:28:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

3139
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying poor men and women </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think being a man is pretty </v>

3140
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:05.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it,</v>

3141
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just also don't think that we're </v>

3142
02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:10.620
<v Speaker 2>necessarily evil either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3143
02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some men do evil shit,</v>

3144
02:28:12.251 --> 02:28:17.251
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that men are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if boys like trucks or girls like </v>

3145
02:28:17.251 --> 02:28:22.231
<v Speaker 2>dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything wrong with </v>

3146
02:28:22.231 --> 02:28:22.231
<v Speaker 2>either one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is wrong.</v>

3147
02:28:22.231 --> 02:28:22.670
<v Speaker 2>We try to ascribe</v>

3148
02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:27.760
<v Speaker 1>or prescribe it when we try to put that </v>
<v Speaker 1>into some sort of an ideological box.</v>

3149
02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we dismiss it or we categorize it as</v>

3150
02:28:34.911 --> 02:28:39.911
<v Speaker 1>being a part of the problem is with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture when it's so clearly a natural </v>

3151
02:28:39.911 --> 02:28:39.911
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3152
02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3153
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it stands this lunacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not sure if we discussed it last</v>

3154
02:28:44.111 --> 02:28:49.111
<v Speaker 3>time I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this lunacy I think comes from a </v>

3155
02:28:49.111 --> 02:28:52.950
<v Speaker 3>good place in a idiotic place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the place it comes from the idea </v>

3156
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:57.270
<v Speaker 3>that if something is biological based,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's immutable and,</v>

3157
02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:58.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a scary thing,</v>

3158
02:28:58.901 --> 02:29:03.901
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people talk about biological </v>

3159
02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:03.901
<v Speaker 3>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is complete nonsense.</v>

3160
02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:07.000
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea of an brain being empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slate.</v>

3161
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:12.030
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's the biological determinism </v>

3162
02:29:12.030 --> 02:29:12.030
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>

3163
02:29:12.030 --> 02:29:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Because almost everything is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>inextricable mix of your biology and </v>

3164
02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:16.350
<v Speaker 3>environmental inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3165
02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:21.600
<v Speaker 3>almost nothing that you could think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't incorporate some environmental </v>

3166
02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:26.221
<v Speaker 3>input into whoever you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of it being completely </v>

3167
02:29:26.221 --> 02:29:26.221
<v Speaker 3>independent of any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3168
02:29:26.221 --> 02:29:31.170
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of nature versus nurture is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really a silly mood dichotomy because </v>

3169
02:29:31.170 --> 02:29:32.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a big broad spectrum of inputs.</v>

3170
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the example that I left the gift </v>

3171
02:29:37.950 --> 02:29:38.560
<v Speaker 3>to drive that point home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of your viewers might have heard me</v>

3172
02:29:38.561 --> 02:29:40.270
<v Speaker 3>say before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the cake metaphor.</v>

3173
02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:45.271
<v Speaker 3>So if you take a cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take all the ingredients of the </v>

3174
02:29:45.271 --> 02:29:45.271
<v Speaker 3>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

3175
02:29:45.271 --> 02:29:46.540
<v Speaker 3>here's the baking soda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's The flower,</v>

3176
02:29:46.541 --> 02:29:47.950
<v Speaker 3>here's the eggs here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar.</v>

3177
02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Once you Vegan cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you put it all together,</v>

3178
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:55.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're unable to then point,</v>

3179
02:29:55.781 --> 02:29:57.760
<v Speaker 3>once the cake is made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't point,</v>

3180
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 3>show me where the eggs are showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3181
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.720
<v Speaker 3>It's an x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an extra fuel mix.</v>

3182
02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:03.760
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea of nature versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>nurture.</v>

3183
02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're this big challenge with this cake.</v>

3184
02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3185
02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3186
02:30:08.730 --> 02:30:13.730
<v Speaker 3>so I think it comes from the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's biology is scary because it's </v>

3187
02:30:14.191 --> 02:30:17.350
<v Speaker 3>somehow doesn't carry with a degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

3188
02:30:17.610 --> 02:30:22.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if boys are supposed to be this and </v>

3189
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:24.811
<v Speaker 3>girls are supposed to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're doomed to those biological </v>

3190
02:30:24.811 --> 02:30:24.811
<v Speaker 3>imperatives.</v>

3191
02:30:24.811 --> 02:30:25.930
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

3192
02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:29.710
<v Speaker 3>All of these phenomena fall on a bell </v>
<v Speaker 3>curve,</v>

3193
02:30:29.711 --> 02:30:30.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3194
02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>some people are more this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are more that way,</v>

3195
02:30:33.461 --> 02:30:36.210
<v Speaker 3>so there's nothing really deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

3196
02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:38.770
<v Speaker 3>just another point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3197
02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:41.210
<v Speaker 3>men have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3198
02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:45.220
<v Speaker 3>evolved desire to seek status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the biological imperative because</v>

3199
02:30:45.221 --> 02:30:50.221
<v Speaker 3>women desire status and men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now the way Joe and Gad go about </v>

3200
02:30:50.530 --> 02:30:53.590
<v Speaker 3>instantiating that evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>imperative,</v>

3201
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:58.830
<v Speaker 3>it's completely different as a function </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their idiosyncratic talents that </v>

3202
02:30:58.830 --> 02:31:00.950
<v Speaker 3>shows you that it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that we,</v>

3203
02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:05.680
<v Speaker 3>we both have to become comics and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to gain status.</v>

3204
02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:10.740
<v Speaker 3>What is common to both of us is we both </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspire to ascend the social hierarchy.</v>

3205
02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:16.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the common biological imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How we go about it is completely </v>

3206
02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.350
<v Speaker 3>determined based on your unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>personhood.</v>

3207
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:19.770
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing deterministic about it.</v>

3208
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:25.550
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current climate where people want to </v>

3209
02:31:25.741 --> 02:31:30.741
<v Speaker 2>ignore all these biological markers like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about with children and</v>

3210
02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:35.500
<v Speaker 2>gravitating towards certain toys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone versus estrogen and babies.</v>

3211
02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:40.940
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that want to avoid these things but </v>

3212
02:31:40.940 --> 02:31:41.610
<v Speaker 2>ignore this data?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3213
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that it's very,</v>

3214
02:31:45.001 --> 02:31:47.120
<v Speaker 2>very hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3215
02:31:47.130 --> 02:31:52.130
<v Speaker 2>the narrative is very hopeful to assume </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we all start with equal </v>

3216
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 2>potentiality with APP that makes us </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely indistinguishable.</v>

3217
02:31:55.920 --> 02:32:00.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a very hopeful message because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically says that we are infinitely </v>

3218
02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:00.920
<v Speaker 2>malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3219
02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:02.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had joe had a different upbringing,</v>

3220
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe he would have been Michael Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3221
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3222
02:32:06.210 --> 02:32:11.210
<v Speaker 2>They are enabling a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying about how good a </v>

3223
02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:13.350
<v Speaker 2>basketball thing could be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are unique,</v>

3224
02:32:13.650 --> 02:32:18.650
<v Speaker 2>unique realities about the random </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of genes that made lionelle </v>

3225
02:32:18.650 --> 02:32:23.601
<v Speaker 2>messy that makes it such that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>withstanding the fact that he trains a </v>

3226
02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much harder than most other people.</v>

3227
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:30.590
<v Speaker 2>He is endowed with unique talents that </v>
<v Speaker 2>not every other kid would have been </v>

3228
02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:34.290
<v Speaker 2>privy to those talents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always bring that point up when I talk</v>

3229
02:32:34.291 --> 02:32:36.270
<v Speaker 2>about Jon Jones hose that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

3230
02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:38.490
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry.</v>

3231
02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Former UFC light heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most talented fighters</v>

3232
02:32:41.791 --> 02:32:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really tall,</v>

3233
02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:48.780
<v Speaker 2>long reach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular athletic ability and one the</v>

3234
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:50.850
<v Speaker 2>year he was the youngest ever UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

3235
02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just dominate which era.</v>

3236
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:57.750
<v Speaker 2>This era he beat Mauricio Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3237
02:32:57.751 --> 02:33:02.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the title and just destroyed him in </v>

3238
02:33:02.751 --> 02:33:04.740
<v Speaker 2>his first title fight in the shoguns </v>
<v Speaker 2>like famous world class.</v>

3239
02:33:04.741 --> 02:33:07.230
<v Speaker 2>MMA fighters fought the best of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history.</v>

3240
02:33:07.530 --> 02:33:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And what he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>

3241
02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.030
<v Speaker 2>no matter how hard you train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

3242
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:14.550
<v Speaker 2>If you're just a regular dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to be that guy.</v>

3243
02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:17.340
<v Speaker 2>If he trains just as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

3244
02:33:17.430 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just very talented.</v>

3245
02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Very physically talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3246
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:22.760
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:26.310
<v Speaker 2>There's where not created equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just not just not.</v>

3248
02:33:26.390 --> 02:33:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>

3249
02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

3250
02:33:29.730 --> 02:33:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

3251
02:33:30.621 --> 02:33:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I have not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in person,</v>

3252
02:33:32.011 --> 02:33:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

3253
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:36.060
<v Speaker 2>As a 13 or 14 year old trying to sneak </v>
<v Speaker 2>into good Lord.</v>

3254
02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:37.460
<v Speaker 2>That is impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3255
02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Can I also mentioned that he's Jewish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just to let you go look at that.</v>

3256
02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:42.570
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Klan,</v>

3257
02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:43.800
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3258
02:33:43.801 --> 02:33:48.801
<v Speaker 2>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this a world atlas of being </v>

3259
02:33:48.801 --> 02:33:52.790
<v Speaker 2>sizes that came out and I wish to engage</v>
<v Speaker 2>in modesty,</v>

3260
02:33:53.551 --> 02:33:57.480
<v Speaker 2>but you might want to check the scores </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Lebanese men just for giant.</v>

3261
02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying congratulations.</v>

3262
02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations on your people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second place to black folks though,</v>

3263
02:34:02.671 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were up there.</v>

3264
02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:10.640
<v Speaker 2>They were out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know everyone starts out dates.</v>

3265
02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Just patriarchy that women have bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>dicks than men.</v>

3266
02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3267
02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:17.680
<v Speaker 2>It's the patriarchy that makes their </v>
<v Speaker 2>clitoris is smaller penises.</v>

3268
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that there's going to </v>

3269
02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:24.601
<v Speaker 2>become a time in our lifetimes at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever wear this climate is going to </v>

3270
02:34:25.001 --> 02:34:30.001
<v Speaker 2>adjust back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it going to take 100 years for just </v>

3271
02:34:30.001 --> 02:34:30.260
<v Speaker 2>back to some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that question so,</v>

3272
02:34:30.310 --> 02:34:35.310
<v Speaker 2>so fascinating because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for me to predict what the </v>

3273
02:34:35.310 --> 02:34:37.420
<v Speaker 2>trajectory would be on the one hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on my pessimistic day.</v>

3274
02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3275
02:34:39.390 --> 02:34:41.920
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all great empires imploded from within.</v>

3276
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:42.790
<v Speaker 2>You've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3277
02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:46.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not that there's sort of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hordes of other folks that come in,</v>

3278
02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:51.390
<v Speaker 2>it's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the empire that becomes cancerous </v>

3279
02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:53.230
<v Speaker 2>within itself and it implodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on my pessimistic days,</v>

3280
02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3281
02:34:53.921 --> 02:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>we're screwed.</v>

3282
02:34:54.970 --> 02:34:59.970
<v Speaker 2>This is just going to go on further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>further until the whole west collapses </v>

3283
02:34:59.970 --> 02:35:02.140
<v Speaker 2>in this grand lunacy that we're engaged </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3284
02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the whole west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not everyone.</v>

3285
02:35:05.981 --> 02:35:10.981
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't represented by this </v>

3286
02:35:10.981 --> 02:35:14.041
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the intelligentsia who </v>

3287
02:35:14.041 --> 02:35:14.041
<v Speaker 2>controlled the information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3288
02:35:14.041 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't really control information </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore is my point.</v>

3289
02:35:15.221 --> 02:35:20.221
<v Speaker 2>The Internet Internet information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true and it's not even the </v>

3290
02:35:20.221 --> 02:35:21.310
<v Speaker 2>intelligentsia that's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's children.</v>

3291
02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:24.570
<v Speaker 2>It's students that are scaring the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of teacher.</v>

3292
02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3293
02:35:25.721 --> 02:35:28.780
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Tumbler and facebook and these</v>

3294
02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>people that formed these insulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups where there their echo chambers </v>

3295
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:34.690
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3296
02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:37.150
<v Speaker 2>they believe that this is reality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3297
02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:39.130
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to yell at it.</v>

3298
02:35:39.131 --> 02:35:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter,</v>

3299
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and then they get the fucking mic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even crazier.</v>

3300
02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 2>They let those kids who screamed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelled,</v>

3301
02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:48.040
<v Speaker 2>they let them talk and incredible.</v>

3302
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Just like that's the worst fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>message to send.</v>

3303
02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:53.140
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will let you have the mic.</v>

3304
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.870
<v Speaker 2>We will let you have to stop screaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>at him.</v>

3305
02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.570
<v Speaker 2>So what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you more optimistic?</v>

3306
02:35:58.571 --> 02:36:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that will be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3307
02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:02.110
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that how would it work?</v>

3308
02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Because kids today are growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to conversations like this and</v>

3309
02:36:05.051 --> 02:36:08.500
<v Speaker 2>realizing how retarded these 20 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>olds are and that they're going,</v>

3310
02:36:08.501 --> 02:36:13.501
<v Speaker 2>I want to be that when I get older I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to look at things for what they </v>

3311
02:36:13.501 --> 02:36:13.501
<v Speaker 2>really are and I think that as they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that position,</v>

3312
02:36:13.501 --> 02:36:18.301
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new crop will have grown up and </v>

3313
02:36:18.301 --> 02:36:20.851
<v Speaker 2>come out of this dark hole that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clan that grew up with social media.</v>

3314
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:27.630
<v Speaker 2>They grew up in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these groups with massive confirmation </v>

3315
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:27.630
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3316
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:32.430
<v Speaker 2>And this confirmation bias I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of in these certain ways is kind of</v>

3317
02:36:33.251 --> 02:36:33.820
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

3318
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:39.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not to blow smoke up your </v>

3319
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:42.391
<v Speaker 2>proverbial behind on your birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the wonderful things in the </v>

3320
02:36:42.391 --> 02:36:46.980
<v Speaker 2>last year has been to appear on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>show precisely because I've seen the </v>

3321
02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:49.960
<v Speaker 2>reach that you have just in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have responded to my work.</v>

3322
02:36:49.961 --> 02:36:54.961
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most scientists will toil in </v>

3323
02:36:54.961 --> 02:36:55.270
<v Speaker 2>their respective disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean hopefully they do good stuff,</v>

3324
02:36:55.570 --> 02:37:00.570
<v Speaker 2>but the number of people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately are communicating with as if </v>

3325
02:37:00.570 --> 02:37:00.610
<v Speaker 2>it was a very restrained small number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3326
02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:05.910
<v Speaker 2>But by coming on these types of shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I think we were talking </v>

3327
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.910
<v Speaker 2>earlier about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3328
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:07.630
<v Speaker 2>coming out of your shell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in the public discourse,</v>

3329
02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:12.840
<v Speaker 2>weighing in on these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always a debate some of my colleagues,</v>

3330
02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:16.520
<v Speaker 2>many of whom are very much in the ivory </v>
<v Speaker 2>tower,</v>

3331
02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:21.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only communicate with other members </v>

3332
02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:21.640
<v Speaker 2>of the clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3333
02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:25.370
<v Speaker 2>With other members of our restricted the</v>
<v Speaker 2>class of high brow.</v>

3334
02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:28.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's not really what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the job of a professor is.</v>

3335
02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the job we have to create</v>

3336
02:37:30.351 --> 02:37:32.810
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and communicated to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>academics,</v>

3337
02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:36.380
<v Speaker 2>but if we're good academics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're good men have ideas,</v>

3338
02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:38.710
<v Speaker 2>we also have to be engaging the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3339
02:37:38.711 --> 02:37:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean ultimately the public also pays </v>
<v Speaker 2>for my salary through also.</v>

3340
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Speaker 2>That's how information really gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreaded.</v>

3341
02:37:44.910 --> 02:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get spread by bouncing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>around amongst each other,</v>

3342
02:37:47.421 --> 02:37:50.300
<v Speaker 2>like a little beach ball at a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3343
02:37:50.301 --> 02:37:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Gets spread by getting it out there into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great channel of the Internet.</v>

3344
02:37:54.470 --> 02:37:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the number of people that have heard </v>

3345
02:37:59.470 --> 02:38:02.291
<v Speaker 2>of my evolutionary psychology work as </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied to consumer behavior and so on </v>

3346
02:38:02.291 --> 02:38:06.490
<v Speaker 2>through just having been on your show is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will probably take me 10 careers </v>

3347
02:38:06.490 --> 02:38:11.140
<v Speaker 2>before I could reach as many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>through some other forum and so I agree </v>

3348
02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:14.270
<v Speaker 2>with you in that sense that these types </v>
<v Speaker 2>of forums are profoundly important.</v>

3349
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I only wish that more academics would </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have the courage to start </v>

3350
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:22.040
<v Speaker 2>coming on these types as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous for them financially</v>

3351
02:38:22.041 --> 02:38:24.920
<v Speaker 2>independent and these and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments that we have today.</v>

3352
02:38:24.921 --> 02:38:29.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could cherry pick a million things </v>

3353
02:38:29.921 --> 02:38:31.931
<v Speaker 2>that are said in this show and take them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of context and paint me out to be </v>

3354
02:38:31.931 --> 02:38:31.931
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

3355
02:38:31.931 --> 02:38:36.780
<v Speaker 2>That's just the nature of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone where you </v>

3356
02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:40.661
<v Speaker 2>joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you take it and put it in </v>

3357
02:38:40.661 --> 02:38:44.261
<v Speaker 2>quotes in print and you take something </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the context of the conversation </v>

3358
02:38:46.131 --> 02:38:51.131
<v Speaker 2>and put it in print and you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can infer all sorts of different </v>

3359
02:38:51.131 --> 02:38:52.670
<v Speaker 2>ways that this person is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>

3360
02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:55.910
<v Speaker 2>That could be construed as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive and then it gets.</v>

3361
02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.390
<v Speaker 2>It gets gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between back then and now</v>

3362
02:38:59.450 --> 02:39:02.480
<v Speaker 2>is now you could always just go on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and talk about.</v>

3363
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:07.750
<v Speaker 2>You could always write a facebook blog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and explain yourself in great detail </v>

3364
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:12.131
<v Speaker 2>with no editorial input whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can come along and take away from</v>

3365
02:39:12.261 --> 02:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

3366
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>written things and then had those </v>

3367
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:21.251
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even publishing online magazines has </v>

3368
02:39:21.251 --> 02:39:23.921
<v Speaker 2>those things heavily edited and chopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and even had words put in their </v>

3369
02:39:23.921 --> 02:39:24.920
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a dispute with this journalist and</v>

3370
02:39:24.921 --> 02:39:25.970
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about something and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3371
02:39:25.971 --> 02:39:28.340
<v Speaker 2>why did you save that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

3372
02:39:28.341 --> 02:39:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

3373
02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the editor put that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3374
02:39:31.430 --> 02:39:33.530
<v Speaker 2>you're kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do that.</v>

3375
02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:34.520
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3376
02:39:34.521 --> 02:39:36.980
<v Speaker 2>they add things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's fucking insane.</v>

3377
02:39:37.010 --> 02:39:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced something similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that on several occasions.</v>

3378
02:39:40.041 --> 02:39:42.800
<v Speaker 2>So one time a guy called me when my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

3379
02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:46.520
<v Speaker 2>the book has pornography and it's titled</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consuming instinct and it's subtitle</v>

3380
02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:47.900
<v Speaker 2>and he really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3381
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:52.990
<v Speaker 2>the key point he wanted to get to was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that professor sad argues that there is </v>

3382
02:39:53.511 --> 02:39:58.511
<v Speaker 2>a gene for porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course I'm not at all arguing </v>

3383
02:39:58.511 --> 02:40:02.261
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kept repeatedly explaining to him </v>

3384
02:40:02.261 --> 02:40:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that to explain the evolutionary basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of why men might enjoy porn doesn't </v>

3385
02:40:06.171 --> 02:40:09.430
<v Speaker 2>suggest that there's a set of genes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your genome that you know,</v>

3386
02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>that cold for porn preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I explained.</v>

3387
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 2>So please don't.</v>

3388
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Next day you know exactly what he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to course.</v>

3389
02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just learn to.</v>

3390
02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

3391
02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:23.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3392
02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not intellectual honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is is they're trying to get </v>

3393
02:40:28.430 --> 02:40:31.400
<v Speaker 1>clicks to trying to get people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it and that's what they do </v>

3394
02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.720
<v Speaker 1>and they can do it for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a transitionary time between</v>

3395
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:37.560
<v Speaker 1>this time that we're at now where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is still this a bit of cloudiness,</v>

3396
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:42.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of fog in the air of </v>

3397
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.590
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3398
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just sometimes it's hard to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out exactly what the fuck is going on,</v>

3399
02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:49.071
<v Speaker 1>but that fog is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to being lifted and sheer </v>

3400
02:40:49.071 --> 02:40:52.701
<v Speaker 1>intent I think will be displayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be a part of discourse in a way </v>

3401
02:40:52.891 --> 02:40:55.830
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think has existed before in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the near future.</v>

3402
02:40:56.030 --> 02:41:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to be able to know </v>

3403
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot more about what someone's trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to portray just in the next decade or so</v>

3404
02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:06.920
<v Speaker 1>than we've ever known in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the transparency like that you </v>

3405
02:41:06.961 --> 02:41:11.961
<v Speaker 1>have like the transparency that not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your words and how you,</v>

3406
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:15.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are able to communicate and describe</v>

3407
02:41:15.571 --> 02:41:20.571
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in how you're able to defend </v>

3408
02:41:20.571 --> 02:41:23.241
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something comes up that just didn't </v>

3409
02:41:23.241 --> 02:41:24.600
<v Speaker 1>exist before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had no recourse if somebody misquoted</v>

3410
02:41:24.601 --> 02:41:29.601
<v Speaker 1>you or an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had that happen before a long time </v>

3411
02:41:29.601 --> 02:41:32.841
<v Speaker 1>ago and like 99,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman wrote an article about my </v>

3412
02:41:32.841 --> 02:41:36.171
<v Speaker 1>show or one of my cds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did a review of my cd and not just </v>

3413
02:41:36.511 --> 02:41:41.511
<v Speaker 1>took me out of context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but completely misquoted me and changed </v>

3414
02:41:41.581 --> 02:41:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the words of my bits to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible and I had a conversation on the</v>

3415
02:41:46.321 --> 02:41:47.550
<v Speaker 1>phone with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my publicist.</v>

3416
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you do that?</v>

3417
02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3418
02:41:49.621 --> 02:41:51.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what I heard when I heard your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

3419
02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you heard.</v>

3420
02:41:53.130 --> 02:41:54.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what you heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3421
02:41:54.431 --> 02:41:56.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I wrote,</v>

3422
02:41:56.250 --> 02:41:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I wrote.</v>

3423
02:41:58.490 --> 02:42:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And so you lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3424
02:42:00.151 --> 02:42:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3425
02:42:01.721 --> 02:42:02.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a journalist,</v>

3426
02:42:02.641 --> 02:42:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you're a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she thought I left the phone.</v>

3427
02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:09.000
<v Speaker 1>She started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left and hung up because I just,</v>

3428
02:42:09.001 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3429
02:42:09.541 --> 02:42:10.980
<v Speaker 1>we're done talking then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3430
02:42:11.370 --> 02:42:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And so she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>

3431
02:42:13.741 --> 02:42:15.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a pause and so she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the publishers,</v>

3432
02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:17.850
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your client is losing it.</v>

3433
02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not losing it.</v>

3434
02:42:19.531 --> 02:42:24.531
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not understand what happened </v>

3435
02:42:24.531 --> 02:42:27.141
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a story about her in my blog </v>

3436
02:42:27.141 --> 02:42:27.860
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3437
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.410
<v Speaker 1>just I called yellow journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the title of it,</v>

3438
02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:33.300
<v Speaker 1>about how ridiculous she was.</v>

3439
02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And it was the first time that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever do something like that.</v>

3440
02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the old days you would have to get it</v>

3441
02:42:37.531 --> 02:42:38.430
<v Speaker 1>printed somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3442
02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:40.980
<v Speaker 1>to get it printed in a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck writing,</v>

3443
02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:43.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an article about how um,</v>

3444
02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:48.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to love someone because they </v>

3445
02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:50.070
<v Speaker 1>were so full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what I said.</v>

3446
02:42:50.071 --> 02:42:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to upset her,</v>

3447
02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:52.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3448
02:42:52.530 --> 02:42:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but that used to be what they could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3449
02:42:56.371 --> 02:43:01.371
<v Speaker 1>that some guy could listen to you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about genes and pornography and how men </v>

3450
02:43:01.651 --> 02:43:03.750
<v Speaker 1>could be more attracted to pornography </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

3451
02:43:03.751 --> 02:43:08.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to make this fucking </v>

3452
02:43:08.751 --> 02:43:08.751
<v Speaker 1>salacious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to make that guy look like an</v>

3453
02:43:08.751 --> 02:43:08.850
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say,</v>

3454
02:43:08.851 --> 02:43:13.851
<v Speaker 1>this professor thinks there's a gene for</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're prints and done.</v>

3455
02:43:15.370 --> 02:43:16.060
<v Speaker 1>What can he do?</v>

3456
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can he do?</v>

3457
02:43:16.841 --> 02:43:18.010
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that guy's name?</v>

3458
02:43:18.510 --> 02:43:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3459
02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And will fight for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could probably find that out.</v>

3460
02:43:23.050 --> 02:43:24.310
<v Speaker 1>We know what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3461
02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:25.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did too.</v>

3462
02:43:25.081 --> 02:43:26.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3463
02:43:27.010 --> 02:43:29.680
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you've had a platform because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3464
02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an entertainment.</v>

3465
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:36.210
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed by guys who start youtube </v>

3466
02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:36.210
<v Speaker 1>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently appeared on a,</v>

3467
02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:39.070
<v Speaker 1>on a youtube channel that Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls himself Sargon of awkward.</v>

3468
02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:40.600
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

3469
02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:42.940
<v Speaker 1>he's a nobody in the sense of not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from,</v>

3470
02:43:42.941 --> 02:43:47.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an acting world or not being a public </v>

3471
02:43:47.941 --> 02:43:47.941
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is brilliant.</v>

3472
02:43:47.941 --> 02:43:50.170
<v Speaker 1>He now has over 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube subscribers,</v>

3473
02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:53.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$30 million viewers.</v>

3474
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3475
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's based on merit and start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3476
02:43:56.950 --> 02:44:00.120
<v Speaker 1>This guy would never have had a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were it?</v>

3477
02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Not for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3478
02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:04.240
<v Speaker 1>the mediums that we are now afforded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

3479
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a kid in a candy store to </v>

3480
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>appear on all these shows because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers me a voice to spread means,</v>

3481
02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:16.741
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I consider my job as a meme </v>

3482
02:44:16.741 --> 02:44:18.250
<v Speaker 1>creator mean propagator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so any way that I can do that,</v>

3483
02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 1>including coming on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3484
02:44:19.570 --> 02:44:22.870
<v Speaker 1>this brilliant podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself unbelievably fortunate</v>

3485
02:44:22.871 --> 02:44:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and I don't see why other academics </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see the value in death.</v>

3486
02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Well I think they will eventually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some do.</v>

3487
02:44:27.851 --> 02:44:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had quite a few on now,</v>

3488
02:44:29.861 --> 02:44:34.861
<v Speaker 1>but I think that what we're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a new thing we're dealing with is </v>

3489
02:44:34.861 --> 02:44:38.101
<v Speaker 1>this completely new pathway to for </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to travel and it has to be </v>

3490
02:44:38.651 --> 02:44:41.290
<v Speaker 1>kind of recognized and accept and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly being done.</v>

3491
02:44:41.291 --> 02:44:44.650
<v Speaker 1>So like there's a sign in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store and one of the hotels,</v>

3492
02:44:44.651 --> 02:44:44.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3493
02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they paint the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a billboard on the entire side of </v>

3494
02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the hotel and it's a youtube channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has millions of subscribers.</v>

3495
02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So this woman's Youtube Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of her before,</v>

3496
02:44:54.071 --> 02:44:59.071
<v Speaker 1>but she's got millions of subscribers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a few of those that youtube </v>

3497
02:44:59.071 --> 02:45:02.731
<v Speaker 1>has put up all around the city and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting for each individual </v>

3498
02:45:02.731 --> 02:45:05.200
<v Speaker 1>video that they put out is very similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what a hit cable show gets.</v>

3499
02:45:05.650 --> 02:45:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's reality and you can't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

3500
02:45:07.901 --> 02:45:12.901
<v Speaker 1>Those are real numbers and real people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are the same kind of people that </v>

3501
02:45:12.901 --> 02:45:14.210
<v Speaker 1>watch television and it's just a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway for information.</v>

3502
02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it harder for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie and bullshit.</v>

3503
02:45:17.770 --> 02:45:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And like that guy who wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

3504
02:45:19.271 --> 02:45:24.271
<v Speaker 1>he's just lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lazy and just work sucks and his </v>

3505
02:45:24.271 --> 02:45:26.200
<v Speaker 1>mind's week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he wants to come up with some way</v>

3506
02:45:26.201 --> 02:45:29.320
<v Speaker 1>that he can turn something in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some click baity bullshit article.</v>

3507
02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:34.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He distorts reality to fit his own </v>

3508
02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:34.600
<v Speaker 1>agenda and for his own game.</v>

3509
02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does so in a way that he doesn't </v>

3510
02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:39.790
<v Speaker 1>care for damages you because he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>power over you.</v>

3511
02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any power over you </v>

3512
02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:44.820
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one does.</v>

3513
02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:47.251
<v Speaker 1>No one has any power of anyone and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever of mart or wherever the fuck </v>

3514
02:45:47.251 --> 02:45:49.190
<v Speaker 1>the guy's name was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I'm putting,</v>

3515
02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:51.010
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get millions of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

3516
02:45:51.570 --> 02:45:54.940
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got there based on merit,</v>

3517
02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of those guys out </v>

3518
02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.831
<v Speaker 1>there now and they cover a wide variety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of topics to whether it's sports,</v>

3519
02:46:02.561 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 1>there's martial arts commentators that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done that.</v>

3520
02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that do that about </v>

3521
02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:11.060
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we live in a beautiful time to</v>
