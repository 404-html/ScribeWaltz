<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming out.</v>

11
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Sorry we couldn't stick around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

12
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.164
<v Speaker 1>I've had a stomach bug since Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was severely worried that I was going </v>

13
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>to shit myself during the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worried I was going to shit myself</v>

14
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.634
<v Speaker 1>during the UFC and the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't eat all day and then right </v>

15
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>before I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>

16
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I got to eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>my stomach's been fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids had some sort of a bug,</v>

18
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>so some sort of a flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole house had it.</v>

19
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:42.764
<v Speaker 1>My wife had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughters had it and I didn't get it </v>

20
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.334
<v Speaker 1>until I got to Vegas and on Vegas I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out with delegate a Thursday and </v>

21
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I was burping and farting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

22
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:51.494
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the middle of the night I woke </v>

23
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

24
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ain't good,</v>

25
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.753
<v Speaker 1>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I couldn't eat </v>

26
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

27
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Hold anything down and right before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC I said,</v>

28
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.071
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta eat something.</v>

29
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So I had some case at Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took a chance and I was like,</v>

30
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I might very well have to sprint to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitter.</v>

31
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So I got through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>it was in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried I was gonna have to</v>

33
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>shoot myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I pulled it out and then a wrecked a</v>

34
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>bathroom afterwards.</v>

35
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Was that time where you can smell it </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of your body and you're like,</v>

36
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.014
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing yesterday I </v>

37
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.493
<v Speaker 1>couldn't eat all day before the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't eat a goddamn thing and then </v>

38
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 1>right before we were in the dressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>room I go,</v>

39
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired or I feel kind of weak.</v>

40
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.633
<v Speaker 1>So I had some cheese and some meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I didn't stick around </v>

41
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>after the show ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you came,</v>

42
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>we had a good God damn time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured yet sick because you made like</v>

43
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:47.471
<v Speaker 1>a beer meet fucking omelet or some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your family that.</v>

44
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody got sick from school,</v>

45
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

46
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.084
<v Speaker 1>they just get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them together and </v>

47
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>they just somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever think about that?</v>

48
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the first person who got VD?</v>

49
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>That'd be one dirty motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was number of.</v>

50
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That has to be a sanction because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows kid.</v>

51
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>There's one person like VD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Like that had to come from an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

53
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's some.</v>

54
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.093
<v Speaker 1>Every coal has to come from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently a lot of the calls we get </v>

55
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:17.414
<v Speaker 1>come from agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's all like swine flu and </v>

56
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:20.804
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The white man brought it here to the </v>

57
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Indians will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

58
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.964
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're just sick as fuck and </v>

59
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:26.451
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

60
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>We went over that the other day and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

61
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of all native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>were wiped out by diseases that they </v>

62
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>didn't have an immune system for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Europeans came to the 1500.</v>

63
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.350
<v Speaker 1>So I can wipe any more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't actually killed in battle.</v>

64
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>no more of them died by disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not.</v>

66
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.693
<v Speaker 1>Fucking 90 percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy where she get that </v>

67
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 1>from the library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing that today.</v>

68
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing that today.</v>

69
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.583
<v Speaker 1>What figure</v>

70
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 3>library.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>

71
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 3>So a UFC 207.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the.</v>

72
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.013
<v Speaker 3>One of the craziest events of all time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and watching that main event was it was </v>

73
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 3>like there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was surreal.</v>

74
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's surreal because I was.</v>

75
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 3>My body was all weirded out because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a little out of it.</v>

76
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 3>What about the shit all over my chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also,</v>

77
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.221
<v Speaker 3>it was just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the least competitive like main</v>

78
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.444
<v Speaker 3>event other than although in Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was one dynamic shot to the </v>

79
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 3>chin that knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything about that was off.</v>

80
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Can you knit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you think about another main event,</v>

81
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 3>championship level where it was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of big of a discrepancy?</v>

82
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.254
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't even a fight and I think </v>

83
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.553
<v Speaker 3>leading up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some kind of red flags that </v>

84
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 3>you saw leading up to it.</v>

85
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Speaker 3>If you think back now that we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw,</v>

86
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.550
<v Speaker 3>everybody said right physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

87
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looked great,</v>

88
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 3>but like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of sparring was she doing?</v>

89
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:04.834
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I was thinking when </v>

90
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:05.944
<v Speaker 3>she was hitting pads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's sitting there hitting pads with </v>

91
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Edmond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

92
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 3>they're standing right in front of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

93
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Like she's not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just hitting pads,</v>

94
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.761
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>

95
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.061
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>

96
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop up of.</v>

97
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Tough to tell though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

98
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes they do it for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>

99
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 3>If the countdown crews there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to show your new shit.</v>

100
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 3>But also what did people think was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happen?</v>

101
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Like did you think this whole time when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's shooting these movies,</v>

102
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.951
<v Speaker 3>doing southern admin her come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan for her to stick on the outside jab</v>

103
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 3>and move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>

104
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 3>that's not in her DNA anyway.</v>

105
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 3>She had to close the distance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>clench,</v>

106
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be the only plant.</v>

107
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 3>The idea of standing with Amanda Nunez </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just ridiculous.</v>

108
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 3>The difference in punching power is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally doubled,</v>

109
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.753
<v Speaker 3>but we've seen her fight take punches </v>
<v Speaker 3>before who a batch could hit pretty </v>

110
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying similar,</v>

111
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying what bench did.</v>

112
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 3>She has decent power and she's a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>

113
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 3>She throws volume strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she throws her arms.</v>

114
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't hit nearly as hard as Amanda</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Amanda.</v>

115
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Torques or whole body in his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree Jo.</v>

116
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

117
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.843
<v Speaker 3>it's and batches arm for this long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan got damn telephone poles and that's </v>

118
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 3>all fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think the game plan should</v>

119
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 3>have been get her to the ground and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried that a little bit.</v>

120
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 3>She didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was already lit up.</v>

121
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't there though mentally that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm saying there's,</v>

122
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 3>there's things leading up to it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think the biggest red red flag for me,</v>

123
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.543
<v Speaker 3>and you know Dana better than anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a promoter through and through one </v>

124
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the best of all time.</v>

125
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don King I guess,</v>

126
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 3>but still for him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

127
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 3>you can skip all the media shit and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on the fight.</v>

128
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.451
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

129
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:38.284
<v Speaker 3>that just doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why she's managed by or she's </v>

130
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 3>handled by William Morris Endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wme.</v>

131
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Wme owns UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm aware of the shore.</v>

132
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.093
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing that was his </v>

133
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 3>decision was his decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

134
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let we agreed to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in our contracts.</v>

135
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 3>One time thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never do it again.</v>

136
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

137
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>that is so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She must've put it in the contract.</v>

138
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 3>She must've said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I want to do.</v>

139
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk to any media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to go to red flag.</v>

140
00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you not have connor did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

141
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.000
<v Speaker 3>connor doesn't have the choice coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>into connor said it,</v>

142
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 3>but if connor did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have connor said,</v>

143
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 3>fuck all this fucking media.</v>

144
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to train.</v>

145
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 3>He would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he did,</v>

146
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
<v Speaker 3>I'd have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Red flagged out to anyone involved at </v>

147
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana this say it's all good.</v>

148
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

149
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 3>She goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes out,</v>

150
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>grabs hold of Man Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flips her on her head.</v>

151
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Semi unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catches her in an arm bar.</v>

152
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 3>She's the new champ and 35 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not saying this.</v>

153
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

154
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.933
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't say there's a red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she went out and dominated it and </v>

155
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>then got an arm bar in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would definitely not say that.</v>

156
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.913
<v Speaker 3>Skipping the media is a red flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then she'll only saying it because </v>

157
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>this is like armchair quarterbacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not though,</v>

158
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 3>because that says a red flag before this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if she.</v>

159
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.053
<v Speaker 3>So she did interviews afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say she went out the dominator in </v>

160
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 3>a minute submitted and then she did </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews afterwards.</v>

161
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

162
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Because she just said I'm not doing any </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat at all.</v>

163
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.303
<v Speaker 3>Even post post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she doesn't want to talk after </v>

164
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.514
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean why would you want the other </v>

165
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 3>thing in the whole cell on this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was she serious?</v>

166
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Now she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

167
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 3>She's focused knowing that you serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>now the whole thing.</v>

168
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was like this big </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious marketing perspective,</v>

169
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 3>like a promotional Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

170
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Like they had the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a really good guy.</v>

171
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:25.074
<v Speaker 3>He pumped up like that whole thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>her coming back and they lift up the </v>

172
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 3>garage doors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see are working out really hard and it's</v>

173
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 3>what they did is they created a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>hype piece.</v>

174
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the Ronda Rousey business.</v>

175
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez going,</v>

176
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 3>what exactly did you get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My best was the best.</v>

177
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:41.714
<v Speaker 3>Was there a picture of promoting this </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC and there's a picture of Ronda and </v>

178
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 3>her fight.</v>

179
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Karen Ronda and the street clothes goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's back to oh seven.</v>

180
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

181
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 3>What about Amanda?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say in this crazy mixture,</v>

182
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 3>who did that picture that he was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>official UFC,</v>

183
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 3>UFC kind of a social media post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

184
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now what do you do?</v>

185
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It's also crazy because it's crazy for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>marketing perspective.</v>

186
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of people thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda was going to win a lot of people.</v>

187
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I was 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows me too?</v>

188
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly how I felt when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching that fight play out.</v>

189
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows?</v>

190
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see.</v>

191
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.283
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda looked like she was in amazing </v>

192
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:20.174
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think about the things that Ron has </v>

193
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 3>been able to do in the past to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Mcmahon,</v>

194
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe she ties her up in a clench.</v>

195
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Blasts or the need of the body flips her</v>
<v Speaker 3>on her back and arm bars or who the fuck</v>

196
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 3>knows if she gets you on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her arm bar technique is outstanding.</v>

197
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just some of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the best I've ever seen that that</v>

198
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 3>could have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so.</v>

199
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the moment she got hit,</v>

200
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.693
<v Speaker 3>she's not moving her head at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's standing straight up in the air </v>

201
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.023
<v Speaker 3>and then I see her legs get close </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and that's when you know </v>

202
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 3>someone's really hurt when someone gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>lit up and then they start moving,</v>

203
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 3>but their legs are too close together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not working right.</v>

204
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they kind of know what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

205
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not their balances and good.</v>

206
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:03.694
<v Speaker 3>There was no head movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was probably hurt with like the </v>

207
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 3>second or third punch that Amanda hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>her with.</v>

208
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>She was probably on Queer Street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woke her up.</v>

209
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know where she was until she </v>
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

210
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that when she got hit.</v>

211
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:16.081
<v Speaker 3>When you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

212
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 3>she's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's hurt.</v>

213
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Look at her face and you even said it </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

214
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:21.714
<v Speaker 3>She threw up and kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She threw some kicks to try to keep </v>

215
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Amanda off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she didn't realize.</v>

216
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 3>I think when Amanda Hits Girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just go,</v>

217
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

218
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 3>But what else would you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else would you expect in that?</v>

219
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't realize to get hit,</v>

220
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:34.914
<v Speaker 3>but you hear all the criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now have a Edmond who's obviously a </v>

221
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 3>terrible coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but take that out of it.</v>

222
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 3>If if you bring a horse to water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't drink,</v>

223
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if mentally she doesn't want to be in</v>

224
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:46.764
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think we didn't want to be in </v>

225
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.393
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

226
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 3>It didn't look like the same tenacity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were used to seeing challenged.</v>

227
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.863
<v Speaker 3>Super tenacious until she got cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Is 44 seconds when more than that </v>

228
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.140
<v Speaker 3>First Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got hurt with a right hand.</v>

229
00:10:02.141 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 10:50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't watch the whole fight fight.</v>

230
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 3>It's 47 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

231
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.693
<v Speaker 3>You good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

232
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.280
<v Speaker 3>it's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>

233
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighters before,</v>

234
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think it is?</v>

235
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you even saying this?</v>

236
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.883
<v Speaker 3>You see that she got hit and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got hurt and you've been hitting </v>

237
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 3>hurt before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know what happens.</v>

238
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

239
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.723
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think however that jab put her lights </v>

240
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:28.330
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just a Jap.</v>

241
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Did she hit her with a Jap that landed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one?</v>

242
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 3>She went into Cape closed desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First Jab landed,</v>

243
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>but then she got hit with many punches.</v>

244
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why you're confused </v>
<v Speaker 3>as to the result.</v>

245
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean she got hit by the biggest power </v>
<v Speaker 3>puncher in 135 pound division by far.</v>

246
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 3>There's not a single girl in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>division that punches like Amanda does.</v>

247
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.273
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not that it wasn't a right hand </v>

248
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 3>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes it was.</v>

249
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>It was a jab right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a right hand right after that,</v>

250
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.283
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once run to try to close the distance </v>

251
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.513
<v Speaker 3>was 40 seconds of Amanda Punching Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face until Rhonda would out like </v>

252
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:00.804
<v Speaker 3>the idea that some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's confusing that she didn't </v>

253
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:03.654
<v Speaker 3>look like she wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was hurt multiple times in those </v>

254
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 3>exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

255
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I think we're doing a lot of armchair </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarterbacking,</v>

256
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows what was going on?</v>

257
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Know what you're speculating whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not she wanted to be there after she got</v>

258
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

259
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 3>The problem is she might've been just </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocked and there's also the reality that</v>

260
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:21.594
<v Speaker 3>she was knocked out fucking cold a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and it was a bad beating and then a </v>

261
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.144
<v Speaker 3>vicious head kick and there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about those Goddamn neck </v>

262
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:31.284
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

263
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>There's something about when when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone shins you in the neck,</v>

264
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 3>like she got shin and your whole body </v>
<v Speaker 3>just goes limp.</v>

265
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 3>You're doing so much damage in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had a 411 days off.</v>

266
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just bad strategy.</v>

267
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.633
<v Speaker 3>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the strategy was not good as </v>

268
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.870
<v Speaker 3>possible to all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

269
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I was the one who said like way early </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

270
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I think Amanda is our most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge because Amanda hits so fucking</v>

271
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 3>heart after she starts Sara Mcmahon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when she,</v>

272
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>when she was beaten up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michelle was like,</v>

273
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Jesus said she punches harder than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody in that division.</v>

274
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>She's got like dangerous weapons with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her hands,</v>

275
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.193
<v Speaker 3>but I think I really think there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that get killed like that and </v>

276
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>they are never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't absorb a shot anymore.</v>

277
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.453
<v Speaker 3>And then also in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to chocolate Delhi he was </v>

278
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>telling me about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because chuck was so tough that he would</v>

279
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>like just fucking use his chin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like Linacre does.</v>

280
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.684
<v Speaker 3>Like it's part of his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like knowing that he can absorb shots </v>

281
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 3>and after a while his brain was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

282
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like his brain was just like,</v>

283
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

284
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:37.420
<v Speaker 3>just shuts off early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think tech to you,</v>

285
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain level where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're that great and you look at</v>

286
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:41.634
<v Speaker 3>it like a tiger woods or Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that foundation get the little </v>

287
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 3>shaky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just never the same.</v>

288
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

289
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.123
<v Speaker 3>It's just never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

290
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not God's gift to the use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

291
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 3>MMA gods don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

292
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:53.704
<v Speaker 3>and then like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if she was undefeated and she </v>

293
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.243
<v Speaker 3>fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nunez Nunez going to give her a problem </v>

294
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.140
<v Speaker 3>because if you watched like the Misha </v>
<v Speaker 3>tate fight me should take.</v>

295
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though she beat me,</v>

296
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 3>she would take twice me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd take,</v>

297
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:04.354
<v Speaker 3>gave her a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some good scrambles and be </v>

298
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.753
<v Speaker 3>state hitter with some punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Amanda Hits You with punches like </v>

299
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:10.414
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fuck.</v>

300
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 3>You can't make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in trouble.</v>

301
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like a lot of ways.</v>

302
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like a female rumble and that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>might not be able to close the show with</v>

303
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 3>one shot like rumble can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you make mistakes,</v>

304
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you get stung so bad and you see it with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sara mcmann fights.</v>

305
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:28.500
<v Speaker 3>A perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she cracked Sarah with a right hand.</v>

306
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 3>You see her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her whole face is like,</v>

307
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 3>what the f?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody hits them like that.</v>

308
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.693
<v Speaker 3>Nobody and she's long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda catches you on the end of those </v>

309
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.223
<v Speaker 3>punches too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She.</v>

310
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.153
<v Speaker 3>She's great at distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think that the game is evolving </v>

311
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 3>so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where Amanda,</v>

312
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>all she cares about is being champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All she does is trained.</v>

313
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:49.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing she gives a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

314
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 3>I think we saw the same thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant coups,</v>

315
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 3>cody garbrandt fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All cody wants to do is be champ.</v>

316
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Dominic's doing analyst work for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's,</v>

317
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 3>there's this kind of change of hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now where you're seeing these guys</v>

318
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:03.754
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all in and that's what you have </v>

319
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 3>to do to be in this game this day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

320
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Guys are too good there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

321
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think you're dead right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're dead right about that.</v>

322
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

323
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 3>We'll watch the whole thing live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

324
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Give us some volume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young Jamie.</v>

325
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.770
<v Speaker 3>So here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that jab landed with five second.</v>

326
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 3>This jab right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

327
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.130
<v Speaker 3>She stopped her right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.540
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's stunning.</v>

329
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Ten seconds in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at four.</v>

330
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Forty three were 15 seconds in and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

331
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 3>She's fucked right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fuck.</v>

332
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 3>That was a super hard and this is bad to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>

333
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 3>It's real hard to boom to the body to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ripped that shot to the body.</v>

334
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 3>So like the idea that she didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be there 10 seconds into the fight,</v>

335
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 3>she didn't know what the fuck was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

336
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>they're left right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand behind it.</v>

337
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 3>This is horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

338
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.090
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

339
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.933
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

340
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.310
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

341
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Great stoppage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But God damn Amanda Nunez as good.</v>

342
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 3>She put a finger up to her mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked right up to Edmond,</v>

343
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:10.270
<v Speaker 3>looked at show gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

344
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.030
<v Speaker 3>she's in another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got No doubt about it.</v>

345
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 3>You just know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's tough.</v>

346
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.373
<v Speaker 3>And also she's got that thick old neck </v>
<v Speaker 3>that helps the got long Amanda's arms </v>

347
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:24.480
<v Speaker 3>and she's great at keeping distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not crowding herself.</v>

348
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Amanda has a wide shoulders and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps too.</v>

349
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 3>And then long arms as well and she's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome distance man.</v>

350
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:32.174
<v Speaker 3>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her ability to catch you at the very </v>

351
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.604
<v Speaker 3>back of the punches for all the power is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're punching someone and </v>

352
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 3>you want to eat them here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just move forward a foot,</v>

353
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 3>you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose like 90 percent of your power.</v>

354
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.893
<v Speaker 3>Different game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think Amanda can fight guys that </v>

355
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 3>went 35?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

356
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 3>bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good guys.</v>

357
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.453
<v Speaker 3>No trains with super high level guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's not going to be Tj dillashaw </v>

358
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 3>on top 10 now it's changed now man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

359
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.563
<v Speaker 3>I think if you asked them that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>question three or four years ago would </v>

360
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:02.654
<v Speaker 3>have a different answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like that division is so stacked </v>

361
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:06.430
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one.</v>

362
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 3>One 35 first opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in the UFC was.</v>

363
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't as many guys that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>that elite.</v>

364
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.653
<v Speaker 3>He know there's like even watch the guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were really good improve like you </v>

365
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:19.124
<v Speaker 3>saw the cody fight where he was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic against dominick goddamn good </v>

366
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 3>to Tj.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look against Linacre.</v>

367
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Completely known five linacre nullify </v>
<v Speaker 3>them when a girl.</v>

368
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.963
<v Speaker 3>He's like one of the best examples of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy with absolutely freakish physical </v>

369
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 3>attributes of fucking iron jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iron.</v>

370
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 3>John never even seen the guy get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets hit by everybody,</v>

371
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 3>gets head kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets punched.</v>

372
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.163
<v Speaker 3>Rob said he hit him with the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch he ever hit anybody with his life </v>

373
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.343
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even knowledge that he hit </v>

374
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.350
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just walked right forward.</v>

375
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 3>He's and he hit him with a body shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt like you get hit by a car.</v>

376
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.463
<v Speaker 3>He didn't look like that Linacre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that same linacre showed </v>

377
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 3>up on Saturday or Friday and teaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

378
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Lynika was very hesitant and I think</v>

379
00:16:58.941 --> 00:16:59.774
<v Speaker 3>it's because of PJ's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he was fighting them with the </v>

380
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 3>faith that take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kicks and thrown that,</v>

381
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 3>that head kick to the body kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was very tentative.</v>

382
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 3>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got out beat.</v>

383
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You throw them in the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost had them in a capsule.</v>

384
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go for the twister.</v>

385
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

386
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.080
<v Speaker 3>if he goes to the twister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got went to the capsize it,</v>

387
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked it up.</v>

388
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not going to tap to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just pay a stomp.</v>

389
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 3>He needed to stomp down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tj looked amazing.</v>

390
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

391
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 3>And the timing and those takedowns like </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightning bolts,</v>

392
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 3>like it looks like he's throwing a punch</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's underneath Ya.</v>

393
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Just so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fast,</v>

394
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But God damn cody Garbrandt the fuck God</v>

395
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 3>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll admit I.</v>

396
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I said I think cody's going to be champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not just not yet.</v>

397
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be your champ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not ready for dom yet.</v>

398
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.660
<v Speaker 3>No opening round was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

399
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 3>He's so busy mimic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing break dancing.</v>

400
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.323
<v Speaker 3>He's doing push ups and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked with Dominic's head and that </v>

401
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.340
<v Speaker 3>was one of the things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking was like,</v>

402
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>this kid's been in a lot of street </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

403
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know if this trash talk is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to work on him the way it works on</v>

404
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 3>other guys.</v>

405
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fine in there like I asked them,</v>

406
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

407
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I feel calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

408
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 3>I know I can stay calm when that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

409
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's just like this young </v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry dude who,</v>

410
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.933
<v Speaker 3>he took it personal and a lot of guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>get real emotional and I was worried </v>

411
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:20.790
<v Speaker 3>that cody come out super emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get like taken down.</v>

412
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Just real emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like A.</v>

413
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.933
<v Speaker 3>Although David against me Gregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just forgets about his technique </v>

414
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 3>and rushes and gets marked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But dude,</v>

415
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 3>he just took all that and the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

416
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.153
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you name another performance like </v>

417
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:36.300
<v Speaker 3>that where a guy he remembered he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>even number one contenders,</v>

418
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 3>five or six in the world that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

419
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Was He a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I moved to six maybe,</v>

420
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.910
<v Speaker 3>but that might have been some </v>
<v Speaker 3>shenanigans.</v>

421
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.093
<v Speaker 3>Just who knows that the cheeto finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>rankings but still motherfucker went </v>

422
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 3>from five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six rank number one.</v>

423
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big strategy.</v>

424
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Handily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a Thompson one round.</v>

425
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

426
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.240
<v Speaker 3>and cody dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard him.</v>

427
00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:56.701
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

428
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 3>we still don't exactly know where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut came from.</v>

429
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Some people were saying it came from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>

430
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I heard people say online say came from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Kyc,</v>

431
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 3>definitely not drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guys in the trucks that it was a</v>

432
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.970
<v Speaker 3>headbutt truck boys were off because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard when they said that,</v>

433
00:19:07.971 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are they watch?</v>

434
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:09.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

435
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

436
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.170
<v Speaker 3>pulled it up for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard.</v>

437
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.250
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while the fights going on,</v>

438
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.173
<v Speaker 3>they'll do that and I'll tell me it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>headbutt and see I have two monitors in </v>

439
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:18.804
<v Speaker 3>front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've one right here and then I've won </v>

440
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>over the side and they'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look on monitor be,</v>

441
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll show it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't really.</v>

442
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to do that while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching the actual fight,</v>

443
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll show it to me and I usually,</v>

444
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:30.534
<v Speaker 3>I just take their word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but occasionally I think in the replay </v>

445
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:34.374
<v Speaker 3>that they showed and maybe they saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and it show the correct one </v>

446
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.670
<v Speaker 3>three play that they showed it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely wasn't a headbutt well,</v>

447
00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 3>they definitely did collide heads for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure for sure.</v>

448
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And so who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hard to tell,</v>

449
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 3>but who gives a fuck either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a big ass cut,</v>

450
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 3>big ass cut on Dom's eyebrow and he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

451
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 3>How good is dominick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cruz took a punch to but he gets in,</v>

452
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 3>he gets cracked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his legs go stiff.</v>

453
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:55.404
<v Speaker 3>He goes down and a couple of times cody </v>
<v Speaker 3>like acted almost like you wasn't going </v>

454
00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:00.014
<v Speaker 3>to follow him to the ground and and beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>on them on the ground and almost acted </v>

455
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 3>like he was done.</v>

456
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.773
<v Speaker 3>He was like calling them up or like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hunt kind of walk off caleb better </v>

457
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 3>get on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't even,</v>

458
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:09.954
<v Speaker 3>didn't even make an attempt to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe he doesn't want to have </v>

459
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 3>anything to do with the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he feels like that's where dominic</v>

460
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:17.890
<v Speaker 3>might have a chance to shut down their </v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

461
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what dominick Cruz wanting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to punish them to.</v>

462
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just how many crews have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>submissions?</v>

463
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz is really good on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

464
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hell yeah.</v>

465
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he have any submission?</v>

466
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:29.064
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has some missions for usually from </v>

467
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:30.744
<v Speaker 3>guillotines though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day was his Jujitsu is </v>

468
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>

469
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

470
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a black belt for sure.</v>

471
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him compete in tournaments and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

472
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.630
<v Speaker 3>any wrestled as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a wrestler for a guy not to go down</v>

473
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 3>in his guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some shit.</v>

474
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.180
<v Speaker 3>That's like some conor Mcgregor Diaz </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit were like,</v>

475
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can lose two easily down there.</v>

476
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.043
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might not have been that at </v>

477
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might have been even more simple.</v>

478
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a lost jamie naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

479
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 3>So he's got a rear naked there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got.</v>

480
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.330
<v Speaker 3>So he lost to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got one room naked guard.</v>

481
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.980
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well who knows,</v>

482
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 3>so you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still,</v>

483
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what he could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line was,</v>

484
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:10.744
<v Speaker 3>cody wanted to keep the fight standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just want to punish him and hit </v>

485
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.234
<v Speaker 3>him so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might've thought the fight was </v>

486
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

487
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 3>he seemed to have the answer for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominic.</v>

488
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean at least it worked for cody </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't or wasn't not.</v>

489
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm no stryker that he made dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to him and it's different when.</v>

490
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>

491
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

492
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but it's also you got to give credit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his teams.</v>

493
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:32.914
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin Buchholz and those guys had been </v>

494
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 3>imitating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fought dom so many times,</v>

495
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 3>six times and imitate his movements so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can mimic his shit.</v>

496
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:41.160
<v Speaker 3>So when they're sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do that,</v>

497
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.073
<v Speaker 3>that fake stuff that like false start </v>
<v Speaker 3>because dom does this thing where false </v>

498
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 3>starts and then he'd start and you never</v>
<v Speaker 3>know which one's going to be a kick,</v>

499
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 3>which I could see a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like patterns at dom throws up.</v>

500
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.913
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out how to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they mimicked and they watched him so </v>

501
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.274
<v Speaker 3>many times that they can get it down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a t and cody didn't bind into the </v>

502
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.580
<v Speaker 3>faints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll just like,</v>

503
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to come on,</v>

504
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.453
<v Speaker 3>come in within this range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he kept baiting him and they'd make </v>

505
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:06.410
<v Speaker 3>it count.</v>

506
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom line is if his brain's not </v>

507
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 3>confused and he just knows that in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>exchanges,</v>

508
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 3>dom's going to be there and he's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some,</v>

509
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got some really unpredictable </v>

510
00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dom does,</v>

511
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.880
<v Speaker 3>but he does like a bunch of things a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

512
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 3>And then commits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

513
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 3>And so he timed those things and caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with some fucking vicious punches,</v>

514
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:24.971
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

515
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:25.481
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

516
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't like dom fights a lot of guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

517
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Tucker movie gets hit in the face.</v>

518
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:31.594
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one y'all kicked me and you don't </v>

519
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 3>know where it's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just,</v>

520
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.423
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just garbage and just never bought </v>

521
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>

522
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.423
<v Speaker 3>wait for you to commit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do all that jazz and I'm just </v>

523
00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:43.160
<v Speaker 3>going to wait right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a guy's been boxed.</v>

524
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 3>And when he was real young talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>last night.</v>

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 32 and two amateur record.</v>

526
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:49.714
<v Speaker 3>You look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the UFC compared to other </v>

527
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:56.800
<v Speaker 3>fighters that boxing comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge.</v>

528
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 3>He was coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

529
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Cody was catching dominick Cruz on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way out.</v>

530
00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>which that's a lot of people don't catch</v>

531
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:06.270
<v Speaker 3>them on the way and never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

532
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.233
<v Speaker 3>he was catching them on the way up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed and precision of punching </v>

533
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glorious for five rounds and then people</v>

534
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 3>forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cody in high school,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think he was first team all state out </v>

536
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 3>of Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a big deal out there.</v>

537
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.160
<v Speaker 3>He had scholarships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>played division one or I'm sorry,</v>

538
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 3>compete in Division One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling was like,</v>

539
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:24.814
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to fight professionally </v>

540
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.203
<v Speaker 3>full time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what kind of stud you're dealing </v>

541
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:28.924
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His uncle was an alternate for the </v>

542
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:31.414
<v Speaker 3>Olympic boxing team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean he comes from a long line of </v>

543
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 3>just savages to pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it.</v>

546
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:44.251
<v Speaker 3>I wish that a fighter's appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science of boxing more.</v>

547
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 3>When GSP</v>

548
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 5>one of those fights he trained with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Freddie Roach and it came back with that</v>

549
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It made waves,</v>

550
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people didn't copy that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arloski did.</v>

551
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 5>First it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>wherever.</v>

574
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 5>Just focus on wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still work on your striking.</v>

575
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Go with Duane Ludwig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be awesome.</v>

576
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 5>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or Rafael Cordeiro mix it up,</v>

577
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.443
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to change shit up now </v>

578
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.420
<v Speaker 5>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

579
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 5>but wrestling should be the focus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you see a Rhonda Rousey Promo,</v>

580
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.220
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't see her getting mets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should see her shooting,</v>

581
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 5>getting the clench.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Double leg,</v>

582
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:14.300
<v Speaker 5>take down singles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be wrestling every day.</v>

583
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.700
<v Speaker 5>Twice a day for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But think about her camp,</v>

584
00:25:17.701 --> 00:25:20.000
<v Speaker 5>her whole camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a boxing gym.</v>

585
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.340
<v Speaker 5>Those are head coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a boxing coach.</v>

586
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 5>So they want her to be this boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People sold her as the next Mike Tyson.</v>

587
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 5>So you have all that come in.</v>

588
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.573
<v Speaker 5>And she was Merkin girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember I was on board till I'm like </v>

589
00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:31.281
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are striking.</v>

590
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 5>She's not going to bitches out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you start to the level.</v>

591
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:36.370
<v Speaker 5>It's like the devil she's knocking them </v>
<v Speaker 5>out at.</v>

592
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

593
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.571
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

594
00:25:37.571 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 5>I think the media and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

595
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Dang she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a knockout artists.</v>

596
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 5>So you hear those in her canceling your </v>
<v Speaker 5>knockout artists.</v>

597
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 5>You can strike with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

598
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 5>And her coach like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

599
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.533
<v Speaker 5>that was always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember when Gerald fought in the </v>

600
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Speaker 5>UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was always the case when Gerald is a.</v>

601
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 5>was he a black male back then or brown </v>
<v Speaker 5>belt?</v>

602
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 5>It was a brown belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really Good Jujitsu guy though,</v>

603
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 5>but his fucking striking coach had him </v>
<v Speaker 5>convinced that he was a boxer.</v>

604
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.713
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to go out there and get a </v>

605
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:03.854
<v Speaker 5>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I remember Eddie and I would train </v>

606
00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 5>them and watch them hit the bag and hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>the meds and stuff,</v>

607
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:08.594
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

608
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 5>there are some scary guys in the UFC.</v>

609
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 5>And he got a real scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Josh Thompson,</v>

610
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 5>Josh Thompson was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep,</v>

<v Speaker 5>nothing happening.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eve Edwards knocked him out.</v>

689
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eve Edwards became the uncrowned king.</v>

690
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 5>So this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So luckily,</v>

691
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.440
<v Speaker 5>and this is according to Josh Thompson </v>
<v Speaker 5>told me,</v>

692
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.413
<v Speaker 5>Josh goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

693
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.660
<v Speaker 5>I was so worried about a standing stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when we saw the fight,</v>

694
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 5>my whole thing was how do we know the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole.</v>

695
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.033
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing was for sure Josh </v>
<v Speaker 5>Thompson is not going to want to go to </v>

696
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 5>the ground with Gerald.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where all this good shit is.</v>

697
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:24.364
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking people up and NMA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All his fights up until the USC was </v>

698
00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:27.814
<v Speaker 5>fucking people up with the Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how are we going to get the fight to </v>

699
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 5>the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were thinking about pulling.</v>

700
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 5>How elaborate a unorthodox Cardpool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are we going to do it?</v>

701
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 5>That's what I was thinking like six </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

702
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he thinks he's Bangkok.</v>

703
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's six months,</v>

704
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.300
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

705
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.650
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

706
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.740
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Josh takes him down and I was sitting</v>

707
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:49.700
<v Speaker 5>there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck thing?</v>

708
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.063
<v Speaker 5>He takes a general dental because he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>so worried about his tie and Gerald d </v>

709
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 5>right away throws up a hell fire with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this guard.</v>

710
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 5>He threw a lot of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty bad ass to see,</v>

711
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 5>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first he almost had him in an arm bar.</v>

712
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Josh pulls out and then there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>scramble on the ground.</v>

713
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Gerald ghost for a leg lock because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>finally pulls out of his garden.</v>

714
00:31:13.701 --> 00:31:14.534
<v Speaker 5>Then general who was really good at like</v>
<v Speaker 5>locks and he went for a leg lock and </v>

715
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:19.630
<v Speaker 5>then Josh Thompson hit him like in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>back of the head and knocked him out.</v>

716
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.400
<v Speaker 5>Killer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of those.</v>

717
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of those going,</v>

718
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going into a box is risky.</v>

719
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.970
<v Speaker 5>What started this all off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bolded.</v>

720
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:29.963
<v Speaker 5>Those coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coaches get these fucking people </v>

721
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:35.680
<v Speaker 5>convinced that there's try killer in one</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular every camp though,</v>

722
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.514
<v Speaker 5>because in every campus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you have like a superstar </v>

723
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 5>camp and it does come from my own </v>
<v Speaker 5>personal experience,</v>

724
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 5>you have a superstar wrestling coach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing coach,</v>

725
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:45.484
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu coach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're spending your time with </v>

726
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:48.980

<v Speaker 5>They want to see you win with,</v>

727
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.100
<v Speaker 5>with their shit.</v>

728
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even coaches get tossed them off.</v>

729
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.063
<v Speaker 5>The W should be number fucking war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice when they win with some shit </v>

730
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fucked up.</v>

731
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 5>Like you showed me that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always good,</v>

732
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:06.440
<v Speaker 5>but it's all about the Goddamn w.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's number one.</v>

733
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.373
<v Speaker 5>You gotTa have like a head coach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to have a head coach that's not </v>

734
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 5>a striking coast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd you like a head coach?</v>

735
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 5>Matt Hume as a head coach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know like when he works with Dj,</v>

736
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 5>they do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

737
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 5>they work on submissions together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spar together.</v>

738
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:21.574
<v Speaker 5>He worked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they work on all these different </v>

739
00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.044
<v Speaker 5>techniques and it's total technique and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tactics oriented conversations in how </v>

740
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 5>many other though in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like five one.</v>

741
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 5>His hat is honestly this like in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind,</v>

742
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:35.770
<v Speaker 5>it's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he's not number one,</v>

743
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 5>it's him and for us a hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I count two that can do it all,</v>

744
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 5>that really</v>

745
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.033
<v Speaker 3>know the game in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can do a game plan from standing to </v>

746
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>restroom to grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

747
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the one guy might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>better for you.</v>

748
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:49.750
<v Speaker 3>One guy might be better for the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are the.</v>

749
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.623
<v Speaker 3>Those are the top dogs too because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's such wizards on the ground are </v>

750
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 3>wizards to it and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could physically do it too.</v>

751
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 3>That's like a big part of it and plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that transition.</v>

752
00:32:58.641 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes if you go to a pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu guy,</v>

753
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

754
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 3>this isn't gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I commit both hands this,</v>

755
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:04.964
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to blast in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember what George Greer Gel </v>

756
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu</v>

757
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:10.400
<v Speaker 3>back when there was very few black </v>
<v Speaker 3>belts,</v>

758
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:11.234
<v Speaker 3>but then he became.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to stand and bang with </v>

759
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:14.260
<v Speaker 3>everybody and that was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

760
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Became this thing standing in banging </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>

761
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>That happens so often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

762
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy and it's so rare that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy comes back and figures it out.</v>

763
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:23.924
<v Speaker 3>Like Damien Maia House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia tried it that way for </v>

764
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

765
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.670
<v Speaker 3>You got sucked into it and they figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended up with Rhonda.</v>

766
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Should they took it to what says </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

767
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.800
<v Speaker 3>You go to the dance or what took you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the express?</v>

768
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.523
<v Speaker 3>I know what happens is a lot of early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show a lot of high level Jujitsu guys </v>

769
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:46.290
<v Speaker 3>come into the UFC that the hands a Mensa</v>
<v Speaker 3>mense yeah.</v>

770
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like a three striking and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>never evolved to that.</v>

771
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Now fucking striking is evolving quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>

772
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be that the only guys,</v>

773
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.013
<v Speaker 3>the only black belts that got to the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like the guys that were only </v>

774
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 3>dedicated their lives to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get to.</v>

775
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.340
<v Speaker 3>They just started learning and striking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell upon,</v>

776
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 3>you can tell like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

777
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 3>they're just trying to fucking get some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

778
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now with,</v>

779
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 3>there's so many goddamn black belts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil now that it's not about.</v>

780
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 3>It's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's 100 black belts in the camp.</v>

782
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>We're only going to take the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>strikers.</v>

783
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Like the fierce ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the guy,</v>

784
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 3>the days of pure Jujitsu guys coming out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking like this,</v>

785
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.980
<v Speaker 3>that there are long gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

786
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through the minor leagues.</v>

787
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way like that.</v>

788
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Your attitude is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this</v>

789
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like my forestry isn't combat.</v>

790
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.273
<v Speaker 6>I didn't write shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would just go up on stage and do that </v>

791
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:48.630
<v Speaker 6>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit to live in.</v>

792
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was 50 slash 50.</v>

793
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 6>What do you do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do this.</v>

794
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 6>I got really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I couldn't make a living doing that.</v>

795
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:58.783
<v Speaker 6>If I'm bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could fall back to that shit and rock </v>

796
00:35:00.691 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Speaker 6>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't work that muscle anymore.</v>

797
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I first started comedy,</v>

798
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 6>I had to go on stage every Tuesday and </v>
<v Speaker 6>further the same fucking people.</v>

799
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.480
<v Speaker 6>So you had to write a new five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For two years I did that.</v>

800
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 6>There was some weeks I couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I just decided just to improvise.</v>

801
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.383
<v Speaker 6>I got so good at improvising and by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time I got to Seattle and started </v>

802
00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.390
<v Speaker 6>featuring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was really good improvised.</v>

803
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.233
<v Speaker 6>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you saying about how does this </v>

804
00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:27.944
<v Speaker 6>equate to fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't improvise no more because I got </v>

805
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.794
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you first met me at the store 15 </v>

806
00:35:33.201 --> 00:35:34.034
<v Speaker 6>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go onstage and do seven minutes </v>

807
00:35:35.721 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 6>of material and the rest of it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>improvised.</v>

808
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

809
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 3>They will sheet and when it works it </v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

810
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 3>When it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty good at it.</v>

811
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I could really improvise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

812
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Do I still do it today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

813
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 3>because you have to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could fall back on the dog.</v>

814
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I could fall back on my wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my wrestling.</v>

815
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.483
<v Speaker 3>That's my pedigree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When me and you will feel when I call </v>

816
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 3>you and I make you laugh on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that.</v>

817
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I didn't call you with a script when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>call you.</v>

818
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a script.</v>

819
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:07.290
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you drive and getting excited,</v>

820
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got that pedigree.</v>

821
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I could rock that pedigree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that pedigree isn't going to take me</v>

822
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:12.774
<v Speaker 3>to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to sit and you have to write </v>

823
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.230
<v Speaker 3>and you have to evolve different things.</v>

824
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 3>So I think that when I'm a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

825
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this since I was 18.</v>

826
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm 31 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've won Abu Dhabi.</v>

827
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abu Dhabi?</v>

828
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>GIP and Americans.</v>

829
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.260
<v Speaker 3>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got these.</v>

830
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two different styles of winters.</v>

831
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.763
<v Speaker 3>There's the all around the guy like Dj </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a guy like Anderson </v>

832
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Silva that really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might submit people,</v>

833
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:42.800
<v Speaker 3>but it's so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he submitted chell center,</v>

834
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like Chael Sonnen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave it to him.</v>

835
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

836
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 3>that fucking armbar triangle combination</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't even locked in.</v>

837
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

838
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:52.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kinda over the calf a little.</v>

839
00:36:52.561 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't clamped down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe chair was so exhausted that</v>

840
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 3>he had a tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But honestly,</v>

841
00:36:57.811 --> 00:36:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>

842
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 3>He was pretty honest about having mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdowns in fights.</v>

843
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.933
<v Speaker 3>He did it with a polo female members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing on the Anderson Silva fight </v>

844
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:07.661
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said going in,</v>

845
00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 3>he and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm gonna get submitted.</v>

846
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm get submitted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he was taking down,</v>

847
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 3>he's in this guide for like three </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

848
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 3>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a matter of time.</v>

849
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 3>He's going to catch me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to catch it again.</v>

850
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand this in silver.</v>

851
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.733
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had been submitted a few times in </v>

852
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 3>fights that he was winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is.</v>

853
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is,</v>

854
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Anderson's never been like a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu guy.</v>

855
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.270
<v Speaker 3>He's a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tapped out Dan Henderson,</v>

856
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.460
<v Speaker 3>wherever that will beat the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him before.</v>

857
00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 3>But he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a beautiful tape was.</v>

858
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did get his back and choking him out.</v>

859
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Disagree with you on that triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That triangle was legitimate.</v>

860
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.953
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a trial versus a Anderson Silva </v>

861
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

862
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't fully locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a little bit of space.</v>

863
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.603
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be fully felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how much you're squeezing </v>

864
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:57.400
<v Speaker 3>it lead curling's true end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has long legs,</v>

865
00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 3>so due to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

866
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To Joe's point is exhausted guy,</v>

867
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 3>but my point is Anderson Silva is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn specialist.</v>

868
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 3>His specialty is more tie in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially as striking.</v>

869
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 3>When you look at Anderson Silva's </v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight reels,</v>

870
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.620
<v Speaker 3>is that front kick to the face on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vittorio?</v>

871
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 3>It's that fucking need of the body down </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Bond and that's his gift.</v>

872
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 3>I care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is them at this point.</v>

873
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 3>This is a gel at a beautiful double,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't he?</v>

874
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 3>He drove it so hard on that double.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes him down.</v>

875
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Should he fights in a couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the fourth round.</v>

876
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.680
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to the end of the flight.</v>

877
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see this.</v>

878
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.910
<v Speaker 3>This we're child stands up and sits </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

879
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.750
<v Speaker 3>That's tight as fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

880
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.673
<v Speaker 3>That's tight as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's titus as a lot tighter than I </v>

881
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:44.080
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

882
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:44.914
<v Speaker 3>when he finally got the arms are opened </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the line because he looked like he </v>

883
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.750
<v Speaker 3>was about to swing the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

884
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back then.</v>

885
00:38:50.601 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tight right there.</v>

886
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 3>That's tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it back.</v>

887
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:54.874
<v Speaker 3>Chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he,</v>

888
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 3>right when he gets the arm is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when he opens up.</v>

889
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a different thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an arm bar.</v>

890
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

891
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.900
<v Speaker 3>So my point being like the best guys at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one particular thing are pretty rare,</v>

892
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.193
<v Speaker 3>like the guys like an Anderson that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so elite at striking that nobody </v>

893
00:39:13.171 --> 00:39:14.004
<v Speaker 3>wants to strike with them or it got like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia solely to Jujitsu that he </v>

894
00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:19.800
<v Speaker 3>makes guys like Carlos Condit look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea what they're doing.</v>

895
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.710
<v Speaker 3>He gets you on the ground and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a little white pill.</v>

896
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.020
<v Speaker 3>But so there's that kind of guy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do that.</v>

897
00:39:25.021 --> 00:39:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Or there's a guy like mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse.</v>

898
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Although he's got really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>submissions,</v>

899
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.733
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to see that style and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be able to submit the </v>

900
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:36.900
<v Speaker 3>best Jujitsu guys in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 25 pounds,</v>

901
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.140
<v Speaker 3>most likely in a Jew Jitsu match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia probably could,</v>

902
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.363
<v Speaker 3>you know Damien Maia has the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>to beat pretty much anybody he rolls </v>

903
00:39:44.581 --> 00:39:47.040
<v Speaker 3>with on the Mat and an actual straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>up Jujitsu match.</v>

904
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.873
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have two different styles you have </v>

905
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:50.344
<v Speaker 3>like that style of winter which has </v>
<v Speaker 3>never won the title and there's only a </v>

906
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.580
<v Speaker 3>few guys like Anderson that have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

907
00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Anderson in all due fairness,</v>

908
00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:58.943
<v Speaker 3>he wanted like what in 2005 was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when Anderson somewhere around there in </v>

909
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:05.900
<v Speaker 3>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

910
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 3>That's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might as well be 30 years ago.</v>

911
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a totally different class of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>

912
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.760
<v Speaker 3>This evolution of the game is so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like four years ago,</v>

913
00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:18.450
<v Speaker 3>we're in leather helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would love to watch tyron woodley</v>

914
00:40:18.451 --> 00:40:20.130
<v Speaker 3>versus Demian Maia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>

915
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I would love to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be incredible.</v>

916
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.420
<v Speaker 3>That to me is maybe one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting fights on the horizon for me</v>

917
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:27.263
<v Speaker 3>so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia has been able to take down </v>

918
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:29.634
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers that he's been able to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>them all down like easy and just the </v>

919
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:36.740
<v Speaker 3>beautiful technique and a black kid do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

920
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.550
<v Speaker 3>That would lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go.</v>

921
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go through the storm.</v>

922
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.220
<v Speaker 3>The storm of fucking meteors coming your</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

923
00:40:44.221 --> 00:40:45.054
<v Speaker 3>The Woodley drops on you because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most dangerous in that first round </v>

924
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.633
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're closing the distance on them and </v>

925
00:40:53.071 --> 00:40:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you haven't figured out how fast he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet because he's not.</v>

926
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.350
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't hit hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking fast.</v>

927
00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.710
<v Speaker 3>I saw some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

928
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.410
<v Speaker 3>just rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

929
00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:05.570
<v Speaker 3>But a big thing was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and Woodley agreeing to a super fund</v>

930
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:07.590
<v Speaker 3>at one 80.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

931
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Bisbee and Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

932
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.360
<v Speaker 3>When did they agree to this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

933
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

934
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:17.040
<v Speaker 3>you see woodland bisbing want to do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cathaway that one 80.</v>

935
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting fight.</v>

936
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.000
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can bisping make that healthy?</v>

937
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was thinking because </v>
<v Speaker 3>five's the tough cut for him.</v>

938
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he used to fight two?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

939
00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:26.730
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

943

<v Speaker 3>what would the want is that big payday?</v>

944

<v Speaker 3>Mike Bisbee and tyrone Woodley.</v>

947
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Agree to catch weight about this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit.</v>

948
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 3>So it just happened today on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>payday.</v>

956
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.120
<v Speaker 3>He wants the biggest thing possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get paid.</v>

957
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

958
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:07.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

959
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Anderson back.</v>

960
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that has been still been calling for</v>

961
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:11.804
<v Speaker 3>a rematch with bisbing too because his </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight with bisping so fucking close in </v>

962
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 3>England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he feels like he beat him.</v>

963
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the craziest situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hits him with that flying knee.</v>

964
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

965
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:23.900
<v Speaker 3>bisping was out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went out,</v>

966
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 3>he dropped and Anderson does a walk off </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale and they go,</v>

967
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so quick.</v>

968
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.740

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does that make get a video of that?</v>

970
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Because remember [inaudible] being takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a break because his mouthpiece falls out</v>

971
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.440
<v Speaker 3>and he's like talking to the ref and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nancy goes,</v>

972
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.520

<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

973
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.340
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

974
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.173
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to get the referees </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and Anderson Flying Nita and </v>

<v Speaker 3>So did that flying knee.</v>

976
00:42:49.081 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 3>That's why the ref was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold up.</v>

977
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't look at that.</v>

978
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 3>That's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stitching box his fucking face off.</v>

979
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.270

<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

982
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was also the end of the round two,</v>

983
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:04.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

984
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

985
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this again.</v>

986
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:08.481
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

987
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:12.470
<v Speaker 3>let me get my mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

988
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look at this.</v>

989
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is such a crazy drop to the way you</v>

990
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 3>get hit thrown the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regardless whether he looked to the side</v>

991
00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:24.194
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would have thrown it </v>

992
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:27.680
<v Speaker 3>regardless and it wasn't like bisbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>put his hands down.</v>

993
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 3>He looked over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was still covered up.</v>

994
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Here's the moment that I think he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little distracted there for sure.</v>

995
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.493
<v Speaker 3>Here's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pittsburgh comes back and wins that </v>

996
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 3>fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Face off.</v>

997
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 3>How's you when that actually comes out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think that was the third round,</v>

998
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:41.444
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes out that fourth round and I </v>

999
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 3>knocked his his face off crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a kangaroo crazy recovery.</v>

1000
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.080
<v Speaker 3>That means unbelieved cardiovert insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:43:50.081 --> 00:43:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Because most people get hit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1002
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean his body shut off and he dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1003
00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 3>the power of give us a second June and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're back.</v>

1004
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Partially blind in one eye or </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>

1005
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Partially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.233
<v Speaker 3>but he could still see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can see enough where they let them </v>

1007
00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:09.520
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean he does those dye tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to do.</v>

1009
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:12.404
<v Speaker 3>I test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently what they did is they put </v>

1010
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:14.324
<v Speaker 3>some kind of oil in his eye and that oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>like protects his retina somehow or </v>

1011
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 3>another and that's why it looks so crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once he's done fighting then they'll</v>

1012
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.084
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is like if he gets it </v>

1013
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 3>fixed now and then he goes and fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and tears it even worse.</v>

1014
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing is the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>time he waits more advanced,</v>

1015
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 3>all the stem cell shit is getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

1016
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 3>they brought someone's vision back with </v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cells.</v>

1017
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Sign guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was blind and they injected stem</v>

1018
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:43.540
<v Speaker 3>cells and this guy's eye and brought his</v>
<v Speaker 3>vision back then.</v>

1019
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017.</v>

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.783
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping does not have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary physical attributes and </v>

1032
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 3>not that he's not a great athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He certainly is not.</v>

1033
00:45:16.261 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 3>He's done a very good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's certainly as cardio.</v>

1034
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at a guy like rumble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary physical attributes,</v>

1035

<v Speaker 3>And a close decision for this book was a</v>

1064
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:40.323
<v Speaker 3>fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You forget about that fight when you </v>

1065
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:44.460

<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Something I had a funny feeling about </v>

1071
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:01.824
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luke was taking it seriously I think </v>

<v Speaker 3>four days and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he already beat bisping two fucking </v>

1073

<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it needs is one shot,</v>

1074
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.443
<v Speaker 3>but business name and knockout artists </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the bedding off for him to knock </v>

<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold on the first round.</v>

1076
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something,</v>

1077
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:21.654

<v Speaker 3>telling the story,</v>

1082
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.380

<v Speaker 3>was a beautiful left hook.</v>

1091
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.073
<v Speaker 3>He stepped in with it and just whipped </v>
<v Speaker 3>it over the top and it was something </v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a quiet guy in terms of what?</v>

1098
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.530
<v Speaker 3>He's not out there trying to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of publicity.</v>

1099
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:24.360
<v Speaker 3>He's not a attention whore is just an </v>

<v Speaker 3>gasoline fight.</v>

1111
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.203
<v Speaker 3>The Calvin gasoline fight was the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight that he worked with Duke roufus </v>

1112
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.780
<v Speaker 3>and he was trying to figure out if he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go to att off.</v>

1113
00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 3>He's got to work with Duke roufus that </v>
<v Speaker 3>att before his son.</v>

1114
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never had like a head coach.</v>

1115
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 3>You go down there and do a camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1116
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:13.510
<v Speaker 3>was he thinking just talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talented and just figuring it out on his</v>

1117
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:14.344
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son told him to go to Chicago or </v>

1118
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Milwaukee rather held to such a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

1119
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 3>Told him he had the idea that his dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>

1120
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.733
<v Speaker 3>You should go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1121
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.481
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1122
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:26.314
<v Speaker 3>it was 15 below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got My fucking car and drove to </v>

1123
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then looked at him and he won.</v>

1124
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.250
<v Speaker 3>He beat Calvin and then he's won every </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight since then.</v>

1125
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:34.680
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title this day and age,</v>

1126
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you have to have that head coach.</v>

1127
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.000
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have all bases covered.</v>

1128
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Does another guy be distracted with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1129
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Speaker 3>You can't be doing this over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't live here.</v>

1130
00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:43.954
<v Speaker 3>Then flying just for your camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't decide to get serious six </v>

1131
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 3>weeks before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are too good,</v>

1132
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 3>but how can you imagine that the NFL did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1133
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:51.663
<v Speaker 3>Tom Brady was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this even though I'm in </v>

1134
00:49:53.501 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then right before training camp starts,</v>

1135
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:57.340
<v Speaker 3>so I'm gonna get serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't.</v>

1136
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.930
<v Speaker 3>You just can't man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 3>and Duke's another guy that doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough credit because he's another guy.</v>

1138
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:02.584
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty quiet like Duke roufus is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not out there trying to make a lot of </v>

1139
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 3>noise and get a lot of people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to him.</v>

1140
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just an awesome striking coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing strength coach.</v>

1141
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.493
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason why maybe he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get enough credit with the Woodley's </v>

1142
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.500
<v Speaker 3>because what's going on with pedals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only reason badasses in a </v>

1144
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 3>weird state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How man?</v>

1145
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't fight at 1:45.</v>

1146
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:23.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just too weak for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just can't take it.</v>

1147
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.200
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watch that fight and it's like,</v>

1148
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.073
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Holloway just beat the fuck out of </v>

1149
00:50:27.111 --> 00:50:27.944
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like</v>

1150
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't get why you went to 45 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>is lost at 55.</v>

1151
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talking about split decision,</v>

1152
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 1>the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that bad.</v>

1153
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 1>You obviously can compete in the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>five there.</v>

1154
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.913
<v Speaker 1>He definitely competed and could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go the full distance while </v>

1155
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas at 45,</v>

1156
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:46.540
<v Speaker 1>his body was breaking down and he even </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1157
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.393
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything in my power to make </v>

1158
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.004
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just my body shut down on it to tell </v>

1159
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you guys maybe he should just go fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

1160
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Just start strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1161
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Start fucking doing dead lifts and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be beef his body up.</v>

1162
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at dos Anjos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Dasan Joe's before.</v>

1163
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Habib number got that off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's also hundreds afterwards.</v>

1164
00:51:06.571 --> 00:51:07.740
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you saw it?</v>

1165
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw johnny who you are,</v>

1166
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.413
<v Speaker 1>who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is absolutely a difference </v>

1167
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 1>when a guy gets on a serious strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conditioning routine,</v>

1168
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 1>regardless of Mexican supplements.</v>

1169
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 1>He went with Nickerson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nickerson.</v>

1170
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen the videos of Hockfield?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos?</v>

1171
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Anjos and curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on doing work.</v>

1172
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Curse on is a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has guys doing crazy shit.</v>

1173
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.170
<v Speaker 1>He's got you doing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Marinovich Shit.</v>

1174
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Well you got all this footwork stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes in like foot strength.</v>

1175
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all plyometrics,</v>

1176
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.163
<v Speaker 1>all these explosive box jumps and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this crazy fucking burpees and </v>

1177
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.230
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

1178
00:51:44.231 --> 00:51:48.550
<v Speaker 1>the nutty explosive sprinting back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth because for one,</v>

1179
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.633
<v Speaker 1>I love that Meta chick for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Carlos Condo is a climate on </v>

1180
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.203
<v Speaker 1>trees and shit and fucking connor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all this weird stuff and then all </v>

1181
00:51:58.221 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden just the meat head movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>is back the meat head movement.</v>

1182
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that?</v>

1183
00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 1>That training is not a meathead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say.</v>

1184
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that meat head movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

1185
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1186
00:52:07.971 --> 00:52:08.211
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1187
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:11.060
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that that raw power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that strength condition,</v>

1188
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:11.894
<v Speaker 1>you can't make up for that by climbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on trees and doing this weird yoga </v>

1189
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit.</v>

1190
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 1>There's room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all good.</v>

1191
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 1>But you got your focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking focus.</v>

1192
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.830
<v Speaker 1>But Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what what?</v>

1193
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:23.783
<v Speaker 1>What Connor's been able to do is develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>like extremely agile back and forth </v>

1194
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 1>movement and I think a lot of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ido portal guy.</v>

1195
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I got to admit that is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As his stuff looks,</v>

1196
00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:38.330
<v Speaker 1>when he's flipping around and doing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these jumps,</v>

1197
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.403
<v Speaker 1>if you can move your body like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to directly translate into </v>

1198
00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:45.560
<v Speaker 1>your footwork and your movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd give more credit to his head coach.</v>

1199
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent mean John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Wisdom it.</v>

1200
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of that use to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know who the biggest winner is?</v>

1201
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor.</v>

1202
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>How so he's the only star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1203
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 1>He's the only mega stone goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets all the stock.</v>

1204
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.480
<v Speaker 1>You fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fell as you want to talk.</v>

1205
00:52:59.481 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm the only guy left.</v>

1206
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:02.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

1207
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:03.223
<v Speaker 1>Hits that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next paper view is Holly </v>

1208
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Holm versus a Germane to Rhonda May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

1209
00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would buy it as a hardcore fan,</v>

1210
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.450
<v Speaker 1>but for sure for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll probably,</v>

1211
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

1212
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1213
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It ain't going to be Connor Mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

1215
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1216
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Bottom line comment when she lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure he likes Rhonda by,</v>

1217
00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.820
<v Speaker 3>but business wise he's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

1218
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1219
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.963
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a tricky situation now with the </v>

1220
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:38.424
<v Speaker 3>marketing campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dumb yet wme wme put together for </v>

<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why she's my fighter of the year.</v>

1234
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 3>She retired Nisha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she retired.</v>

1235
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda if Rhonda retires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's huge.</v>

1236
00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:16.170
<v Speaker 3>She retired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both of them.</v>

1237
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.560

<v Speaker 3>but she got caught in an arm bar.</v>

1247

<v Speaker 3>She beat her down the third round.</v>

1249
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Cat got on top and started blasting her </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she kinda gas.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's your number.</v>

1261
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.310

1262
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 3>her husband committed suicide and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this diabetes was that.</v>

1263
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.500
<v Speaker 3>That was after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

1264
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.310
<v Speaker 3>That was the virus afterwards was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>play that again,</v>

1265
00:55:34.311 --> 00:55:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Jamie plays out again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this shit.</v>

1266
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 3>But to answer your question from before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to interrupt you,</v>

1267
00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 3>this sitting on a goldmine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Morris now with this fuck Amanda</v>

1268
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.983
<v Speaker 3>Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you last night she spotted the </v>

1269
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 3>lbgt community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack fucking pockets.</v>

1270
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>LBTG.</v>

1271
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:12.620
<v Speaker 3>It's Lbgtq a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now listen,</v>

1272
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.350
<v Speaker 3>what does that got to keep up lesbians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how churches.</v>

1273
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.640
<v Speaker 3>One lottery ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just hit the fucking lottery thing.</v>

1274
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>ASEXUALS are in there today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carmouche before</v>

1275
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.933
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it still wasn't the champion work </v>

1276
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 1>once you're the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the champion.</v>

1277
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when Liz carmouche fought Ronda,</v>

1278
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 1>she fought her at the first fight when </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew who Ronda was.</v>

1279
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So Rhonda has all this hype behind her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wins that fight and then goes on.</v>

1280
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know Liz has done well in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

1281
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>but having that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

1282
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Tony Evans says she has her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor,</v>

1283
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>she's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen her fight?</v>

1284
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Tony Evans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very tough.</v>

1285
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.290
<v Speaker 1>She is bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's an eviction.</v>

1286
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Super tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really good.</v>

1287
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 1>And she's openly gay too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what way does she?</v>

1288
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 1>She's hilarious man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that chick.</v>

1289
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 1>She's like 1:35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:35,</v>

1290
00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:08.310
<v Speaker 1>1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's good.</v>

1291
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:09.603
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says the same thing we were talking </v>

1292
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 1>about like when Anderson was in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime,</v>

1293
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.890
<v Speaker 1>when he was just a light and people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1294
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.350
<v Speaker 1>The division was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't,</v>

1295
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to like Patrick [inaudible].</v>

1296
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He had a couple of fights for the title </v>
<v Speaker 1>palace.</v>

1297
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Latus real like there's no one frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no rich.</v>

1298
00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:24.934
<v Speaker 1>Franklin was the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no overwhelming need to see </v>

1299
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:30.280
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1300
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to see the fight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in.</v>

1301
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick's got a great chin,</v>

1302
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>he's got power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens.</v>

1303
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1304
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:37.834
<v Speaker 1>here's the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like cody garbrandt fighting </v>

1305
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 1>dominick Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

1306
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:42.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happened to us.</v>

1307
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:43.803
<v Speaker 1>There was no one like that for Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long ass time and I think in the </v>

1308
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 1>women's bantamweight division you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of similar situation.</v>

1309
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like now you have Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who beats the shit out of Misha.</v>

1310
00:57:54.901 --> 00:57:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Misha is going to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gone now.</v>

1311
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 1>She beats the shit out of a Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda steps back.</v>

1312
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Holly goes up to 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>remainder random.</v>

1313
00:58:04.291 --> 00:58:05.124
<v Speaker 1>Ain't got to change that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why fight for both belts to save that </v>

1314
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:11.710
<v Speaker 1>card?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

1315
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean let's make some moves because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've seen the car window,</v>

1316
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 1>the cop man holly's car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was the headliner?</v>

1317
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.023
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly's fighting Germane to random may </v>

1318
00:58:20.121 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 1>for the 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

1319
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I think they should give Jermaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>

1320
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You may thousand dollars a has already </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat her,</v>

1321
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.393
<v Speaker 1>but you know they need a new lesbian who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Nunez Nunez already beat </v>

1322
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She beat her in the UFC.</v>

1323
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.593
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine is a wicked kickboxer her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a world world class multiple time </v>

1324
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 1>world champion kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's,</v>

1325
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I think she won the Moitai world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moy Tai try titles several occasions.</v>

1326
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:52.411
<v Speaker 1>She's like really elite as a Meu Thai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'd gloves stand up,</v>

1327
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.060
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no ground.</v>

1328
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:55.894
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as she got in the UFC you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see like that transition between </v>

1329
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the striking with uh,</v>

1330
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:02.833
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with take downs versus just fighting </v>

1331
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big transition.</v>

1332
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:07.024
<v Speaker 1>Takes time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to people who </v>

1333
00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to give you the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1334
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:10.864
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking shooting out on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and beating her up and taking her down </v>

1335
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different sport.</v>

1336
00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought the card is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in Brooklyn.</v>

1337
00:59:17.351 --> 00:59:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Browne is fight.</v>

1338
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting fight.</v>

1339
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 1>But what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

1340
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 3>what is true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's Travis has head out right now?</v>

1341
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 3>He's training the same camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't he?</v>

1342
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

1343
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Travis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1344
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm versus Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight right there.</v>

1345
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1346
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:35.220
<v Speaker 3>I think at 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 3>lights will do that at this.</v>

1347
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.400
<v Speaker 3>For this card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1348
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Make It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make Amanda the two belt champion.</v>

1349
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to remember the </v>
<v Speaker 3>volunteership Shevchenko just beat holly</v>

1350
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 3>and Peter's come up 10 losses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1351
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:50.201
<v Speaker 3>And Valentino beat her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand up together.</v>

1352
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need help with this car.</v>

1353
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:55.310
<v Speaker 3>The problem is most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1354
00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 3>volunteer one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know who she is yet,</v>

1355
00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:58.933
<v Speaker 3>even though she won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she needs a few more victories </v>

1356
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:03.730
<v Speaker 3>inside the UFC in order to get people </v>
<v Speaker 3>excited about this paper.</v>

1357
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brooklyn.</v>

1358
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.510
<v Speaker 3>The only reason people know holly too is</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know the.</v>

1359
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Her past losses really?</v>

1360
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.840
<v Speaker 3>They granted her fight was on Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all they know is she's the girl that</v>

1361
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.270
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's selling this.</v>

1362
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.143
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You trying to say that this isn't going </v>

1363
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:15.704
<v Speaker 3>to get your last 60 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that I will illegally </v>

1364
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 3>streamed the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez just Vod for 45 seconds.</v>

1365
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 3>She's fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have her headline.</v>

1366
01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 3>That car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Man,</v>

1367
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:26.900
<v Speaker 3>let's build her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the.</v>

1368
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Where's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the superbowl card?</v>

1369
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Can't I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

1370
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's February.</v>

1371
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1372
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Bowl weekend is in Houston.</v>

1373
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Different Card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1374
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:42.170

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1375
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:45.080
<v Speaker 3>he's totally changed in one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have that card locked</v>

1376
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:45.914
<v Speaker 3>up either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1377
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.963
<v Speaker 3>I think there's still moving fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>around for that Brooklyn Card because I </v>

1378
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:50.054
<v Speaker 3>think they recognize that they did need </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more juice on that card in </v>

1379
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.124
<v Speaker 3>Vegas this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in Houston this year and the suit </v>

1380
01:00:57.771 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 3>bulge and he she or is it a problem?</v>

1381
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Houston or Dallas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>

1382
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Downs is a Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>

1383
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a,</v>

1384
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 3>they'll have a big card for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1385
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:11.040
<v Speaker 3>for the UFC there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a great.</v>

1386
01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Now is Bermudez and chance on John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good fight.</v>

1387
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a day is that?</v>

01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 5>they're all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That does happen,</v>

1486
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.353
<v Speaker 5>but it's only the Halloween party and </v>
<v Speaker 5>their fourth of July or a midnight </v>

1487
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:04.291
<v Speaker 5>summer's eve possible to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when we'd see fights?</v>

1488
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:09.391
<v Speaker 5>There was fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The strikeforce bottleneck to attach.</v>

1489
01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:11.894
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a tough loss and it's probably </v>

1490
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 5>over in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 5>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He looked terrible on the ground,</v>

1492
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1493
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 5>He was making big rookie mistakes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>super amateur.</v>

1494
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just like he was.</v>

1495
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.290
<v Speaker 5>He was like leaving himself open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't patient.</v>

1496
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you saw them in the gym,</v>

1497
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go home.</v>

1498
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I've seen me as the best in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1499
01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Like this motherfucker's going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1500
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:31.503
<v Speaker 5>So what is it a commitment to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling commitment to grappling </v>

1501
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 5>commitment to a Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1502
01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.340
<v Speaker 5>me just so good at standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1503
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.333
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his dad's this legend in Denver as far </v>

1504
01:06:40.571 --> 01:06:41.404
<v Speaker 5>as striking and he was a taekwondo guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he trained him since he was little </v>

1505
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 5>and Thatcher was always the it factor in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gym where you're like,</v>

1506
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.430
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're staying with him,</v>

1507
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:50.950
<v Speaker 5>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could do it all both ways.</v>

1508
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can mimic anything.</v>

1509
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.850
<v Speaker 5>He looked good standing up to man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>

1510
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.410
<v Speaker 5>But he made the mistake of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of initiating the grappling.</v>

1511
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.733
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ and what hurts him even </v>

1512
01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:03.034
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you guys saw this with </v>

1513
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:05.870
<v Speaker 5>all the chaos going on with UFC two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh seven.</v>

1514
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Their head coach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaster Bolin who was my head coach,</v>

1515
01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:09.454
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the best in the game </v>

1516
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:12.820
<v Speaker 5>is retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's leaving a Mussel farm.</v>

1517
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Why is he doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because his kids,</v>

1518
01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:16.970
<v Speaker 5>his kids in wrestling and he lives far </v>
<v Speaker 5>away and he's like,</v>

1519
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 5>don't spend too much time with the guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>traveling stuff.</v>

1520
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.820
<v Speaker 5>That was in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had three weekends with my kids.</v>

1521
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:23.020
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't do it.</v>

1522
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.033
<v Speaker 5>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

1523
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:24.963
<v Speaker 5>his son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little easters like really getting </v>

1524
01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:28.330
<v Speaker 5>competitive and wrestling and leasers </v>
<v Speaker 5>his wrestling coach.</v>

1525
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 5>How far away does he live from the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can our.</v>

1526
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.270
<v Speaker 5>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should move closer to fuck.</v>

1527
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1528
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:36.463
<v Speaker 5>because he owns his own business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He makes crazy money so he's just doing </v>

1529
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 5>it and it Kinda got out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1530
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:41.944
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm spending too much time with the </v>

1531
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:43.840
<v Speaker 5>team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of time with my family.</v>

1532
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:45.460
<v Speaker 5>He's a good dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the best.</v>

1533
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:46.690
<v Speaker 5>Really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the best.</v>

1534
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.733
<v Speaker 5>Very smart too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you what I'd like to see and I </v>

1535
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.393
<v Speaker 5>have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they've talked about so </v>

1536
01:07:51.181 --> 01:07:53.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'd like to see Matt Brown take kind</v>

1537
01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:57.580
<v Speaker 5>of a leadership role with that team </v>
<v Speaker 5>really and move that into the next phase</v>

1538
01:07:57.581 --> 01:07:59.650
<v Speaker 5>of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if he's into it.</v>

1539
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.890
<v Speaker 5>I've seen him with the guys and with his</v>
<v Speaker 5>mentality and experience.</v>

1540
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about a coach kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows it all.</v>

1541
01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Like we were talking about with Matt </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hume,</v>

1542
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:09.460
<v Speaker 5>who's been there be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea if he's even into it.</v>

1543
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was interesting because Dwayne was </v>

1544
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 5>working with Matt Brown for this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He work with them for a few weeks,</v>

1545
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 5>but I thought maybe</v>

1546
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.993
<v Speaker 3>we'd see more like footwork and movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Matt that's like similar to Dwayne </v>

1547
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.550
<v Speaker 3>style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dwayne style doesn't work that way.</v>

1548
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.443
<v Speaker 3>Duane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be in and you have to spend </v>

1549
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 3>a ton of time with them and I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>think he's the perfect coach for Tj,</v>

1550
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.540
<v Speaker 3>but unless you're one of those small </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys with that crazy footwork,</v>

1551
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.950
<v Speaker 3>he's not a guy who can go to for six </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and pick shit up.</v>

1552
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what man,</v>

1553
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:36.704
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you remember when Travis Browne </v>

1554
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 3>was first on the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he fought a skyscraper?</v>

1555
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Any funny mood like Dominick Cruz at </v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance.</v>

1556
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The entire division was like,</v>

1557
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Well what happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edmond?</v>

1559
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

1560
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Think about all those fights since he </v>
<v Speaker 3>left there.</v>

1561
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.480
<v Speaker 3>He was a bar man.</v>

1562
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I always said that he was the dark horse</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the division.</v>

1563
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.433
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something that this guy </v>

1564
01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:04.964
<v Speaker 3>puts it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can do some shit that you rarely see </v>

1565
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:08.504
<v Speaker 3>from a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went from alliance to Winkeljohn for </v>

1566
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:11.820
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1567
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1568
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:14.750
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went to a alliance,</v>

1569
01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:16.740
<v Speaker 3>then he went to Jackson's and was good </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1570
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then overeem,</v>

1571
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:19.483
<v Speaker 3>stayed there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he left and then he ended up going </v>

1572
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 3>to a Edmond with Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1573
01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.050
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1574
01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:29.640
<v Speaker 3>same thing I met on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what UFC it was ufc one,</v>

1575
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1576
01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought Ben Rothwell.</v>

1577
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 3>He was on the card fighting some scrub </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I looked at my coach and I was like,</v>

1578
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 3>do you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know about that guy?</v>

1579
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:39.830
<v Speaker 3>And it was leased fingers a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

1580
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 3>he's probably your next heavy weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>champ.</v>

1581
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.133
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the way moves on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to fight them like down </v>

1582
01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:46.370
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to fight them soon because I got so</v>

1583
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 3>much talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the next champ.</v>

1584
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:49.303
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1585
01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Then we saw him and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1586
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:52.274
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has footwork like dominick Cruz and </v>

1587
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:55.040
<v Speaker 3>he's a c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six seven.</v>

1588
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1589
01:09:55.911 --> 01:09:56.744
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand about him and Brian was pretty </v>

1590
01:09:58.011 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 3>adamant about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like after the last fight,</v>

1591
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.280
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's all this footwork worlds?</v>

1592
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:05.420
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember this guy having an incredible</v>

1593
01:10:05.421 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 3>footwork and movement when he was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson's camp and now he's just kind of</v>

1594
01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 3>lost all of it and he's become this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stagnant,</v>

1595
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 3>like great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has the same desire anymore.</v>

1596
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Like when he knocked out Gonzaga or Josh</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown.</v>

1597
01:10:19.101 --> 01:10:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Bingo.</v>

01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 6>I mean guys were brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel broken heart in a way.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Rhonda.</v>

1658
01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 6>She's so loyal but something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if she was so loyal,</v>

1659
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:14.880
<v Speaker 6>she wouldn't let the guy that got her </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the UFC guy who website,</v>

1660
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.850
<v Speaker 6>not the manager managers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Different managers come back.</v>

1661
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 6>She wouldn't have left 10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She knows what that deal is different.</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1663
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.753

<v Speaker 6>but there's two different versions of </v>

1664
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:28.344
<v Speaker 6>that story who I don't know who's right </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I feel the same way where for </v>

01:13:32.161 --> 01:13:33.520
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1667
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 6>The head punches great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but something wasn't there.</v>

1675
01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 6>drinks in them and they'd go to Hudson </v>
<v Speaker 6>county park to see if there was somebody</v>

1676
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:18.160

1678
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 6>I parked in the lot that was empty and </v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was walking over there,</v>

1679
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 6>some dude kept making eye contact with </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

1680
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.200
<v Speaker 6>He wanted me to suck Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 7>they see me from the podcast getting his</v>
<v Speaker 7>head.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he wanted to suck my dick.</v>

1689
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.630

<v Speaker 7>How'd you decide that it was dick?</v>

1690
01:14:58.810 --> 01:14:59.790
<v Speaker 7>How creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>

1691
01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:02.310
<v Speaker 7>Just his appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to say he look gay,</v>

1692
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.680
<v Speaker 7>but just as a pretty little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was a male.</v>

1693
01:15:04.681 --> 01:15:07.050
<v Speaker 7>Prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mouth is watering.</v>

1694
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.201
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1695
01:15:08.201 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so these guys,</v>

1696
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:12.700
<v Speaker 6>these guys will come down and they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 6>half drunk.</v>

1697
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:13.803
<v Speaker 6>Like in hindsight I think about it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they all these types of dudes that may </v>

1698
01:15:17.111 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 6>not just be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just have a family,</v>

1699
01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:24.331
<v Speaker 6>but they liked the scene in 1980 you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't easy to go.</v>

1700
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:25.593
<v Speaker 6>I'm coming out of the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot of guys and let me talk </v>

1701
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:31.410
<v Speaker 6>to you about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Been around.</v>

1702
01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:35.760
<v Speaker 6>The Guy told me the truth as a man </v>
<v Speaker 6>around the guy that when you get in your</v>

1703
01:15:35.761 --> 01:15:36.780
<v Speaker 6>car and go home,</v>

1704
01:15:36.781 --> 01:15:37.614
<v Speaker 6>you know one for sure.</v>

1705
01:15:39.991 --> 01:15:40.750
<v Speaker 6>second question.</v>

1706
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.583
<v Speaker 7>He's dying or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though he's got a hot girlfriend </v>

<v Speaker 7>fucking crossfit.</v>

1708
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:49.783

<v Speaker 7>Maybe he could talk them into switching </v>

1709
01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 7>governments if he's got a lot of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

1710
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.190
<v Speaker 7>When a kid is walking his dog,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

1723
01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:44.440
<v Speaker 6>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've had this,</v>

1724
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:46.730
<v Speaker 6>this millions that have married </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

1725
01:16:46.731 --> 01:16:50.990
<v Speaker 6>but every once in a while they put a </v>
<v Speaker 6>feather suit on and they'd go dance like</v>

1726
01:16:50.991 --> 01:16:53.390
<v Speaker 6>in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably more than 10.</v>

1727
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.260
<v Speaker 6>And that's what we used to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We used to go down and we was dumb kids.</v>

1728
01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:00.290
<v Speaker 6>We figured out we can rob these dudes </v>
<v Speaker 6>that were drunk.</v>

1729
01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.810
<v Speaker 6>They'd come down and get the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 6>sucked.</v>

1730
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.420
<v Speaker 6>So we got the captain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the police's son,</v>

1731
01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:06.254
<v Speaker 6>so we weren't going to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was better looking than you were </v>

1732
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 6>going to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We put him out there.</v>

1733
01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:11.414
<v Speaker 6>We could put like a a Guinea tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know those white beans with little </v>

1734
01:17:15.351 --> 01:17:16.184
<v Speaker 6>gold chain with a cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We put them out there and then we hide </v>

1735
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 6>in the trees and then he'd go and suck </v>
<v Speaker 6>his Dick and the guy would park and then</v>

1736
01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:30.500
<v Speaker 6>he'd walk them back and right before I </v>
<v Speaker 6>went through to get that one knee,</v>

1737
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:32.030
<v Speaker 6>I come up with that straight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1738
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:34.300

<v Speaker 6>You got to remember my crew was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>third crew out there was a crew from </v>

<v Speaker 6>64th street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They will not only robbing you,</v>

1748
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:01.303
<v Speaker 6>they were taking you to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had friends that were in high school </v>

<v Speaker 6>that actually would get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was setting you up here.</v>

1750
01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:07.454

<v Speaker 6>back in your car and go to your house </v>

1751
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 6>and rob you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were the light crew.</v>

1752
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.750
<v Speaker 6>We were just going down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're peppering you with a few shots.</v>

1753
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm running away with again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my point,</v>

1754
01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 6>but the store was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was one time where he got beat up.</v>

1755
01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.710
<v Speaker 6>I went down there by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You went to.</v>

1756
01:18:20.711 --> 01:18:22.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you went by myself.</v>

1757
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:25.340
<v Speaker 6>I had to mix minus the eight and a half </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I only won by eight,</v>

1758
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 6>so by the and I called my buddy that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>go dog,</v>

1759
01:18:29.931 --> 01:18:32.060
<v Speaker 6>we lost and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm with my girlfriend,</v>

1760
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:38.350
<v Speaker 6>but at the time I'm with you on it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm hanging out with my buddies back,</v>

1761
01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:47.690
<v Speaker 6>do nothing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He lit me up.</v>

1762
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.420
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could have been known as his uncle,</v>

1763
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 6>his uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He punched me with so many shots,</v>

1764
01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.950
<v Speaker 6>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he lit up,</v>

1765
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.600
<v Speaker 6>lit me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd had a bronco.</v>

1766
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 6>But here's the funny thing that in </v>
<v Speaker 6>hindsight now I know what Joe's saying.</v>

1767
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.940
<v Speaker 6>Levels of striking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never saw striking.</v>

1768
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.550
<v Speaker 6>It was nighttime,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I didn't even see his hands.</v>

1769
01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:11.790
<v Speaker 6>I just kept seeing it.</v>

1770
01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 6>Kept seeing the light.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you see lights at night,</v>

1771
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:20.960
<v Speaker 6>that's the motherfucker had some </v>
<v Speaker 6>training.</v>

1772
01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.133
<v Speaker 6>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a funny thing about striking </v>

1773
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:25.970
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this relates to what Amanda can do.</v>

1774
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 6>There's power and then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>

1775
01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:29.504
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like crazy God gifted </v>

1776
01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:31.523
<v Speaker 6>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people just have it and you see it </v>

1777
01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 6>with Linacre.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Linacre for sure.</v>

1778
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:36.470
<v Speaker 6>Has it rumbled for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has It?</v>

1779
01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 6>There's people that have this weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>

1780
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:39.403
<v Speaker 6>they have an ability to hit people and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you see people that normally can take a </v>

1781
01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:45.260
<v Speaker 6>shot and you see the look in their eye </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're in big trouble,</v>

1782
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 6>like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you get hit like that,</v>

1783
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:49.190
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't know where the fuck you are.</v>

1784
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In Jujitsu,</v>

1785
01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:53.403
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every black belt knows how to do a rear </v>

1786
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.324
<v Speaker 6>naked choke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but very few people can do a rear naked </v>

1787
01:19:58.491 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 6>choke like Marcella Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very few people.</v>

1788
01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.340
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because.</v>

1789
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.560
<v Speaker 6>Would you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you say it was natural,</v>

1790
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 6>like Linacre or</v>

1791
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.110
<v Speaker 5>was it because he spent a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfecting the back?</v>

1792
01:20:11.111 --> 01:20:13.050
<v Speaker 5>And I know for a fact that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he used to,</v>

1793
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:14.143
<v Speaker 5>he used to ride on people's backs with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the over under and not even trying to </v>

1794
01:20:16.531 --> 01:20:17.364
<v Speaker 5>tap him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would just spend a lot of time just </v>

1795
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 5>riding and perfecting the control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he just mastered the fight and then</v>

1796
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:22.884
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he realized how important that squeeze </v>

1797
01:20:24.481 --> 01:20:25.314
<v Speaker 5>was so that he would ride and squeeze </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he knew that it was all about the </v>

1798
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:28.824
<v Speaker 5>power of the squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's spent a lot of time with the </v>

1799
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:33.800
<v Speaker 5>rear naked choke and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot,</v>

1800
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.733
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's quite a few guys out there now </v>

1801
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are,</v>

1802
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a foul,</v>

1803
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:39.583
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his students and other guys that have </v>

1804
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:44.010
<v Speaker 5>developed back attacks is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1805
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.510
<v Speaker 5>is almost as good as marcel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but probably not as good now when you're</v>

1806
01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.140
<v Speaker 5>talking about power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1807
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.250
<v Speaker 5>the certain guys have the power whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're born with it or not.</v>

1808
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:58.490
<v Speaker 5>What if just what if the guys with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>power actually in their training working</v>

1809
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 5>harder and more consistently at </v>
<v Speaker 5>developing power.</v>

1810
01:21:03.751 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 5>Like what would you need?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you got that is a possibility,</v>

1811
01:21:08.551 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a physics issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also an anatomy.</v>

1812
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:13.650
<v Speaker 5>It's both though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be both,</v>

1813
01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:15.660
<v Speaker 5>but there's the big right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is like,</v>

1814
01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:16.494
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the Kurt Cody Garbrandt is not a </v>

1815
01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:18.774
<v Speaker 5>big hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not built like a George Foreman </v>

1816
01:21:20.671 --> 01:21:21.504
<v Speaker 5>type character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like George Foreman has freakish </v>

1817
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 5>physical attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got hands and they're like the size</v>

1818
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 5>of like canned hams there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking gigantic and he would just slump</v>

1819
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 5>just some guys with a jab and you'd see </v>
<v Speaker 5>them get stunned and hurt.</v>

1820
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.233
<v Speaker 5>Obviously trained like a motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously had very good check technique </v>

1821
01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 5>to obviously worked on all those things </v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

1822
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.260
<v Speaker 5>but you can't overcome the physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>attributes if a guy does all those other</v>

1823
01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:49.080
<v Speaker 5>things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where the freaks come in.</v>

1824
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.430
<v Speaker 5>That's where the people that just have </v>
<v Speaker 5>this ridiculous one shot power.</v>

1825
01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:55.370
<v Speaker 5>There's just an.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's technique.</v>

1826
01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 5>We can look at Congress on a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a wide shoulder guy,</v>

1827
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.690
<v Speaker 5>but he has that one hitter quitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1828
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.573
<v Speaker 5>no question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you think about your turning </v>

1829
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:06.290
<v Speaker 5>sidekick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1830
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.133
<v Speaker 5>Like your personal turning sidekick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's everybody knows now that it's </v>

1831
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 5>extremely powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a scary,</v>

1832
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.450
<v Speaker 5>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very few people.</v>

1833
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.660
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anybody throw turned </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>

1834
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:18.503
<v Speaker 5>Kick as hard as you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've worked with a lot of martial </v>

1835
01:22:20.191 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 5>artists in my time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still to this day.</v>

1836
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:24.850
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit Up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael White.</v>

1837
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's right up there too,</v>

1838
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 5>but he's like six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four to 40 anyways.</v>

1839
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have said many times that the,</v>

1840
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.103
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the secret behind your power was the </v>

1841
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.194
<v Speaker 5>reps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you knew that it was all about just </v>

1842
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:40.104
<v Speaker 5>hitting that heavy bag as many goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 5>times as possible every day to standing </v>

1843
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:45.234
<v Speaker 5>in front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you said that most people don't </v>

1844
01:22:47.161 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 5>develop that power because most people </v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't spend the time stealing a bag</v>

1845
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 5>and just working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was also built though.</v>

1846
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that to listen,</v>

1847
01:22:56.801 --> 01:22:57.634
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of guys that I trained </v>

1848
01:22:58.261 --> 01:23:03.261
<v Speaker 5>with and had good turning sidekicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always knew that I had a cheat.</v>

1849
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 5>I had a physical advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the</v>

1850
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.813
<v Speaker 3>size of my hands for someone my size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to realize I had hands </v>

1851
01:23:10.201 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 3>as big when I was fighting at 1:54.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous.</v>

1852
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:14.074
<v Speaker 3>They were just there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just certain physical attributes to the </v>

1853
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.433
<v Speaker 3>width of the shoulders is big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that has nothing to do with your </v>

1854
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:20.434
<v Speaker 3>turn inside dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does because in the hips to ask all </v>

1855
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:30.220
<v Speaker 3>the explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the fast fiber with powers.</v>

1856
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.060
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is fast twitch and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have fast,</v>

1857
01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 3>which you don't mean like Nick Diaz is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard puncher,</v>

1858
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Speaker 3>but he's never going to be a puncher </v>
<v Speaker 3>like weirdly,</v>

1859
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.733
<v Speaker 3>but no matter what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he trains with it will never be </v>

1860
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:45.560
<v Speaker 3>able to punch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In average,</v>

1861
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:46.713
<v Speaker 3>your average a MMA fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time do you think they spend </v>

1862
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 3>working on the power of their turning </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidekick?</v>

1863
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Very guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1864
01:23:55.451 --> 01:23:58.650
<v Speaker 3>No one really fills a space side kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

1865
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.660
<v Speaker 3>There's a few guys allotted a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time a week for 20 minutes I'm</v>

1866
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:05.254
<v Speaker 3>going to power how many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks on throwing a right hand or left </v>

1867
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:08.850
<v Speaker 3>hand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're dominant.</v>

1868
01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Lefthanded are southpaws does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only.</v>

1869
01:24:12.101 --> 01:24:14.690
<v Speaker 3>There's very few can do it in one punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>and knock guys out.</v>

1870
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:15.843
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters that specifically train </v>

1871
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 3>everyday just to develop specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>punching.</v>

1872
01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:21.064
<v Speaker 3>Like today I'm going to expense power </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches right in between camps in </v>

1873
01:24:24.301 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 3>between shows do that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys will just like go.</v>

1874
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Like George was famous for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would go down to [inaudible] and just</v>

1875
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.340
<v Speaker 3>just only trained Jujitsu for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>months on end,</v>

1876
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to really tighten everything up.</v>

1877
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 3>You went to Brazil a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to train in boxing.</v>

1878
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do a dachsund towards what's the</v>

1879
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:44.170
<v Speaker 3>best thing you can do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a professional fighter.</v>

1880
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:45.003
<v Speaker 3>You fight in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ranked 13th and you want to take </v>

1881
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:47.241
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1882
01:24:47.241 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your power of your hand.</v>

1883
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.970
<v Speaker 3>You want to be able to knock someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be.</v>

1884
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>You want to have that conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>

1885
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 3>What do I gotta do to get weight out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1886
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genetics.</v>

1887
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.473
<v Speaker 3>Genetics has a lot to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent of if you go see </v>

1888
01:25:04.331 --> 01:25:06.330
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could clean up the efficiency.</v>

1889
01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your shoulders.</v>

1890
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:09.953
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technique is a lot of stuff that goes </v>

1891
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 3>into that punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1892
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.183
<v Speaker 3>if a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a world champion wrestler came in and I </v>

1893
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:18.820
<v Speaker 3>came in and I was world champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler,</v>

1894
01:25:18.821 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 3>but my punches weren't that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in time.</v>

1895
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let me tell you something.</v>

1896
01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:25.474
<v Speaker 3>You talk to someone who's a real boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer and they will tell you that </v>

1897
01:25:28.091 --> 01:25:32.080
<v Speaker 3>there are guys that just come in and for</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason they might not have ever</v>

1898
01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:32.914
<v Speaker 3>boxed before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have them throw a jab and </v>

1899
01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:35.620
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1900
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:38.160
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1901
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.040
<v Speaker 3>For sure there's those pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it makes it better.</v>

1902
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:43.023
<v Speaker 3>You know the technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at a guy like Sergei </v>

1903
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Kovalev who's a vicious knockout </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists,</v>

1904
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.710
<v Speaker 3>vicious puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got both.</v>

1905
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 3>He's got the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful technique,</v>

1906
01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 3>but he also has that free gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God given strength.</v>

1907
01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys that oftentimes wind </v>
<v Speaker 3>up being champions to.</v>

1908
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:02.130
<v Speaker 3>To that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Andre Ward who just fought,</v>

1909
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't hide trains more than</v>

1910
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 5>surrogate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an Olympic medalist.</v>

1911
01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 5>Gold medalist has been training,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting since he was 10.</v>

1912
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.810
<v Speaker 5>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1913
01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.040
<v Speaker 5>He works on power punches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not a knockout or saying you're</v>

1914
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:13.874
<v Speaker 5>a head coach of a team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You until all your fighters to a era </v>

1915
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:18.770
<v Speaker 5>that bar north power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not.</v>

1916
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about working on your power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just work or not.</v>

1917
01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:25.280
<v Speaker 5>I always work on your power editor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can always improve everything,</v>

1918
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:26.263
<v Speaker 5>but you're never going to get it to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>rumble level like I'm never going to </v>

1919
01:26:28.601 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 5>tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1920
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 5>let's let's pick our shots here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's do more volume.</v>

1921
01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Can you do specifically 15 minutes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>week,</v>

1922
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:41.810
<v Speaker 5>30 minutes a week it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're focusing on developing power.</v>

1923
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.960
<v Speaker 5>You're not known for a rugby coach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter.</v>

1924
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.560
<v Speaker 5>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to do.</v>

1925
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:46.483
<v Speaker 5>What is it though specifically with </v>
<v Speaker 5>dumbbells like Muhammad and just throw </v>

1926
01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 5>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1927
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.510
<v Speaker 1>certainly do some strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning work that would help.</v>

1928
01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Just setting a back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting a bag would help a lot.</v>

1929
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Hitting power shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's all the above.</v>

1930
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.014
<v Speaker 1>Will help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like evander holyfield started working </v>

1931
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:05.384
<v Speaker 1>out with Mackie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll stone when he went up from </v>

1932
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:06.884
<v Speaker 1>cruiserweight to heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we did a lot of weight lifting and </v>

1933
01:27:08.421 --> 01:27:10.140
<v Speaker 1>his power came along with weight on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1934
01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Put a lot of weight on and maybe Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

1935
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 1>so explosive and maybe definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican supplements.</v>

1936
01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>

1937
01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and he could win the Olympia at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1938
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.453
<v Speaker 1>but the guys who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a good video of Joseph </v>

1939
01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.113
<v Speaker 1>Volta on is go to have a bazooka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Valtellina on his instagram page </v>

1940
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.843
<v Speaker 1>fault Illini who was glory champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to step back for it because because </v>

1941
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:33.940
<v Speaker 1>of concussions and I think he's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay retired,</v>

1942
01:27:33.941 --> 01:27:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't decided yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he went down on top.</v>

1943
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's one of the best kickbox in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1944
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's a video of him hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pads and just digging,</v>

1945
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:44.083
<v Speaker 1>digging into pads and talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of sometimes just going </v>

1946
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.230
<v Speaker 1>all out with power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just all our power shots on the paths.</v>

1947
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Like watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see this guy.</v>

1948
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a butt and when he's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's,</v>

1949
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:57.583
<v Speaker 1>when he's hitting these pads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good thing about it is hands never </v>

1950
01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:03.980
<v Speaker 1>dropped from his chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always good position,</v>

1951
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but to really dig in and work only </v>
<v Speaker 1>solely on your power,</v>

1952
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1953
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:15.140
<v Speaker 1>this is just something that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do occasionally and only,</v>

1954
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every athlete has to decide.</v>

1955
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what else you're working on,</v>

1956
01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:22.840
<v Speaker 1>five minutes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like this combination.</v>

1957
01:28:22.841 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 1>This is so simple.</v>

1958
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Combinations like right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hook,</v>

1959
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:28.050
<v Speaker 1>right kick to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1960
01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it better on a heavy bag then as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to these?</v>

1961
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just as good.</v>

1962
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.373
<v Speaker 1>That's just as good that style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not as good for straight </v>

1963
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:38.000
<v Speaker 1>kicks because you can't kick a person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body that way.</v>

1964
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Like if I put a body pat on a dude and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning back,</v>

1965
01:28:41.181 --> 01:28:42.740
<v Speaker 1>kick him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get really hurt.</v>

1966
01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll break your ribs even with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those big body shields on it.</v>

1967
01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 1>If you let someone spinning back kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the body,</v>

1968
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's going to break your ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some punches too.</v>

1969
01:28:50.151 --> 01:28:50.984
<v Speaker 1>If they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do a liver shot on the coach </v>

1970
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:53.650
<v Speaker 1>with a Ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll drop the.</v>

1971
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Drop them internal bleeding or hit soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up Mitch.</v>

1972
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude who lost,</v>

1973
01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>who was the first boxer that got choked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in</v>

1974
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 6>the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard that dude.</v>

1975
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:05.600
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he can fuck some meds.</v>

1976
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:10.610
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people snow piece.</v>

1977
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:12.580
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1978
01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.950
<v Speaker 6>you got to put extra.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He will.</v>

1979
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.813
<v Speaker 6>Fuck your shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was an artist when he was at his </v>

1980
01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:17.750
<v Speaker 6>best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was an artist.</v>

1981
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.980
<v Speaker 6>He jumped from that national team that </v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

1982
01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:22.080
<v Speaker 6>who's the best boxer most talented of </v>
<v Speaker 6>all time.</v>

1983
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 6>Every single person unanimously says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>James,</v>

1984
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:25.930
<v Speaker 6>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even floyd mayweather,</v>

1985
01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 6>the best we've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talent wise.</v>

1986
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.540
<v Speaker 6>James Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a bad motherfucker,</v>

1987
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 6>but he liked to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He loved him.</v>

1988
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:34.110
<v Speaker 6>Some fucking big banks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a problem.</v>

1989
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:36.720
<v Speaker 6>He got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went all the way up to heavyweight.</v>

1990
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know I'm James.</v>

1991
01:29:38.281 --> 01:29:41.160
<v Speaker 6>Tony started out his career at one 61 68</v>
<v Speaker 6>freak.</v>

1992
01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:43.710
<v Speaker 6>Super Freak to to to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To that point though,</v>

1993
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 6>and we can end on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll get rid of it.</v>

1994
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:48.000
<v Speaker 6>Look at baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Mark Mcguire.</v>

1995
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 6>He's never going to be a single base </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>

1996
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:50.783
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking guy who'd example full of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mexicans supplements when he's at his </v>

1997
01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 6>best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

1998
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:58.710
<v Speaker 6>If you get that guy on the couch and had</v>
<v Speaker 6>them hit a baseball,</v>

1999
01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much,</v>

2000
01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.380
<v Speaker 6>how much distance is the difference </v>
<v Speaker 6>between.</v>

2001
01:30:02.381 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 6>He might hit 30 home runs at a 70,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but still,</v>

2002
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:07.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean he was in his genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Big Forums,</v>

2003
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 6>powerful hips follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's never going to be the guy who would</v>

2004
01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 6>bunt the ball or lead on so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so same thing,</v>

2005
01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:16.830
<v Speaker 6>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack to the deals,</v>

2006
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.320
<v Speaker 6>but that might not necessarily translate</v>
<v Speaker 6>into punching power,</v>

2007
01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:21.780
<v Speaker 6>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they might just be really good</v>

2008
01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:22.810
<v Speaker 6>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2009
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 6>punching power is a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2010
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:27.160
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a real weird powers.</v>

2011
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 6>Just as quick as it hit hard because </v>
<v Speaker 6>that motherfucker throw hard.</v>

2012
01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 6>It again that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that movement from the hips,</v>

2013
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:36.670
<v Speaker 6>all that same movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They said that when you.</v>

2014
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 6>They had a documentary on him that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>needs three draft 30 for 30 hells yeah.</v>

2015
01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 6>They fucking slammed him while they had </v>
<v Speaker 6>a scam him up.</v>

2016
01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 6>Like they had pulled a starting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brenda had a.</v>

2017
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 6>had a drafted because he didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go to Baltimore.</v>

2018
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He don't want to go into the culture.</v>

2019
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:53.850
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This shit kinky shit,</v>

2020
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:57.030
<v Speaker 6>but bro,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this dude standing on the warning sign,</v>

2021
01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.390
<v Speaker 6>that's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could stay at the hunt,</v>

2022
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.233
<v Speaker 6>the warning track,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Elway take one step and put the </v>

2023
01:31:03.151 --> 01:31:08.151
<v Speaker 6>ball right there and your glove at home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but really that's deadly there.</v>

2024
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.520
<v Speaker 6>There's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have no idea.</v>

2025
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 6>How far is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to say three.</v>

2026
01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:14.461
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five,</v>

2027
01:31:14.461 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 6>305 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three hundred.</v>

2028
01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:18.240
<v Speaker 6>Five feet and he's easy throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it?</v>

2029
01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:20.890
<v Speaker 6>Does it going up in the air or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 6>straight line?</v>

2030
01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.033
<v Speaker 6>Just a bullet bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not to throw so fast for that </v>

2031
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:25.650
<v Speaker 6>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not to dry.</v>

2032
01:31:25.651 --> 01:31:29.850
<v Speaker 6>You have to watch some of the third </v>
<v Speaker 6>piece of fruit or like that.</v>

2033
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 6>It's very interesting how he didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to play with Baltimore,</v>

2034
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:35.970
<v Speaker 6>so somebody went to Stein brothers </v>
<v Speaker 6>office and they said,</v>

2035
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:37.103
<v Speaker 6>we'd like for you to draft John Elway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Steinbrenner goes and he opened up the </v>

2036
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:43.770
<v Speaker 6>schedule for the fucking the line up for</v>
<v Speaker 6>like three years later.</v>

2037
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:47.190
<v Speaker 6>He had always starting right field.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's why that's crazy.</v>

2038
01:31:47.191 --> 01:31:49.860
<v Speaker 6>His wife being able to throw from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>warning track into home plate,</v>

2039
01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:50.694
<v Speaker 6>as is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you took a baseball and you through </v>

2040
01:31:53.491 --> 01:31:58.491
<v Speaker 6>it and you shot a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would both drop at the same rate,</v>

2041
01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 6>so the bullet is only going to be in</v>

2042
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.220
<v Speaker 3>the air for a few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you could be 200 yards away,</v>

2043
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:04.054
<v Speaker 3>put your crosshairs on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone pulled the trigger and then </v>

2044
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:06.844
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they die immediately is because the </v>

2045
01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:09.424
<v Speaker 3>bullets traveling so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the drop has the same amount of </v>

2046
01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:12.214
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on how long it takes to </v>

2047
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 3>get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how far it's going to drop.</v>

2048
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're shooting someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>something from really far away,</v>

2049
01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of people that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into long range shooting.</v>

2050
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Like the goal in those ranges that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit these plates,</v>

2051
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>these steel plates that are like five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000</v>

2052
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 3>yards away and you hear bang clink like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2053
01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.030
<v Speaker 3>There's a delay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a noticeable delay,</v>

2054
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 3>and in that delay they have to calculate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drop.</v>

2055
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>So like if they're shooting at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>plate there radical where they aim,</v>

2056
01:32:41.441 --> 01:32:42.274
<v Speaker 3>it has to adjust for the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet is going to drop and the amount </v>

2057
01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 3>of time that it takes to get 800 yards </v>
<v Speaker 3>to aim higher.</v>

2058
01:32:48.090 --> 01:32:48.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's going to take a second or so or </v>

2059
01:32:50.501 --> 01:32:51.700
<v Speaker 3>half a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

2060
01:32:51.701 --> 01:32:54.760
<v Speaker 3>So they have to aim higher so that its </v>
<v Speaker 3>scope adjust for that.</v>

2061
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:56.163
<v Speaker 3>If you're throwing a baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine how much slower than it is than </v>

2062
01:32:59.351 --> 01:33:02.800
<v Speaker 3>a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to throw so fucking fast.</v>

2063
01:33:02.801 --> 01:33:05.260
<v Speaker 3>If you're throwing straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're just gonna,</v>

2064
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:08.500
<v Speaker 3>throw straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silly and go get into home plate.</v>

2065
01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:10.930
<v Speaker 3>That mother fucker must be throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>

2066
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.593
<v Speaker 3>It must be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know his receivers in Denver the </v>

2067
01:33:14.311 --> 01:33:15.144
<v Speaker 3>first few years I couldn't catch them of</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch the ball they played catch with </v>

2068
01:33:17.381 --> 01:33:18.214
<v Speaker 3>their pads and will be so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude leave imprints on the nuclear </v>

2069
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 3>plants on the chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People crazy.</v>

2070
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:24.423
<v Speaker 3>And that's a known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a known skill that some people </v>

2071
01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:29.290
<v Speaker 3>just never developed the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw a fastball.</v>

2072
01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:30.363
<v Speaker 3>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like punching paint discussed it </v>

2073
01:33:31.601 --> 01:33:32.370
<v Speaker 3>last time.</v>

2074
01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:33.203
<v Speaker 3>The dynamics of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you who I think would </v>

2075
01:33:35.851 --> 01:33:39.700
<v Speaker 3>translate from if he threw a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who was explosive with as fuck and</v>

2076
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 3>could throw and do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bo Jackson.</v>

2077
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bo Jackson Bunch.</v>

2078
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Have you taught both?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson had a punch,</v>

2079
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another example.</v>

2080
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:48.094
<v Speaker 3>Herschel Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herschel Walker could punch like a </v>

2081
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:51.790
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker and he was a karate black </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>

2082
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.653
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fought a bunch of MMA fights deep </v>

2083
01:33:54.071 --> 01:33:59.071
<v Speaker 3>into his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember Jack didn't like 48.</v>

2084
01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Bridgette giant six pack.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's in his fifties now.</v>

2089
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Talking about having one more fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>before he stopped.</v>

2090

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's over and maybe she was a pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler or something.</v>

2149
01:36:59.410 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Think she was a protester.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably gave her a big ass pay day</v>

2150
01:37:02.361 --> 01:37:03.830
<v Speaker 3>to lose a few years of her life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>

2156
01:37:18.861 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 3>The worst person ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most brutal mismatch ever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean she could have easily not even </v>

01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 3>hurt the old lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will pay to watch anything on new</v>

2162

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

2216
01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to tantric ritual where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that they said that.</v>

2217
01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.293
<v Speaker 1>So that one's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a few of those did they did </v>

2218
01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>with a stage stuff where they pretend </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2219
01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:24.510
<v Speaker 1>pulling out the guts that was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting fake and cheesy.</v>

2220
01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.730
<v Speaker 1>But at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey was really screaming,</v>

2221
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:27.564
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were hitting him in the fucking </v>

2222
01:40:28.081 --> 01:40:29.670
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

2223
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:32.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing to the way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2224
01:40:32.581 --> 01:40:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Before they knew that eating primate </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains is like super bad for you.</v>

2225
01:40:36.121 --> 01:40:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2226
01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:38.723
<v Speaker 1>He primates have prions in their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get mad cow disease </v>

2227
01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.680
<v Speaker 1>like mad cow disease or Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob how?</v>

2228
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:45.683
<v Speaker 1>How are you saying that disease comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from eating the same tissue as the </v>

2229
01:40:49.291 --> 01:40:52.440
<v Speaker 1>species that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why cows get it.</v>

2230
01:40:52.441 --> 01:40:57.441
<v Speaker 1>Cows get from eating brain tissue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other cows like you feed cows.</v>

2231
01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.653
<v Speaker 1>The like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the horrible things about </v>

2232
01:40:59.711 --> 01:41:00.544
<v Speaker 1>industrialized farming is they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually take whatever the fuck is left </v>

2233
01:41:03.021 --> 01:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>to the cow they're not using and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>grind it up and feed it to fucking cows.</v>

2234
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Cows that are straight vegetarian that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are only supposed to be in grass.</v>

2235
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:13.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not even supposed to eat corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we eat corn,</v>

2236
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:16.000
<v Speaker 1>it fucks them up and they're feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>them cow brains.</v>

2237
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.073
<v Speaker 1>They're feed them their own bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hard and that's what gets in and </v>

2238
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:23.160
<v Speaker 1>that's how they got mad cow disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreads.</v>

2239
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.760
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

2240
01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You can raise your good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother used to slice them thin rather</v>

2241
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 1>than with Italian progresso and deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>frying God damn fucking lemon.</v>

2242
01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:37.430
<v Speaker 1>My uncle vinny used to cook them on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grills.</v>

2243
01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Any hold up brands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brands,</v>

2244
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:46.400
<v Speaker 1>brands have a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats.</v>

2245
01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2246
01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:55.930
<v Speaker 1>That's such a small scoop of cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cat guy.</v>

2247
01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:56.873
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2248
01:41:58.610 --> 01:42:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom used to slice those cat cow.</v>

2249
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.130
<v Speaker 1>We used limit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I give them to you and go,</v>

2250
01:42:08.131 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and eat that chicken cutlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go joey,</v>

2251
01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:13.310
<v Speaker 1>this shouldn't call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a fuck of that.</v>

2252
01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Chicken cutlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calves,</v>

2253
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.540
<v Speaker 1>brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll probably throw a cow brains.</v>

2254
01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good.</v>

2255
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 1>We won't leave this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't feed it to another cow.</v>

2256
01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's a thing called prions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are what the problem is.</v>

2257
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And these prions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's really crazy.</v>

2258
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like nature has a foolproof </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2259
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.133
<v Speaker 1>There's Catholic pranks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature has a foolproof way of making </v>

2260
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:40.450
<v Speaker 1>sure it fucks you up with these prions </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's.</v>

2261
01:42:40.451 --> 01:42:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Prions can exist at a thousand plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees for a long time,</v>

2262
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.610
<v Speaker 1>so you can't cook them out like they.</v>

2263
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.990
<v Speaker 1>They exist at a temperature way above </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you've ever been to expose your</v>

2264
01:42:52.991 --> 01:42:53.824
<v Speaker 1>food too and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think find out how long prions can </v>

2265
01:42:57.311 --> 01:43:02.311
<v Speaker 1>exist at over a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something stunning like hours,</v>

2266
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 1>hours at a thousand degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not going to kill them,</v>

2267
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:06.663
<v Speaker 1>so if you've got them in your food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating and where they found </v>

2268
01:43:09.431 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 1>this also not just in mad cow disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in New Guinea,</v>

2269
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 1>in cannibals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they find cannibals,</v>

2270
01:43:15.371 --> 01:43:16.204
<v Speaker 1>they exhibit the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological issues where their whole </v>

2271
01:43:18.251 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 1>body starts shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with Jacobs,</v>

2272
01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Clark's felds is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot like Parkinson's,</v>

2273
01:43:23.181 --> 01:43:25.410
<v Speaker 1>like they start fucking shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

2274
01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.273
<v Speaker 1>It's a neurological disease that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>prions from eating brain matter from </v>

2275
01:43:30.191 --> 01:43:31.024
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually gets into your system and </v>

2276
01:43:33.221 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 1>just fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

2277
01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You can eat meat though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat human meat.</v>

2278
01:43:37.361 --> 01:43:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do any.</v>

2279
01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:39.403
<v Speaker 1>It's human brains is the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just who the fuck is he in human </v>

2281
01:43:43.331 --> 01:43:44.500
<v Speaker 1>brains?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>

2282
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:45.334
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was one of the best </v>

2283
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:47.583
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best pieces of evidence that human </v>

2284
01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:53.050
<v Speaker 1>beings homosapiens preyed on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertones.</v>

2285
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It was finding neanderthal brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our skulls with their brain scooped out.</v>

2286
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.753
<v Speaker 1>They had scratch marks on the inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are scooping out the </v>

2287
01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had spoons,</v>

2288
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.070
<v Speaker 1>they had rocks that whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could use to scoop stuff up,</v>

2289
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're scraping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're getting a brain,</v>

2290
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:10.544
<v Speaker 1>there's that connective tissues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit that all goes wrong when you </v>

2291
01:44:13.341 --> 01:44:15.940
<v Speaker 1>get knocked out too many times and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connective tissues,</v>

2292
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:16.783
<v Speaker 1>this fibrous matrix that holds the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in place and they're scraping that shit </v>

2293
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:24.140
<v Speaker 1>away with a rock as gel that covers your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid fluid.</v>

2294
01:44:24.141 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 1>But there's also like tissue.</v>

2295
01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.390
<v Speaker 1>There's scratches and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2296
01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.400
<v Speaker 1>knows it's tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like deep bone scratches,</v>

2297
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:34.580
<v Speaker 1>gnarly as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out.</v>

2298
01:44:34.610 --> 01:44:38.600
<v Speaker 1>They know the difference between what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the characteristics of,</v>

2299
01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:40.340
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of predatory stuff like,</v>

2300
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:41.323
<v Speaker 1>like an animal that's like gnawing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and real obvious slices that came </v>

2301
01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:46.460
<v Speaker 1>from like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tool.</v>

2302
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Like when when human beings made lowe's </v>
<v Speaker 1>flint tools and shit like that.</v>

2303
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.253
<v Speaker 1>So they've done enough of those tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>were these archeologists can examine </v>

2304
01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.393
<v Speaker 1>these flint marks on bones and with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high degree of certainty tell </v>

2305
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 1>whether or not someone's using a flint </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool on bone,</v>

2306
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:04.640
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2307
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:07.010
<v Speaker 1>what's one of the more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about Egypt.</v>

2308
01:45:07.011 --> 01:45:07.844
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because there's some artifacts in </v>

2309
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:10.994
<v Speaker 1>Egypt that are so perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I had John Anthony West on the </v>

2310
01:45:13.911 --> 01:45:16.150
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I had some conversations about.</v>

2311
01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how the fuck they carve these</v>

2312
01:45:19.611 --> 01:45:20.444
<v Speaker 1>things out.</v>

2313
01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.550
<v Speaker 1>There's these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some vases,</v>

2314
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:23.480
<v Speaker 1>vase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vase,</v>

2315
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:27.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they made out of stone that exhibit</v>

2316
01:45:27.651 --> 01:45:27.991
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2317
01:45:27.991 --> 01:45:29.690
<v Speaker 1>looks like someone cut them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diamond,</v>

2318
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:32.360
<v Speaker 1>like some diamond headed drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't.</v>

2319
01:45:32.361 --> 01:45:33.194
<v Speaker 1>They literally don't know how they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it's missing all the </v>

2320
01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:36.493
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of a that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally get from someone making </v>

2321
01:45:39.531 --> 01:45:40.331
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

2322
01:45:40.331 --> 01:45:41.164
<v Speaker 1>the hole at the front is too small and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes inside and it's all smooth </v>

2323
01:45:44.661 --> 01:45:46.220
<v Speaker 1>insides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck did they did this?</v>

2324
01:45:46.221 --> 01:45:47.054
<v Speaker 1>They did it all out of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They carved out a one piece of stone so </v>

2325
01:45:50.031 --> 01:45:53.030
<v Speaker 1>they can see stuff like they found some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things,</v>

2326
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:55.750
<v Speaker 1>different holes in things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure like some,</v>

2327
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:59.100
<v Speaker 1>they use some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not a diamond drill,</v>

2328
01:45:59.101 --> 01:46:01.340
<v Speaker 1>like some kind of a drill with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly hard tip,</v>

2329
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.013
<v Speaker 1>but so they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that people were eating </v>

2330
01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.930
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucked up.</v>

2331
01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up,</v>

2332
01:46:10.101 --> 01:46:12.320
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2333
01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:13.154
<v Speaker 1>We know the Donner party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking hate each other and they </v>

2334
01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.434
<v Speaker 1>knew each other and they ate each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that lily alive plane that went </v>

2335
01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:20.300
<v Speaker 1>down to Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2336
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get hungry.</v>

2337
01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:24.320
<v Speaker 1>You do whatever the fuck you gotta do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

2338
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 1>If we go down and play there when be </v>
<v Speaker 1>started looking at me and shit like,</v>

2339
01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:33.470
<v Speaker 1>oh Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got some good ribs.</v>

2340
01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.630
<v Speaker 1>How long it takes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

2341
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.113
<v Speaker 1>How many days of no food does it take </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start looking at other dudes </v>

2342
01:46:44.421 --> 01:46:45.254
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>

2343
01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his shoulder starts looking good.</v>

2344
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also like if</v>

2345
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 3>you were with your friend and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trapped somewhere,</v>

2346
01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.870
<v Speaker 3>you would have to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2347
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>if I eat this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to live with that for the rest of</v>

2348
01:46:58.861 --> 01:47:01.080
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even if you guys drew straws,</v>

2349
01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:02.071
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2350
01:47:02.071 --> 01:47:03.870
<v Speaker 3>one of us going to live when I was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

2351
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.390
<v Speaker 3>If I come up short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm jumping off this fucking cliff.</v>

2352
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.313
<v Speaker 3>You climbed down the bottom and eat me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you make an agreement with someone </v>

2353
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:11.784
<v Speaker 3>who's so gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually fall through that Matt </v>

2354
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Brown type character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2355
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:18.864
<v Speaker 3>So if you did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you probably were going to die </v>

2356
01:47:21.361 --> 01:47:23.000
<v Speaker 3>anyway eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2357
01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:23.843
<v Speaker 3>and then on your way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be so ridden with guilt and even </v>

2358
01:47:27.181 --> 01:47:29.730
<v Speaker 3>if you made it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you made it home,</v>

2359
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.340
<v Speaker 3>you'd be fucked for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2360
01:47:32.341 --> 01:47:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of a life do you even </v>
<v Speaker 3>have now that you ate your buddy?</v>

2361
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a good time to know Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2362
01:47:37.111 --> 01:47:37.944
<v Speaker 3>In a plane crash and Sir you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to survive up in the mountains that </v>

2363
01:47:40.611 --> 01:47:43.070
<v Speaker 3>there's 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be for a while.</v>

2364
01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:43.943
<v Speaker 3>You just put a little children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fucking Jujitsu game eating after 21 </v>

2365
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 3>days without foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you start getting fucked up,</v>

2366
01:47:50.491 --> 01:47:52.620
<v Speaker 3>that's that naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afraid yet three days with water.</v>

2367
01:47:52.621 --> 01:47:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Twenty one without food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2368
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2369
01:47:54.451 --> 01:47:55.284
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked up pretty much right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your body goes into a state of </v>

2370
01:47:57.511 --> 01:47:59.880
<v Speaker 3>ketosis that he eats off as much fat as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have.</v>

2371
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.550
<v Speaker 3>The more fat you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better you know we don't think about</v>

2372
01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are carbohydrate rich diets?</v>

2373
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Leave this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you showing me?</v>

2374
01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Survivals last resort.</v>

2375
01:48:08.141 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 3>In the case of one group adrift in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifeboat,</v>

2376
01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:11.184
<v Speaker 3>hundred 16 passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>116 days passed without food before the </v>

2377
01:48:14.311 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 3>party turned to eating human flesh.</v>

2378
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:16.703
<v Speaker 3>In most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything even remotely resembling food </v>

2379
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:22.920
<v Speaker 3>was first eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dogs candles,</v>

2380
01:48:22.921 --> 01:48:23.754
<v Speaker 3>leather shoes and blankets are all </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed first before cannibalism </v>

2381
01:48:26.611 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 3>becomes the only recourse for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leather shoes.</v>

2382
01:48:30.211 --> 01:48:32.760
<v Speaker 3>The shoes and blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blankets,</v>

2383
01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.190
<v Speaker 3>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

2384
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:38.970
<v Speaker 3>That's dark you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you do is you rear naked,</v>

2385
01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 3>choke one dude and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2386
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:41.850
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking had a heart attack,</v>

2387
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 3>and then you always have another body </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're in charge of that.</v>

2388
01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking choked them out.</v>

2389
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:50.460
<v Speaker 3>If you choke him out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body goes into fucking.</v>

2390
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:51.703
<v Speaker 3>The meat's going to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying is that when </v>

2391
01:48:54.151 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 3>you shoot it the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to let them die of natural</v>

2392
01:48:57.481 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 3>causes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the meat tender,</v>

2393
01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 3>then you cut a little slice off a leg.</v>

2394
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.480
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were going to kill this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and on.</v>

2395
01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm killing them with kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kindness to this tab,</v>

2396
01:49:11.911 --> 01:49:14.160
<v Speaker 3>and then the meat is gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me.</v>

2397
01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 3>My buddy called me some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go see you in Colorado.</v>

2398
01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:22.750
<v Speaker 3>He invented a bullet that hits the duck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has marinated in it.</v>

2399
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Why have you heard about or I sweat a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

2400
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:31.920
<v Speaker 3>It has a marinades Teriyaki or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>for duck that when you shoot the gun,</v>

2401
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.070
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you hit it goes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>

2402
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:39.690
<v Speaker 3>so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something crazy.</v>

2403
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that would work but yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I go,</v>

2404
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:42.970
<v Speaker 3>he's done Denver this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go see him.</v>

2405
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:47.060
<v Speaker 3>He goes bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about marijuana is rotten.</v>

2406
01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:47.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point to know what the </v>

2407
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:49.234
<v Speaker 3>fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was marinated the capital peppers </v>

2408
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:53.704
<v Speaker 3>here and we're in a fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to keep the bullets in the </v>

2409
01:49:55.871 --> 01:49:56.704
<v Speaker 3>freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2410
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a bad business plan though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julia.</v>

2411
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:01.413
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a dude is high on meth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and comes up with a wacky idea that's </v>

2412
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.990
<v Speaker 3>not going to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on Rogan.</v>

2413
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:06.220
<v Speaker 3>I get these teriyaki bullets.</v>

2414
01:50:08.670 --> 01:50:12.820
<v Speaker 3>You have to do shit cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot him with a Teriyaki bullet,</v>

2415
01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but marinade is like if you marinate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>steak,</v>

2416
01:50:17.621 --> 01:50:18.454
<v Speaker 3>you need to like a pan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fill it up with marijuana and you </v>

2417
01:50:20.771 --> 01:50:24.490
<v Speaker 3>lay it in there and the idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly works its way into the muscle.</v>

2418
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Soaks in over like a day or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doc,</v>

2419
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:31.750
<v Speaker 3>he's up in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time you get to him,</v>

2420
01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 3>two days later,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you see if he could find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>online?</v>

2427
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Because I've only seen the finish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the way.</v>

2428
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:50.644
<v Speaker 3>Trap the leg and caught him when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to drop stomps on them and stuff </v>

2429
01:50:54.401 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 3>and he's off his back.</v>

2430
01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:58.420
<v Speaker 3>The whole rising card was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a great card.</v>

2431
01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.430
<v Speaker 3>He pulled guard three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not freak people frown upon it?</v>

2432
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.293
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's another one like we're talking </v>

<v Speaker 3>I was like 55 or seven.</v>

2439
01:51:26.690 --> 01:51:29.130
<v Speaker 3>That's Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he might've weighed 45 cards.</v>

<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

2531
01:55:03.351 --> 01:55:06.740
<v Speaker 3>they're just not going to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of technique that he has,</v>

2532
01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.470

2539
01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.333

<v Speaker 3>but the cool thing about pulling guard </v>

2540
01:55:21.441 --> 01:55:24.320
<v Speaker 3>and having a guard good enough to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it a good idea.</v>

2541

<v Speaker 3>If yOu could do it at any time to </v>

2558
01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.490

2574
01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll go through the.</v>

2575
01:56:58.050 --> 01:57:00.080
<v Speaker 3>He'd have to go through the small fight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>if he decided to go through the us route</v>

2580
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:08.783
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't get into the ufc until he </v>

2581
01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:11.590
<v Speaker 3>had like four or five five to thrive.</v>

01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.173
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she pissed hot for is also an anti </v>

2618
01:58:46.091 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 1>androgen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dyo has a dht inhibitor.</v>

2619
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I used to rub that shit in my head to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent hair loss.</v>

2620
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:54.843
<v Speaker 1>They might give it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also used by people that take </v>

2621
01:58:57.191 --> 01:59:01.150
<v Speaker 1>steroids to diminish the effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2622
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:04.330
<v Speaker 1>of like when females take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish the effect.</v>

2623
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a masking agent.</v>

2624
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people take that stuff as a mask.</v>

2625
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:12.550
<v Speaker 1>She's 31.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a diarrhetic.</v>

2626
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very weird drug called </v>
<v Speaker 1>spironolactone dean lactone,</v>

2627
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but it has many different uses if she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she gets three years,</v>

2628
01:59:21.641 --> 01:59:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounded good argument.</v>

2629
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:26.403
<v Speaker 1>All the arguments that she gave her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good arguments that she took </v>

2630
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:33.460
<v Speaker 1>something out of competition that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was told bY her doctor that will be okay</v>

2631
01:59:33.461 --> 01:59:35.590
<v Speaker 1>when it's clearly on the usada banned </v>
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>

2632
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's certain things you</v>

2633
01:59:39.191 --> 01:59:40.720
<v Speaker 1>could take out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of context,</v>

2634
01:59:40.721 --> 01:59:41.554
<v Speaker 1>like the big ones pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if they catch you tomorrow and </v>

2635
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to fight in six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're smoking weed like crazy,</v>

2636
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and they test you and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2637
01:59:48.611 --> 01:59:49.420
<v Speaker 1>we got to test you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go look,</v>

2638
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I just want to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but smoke a lot of weed.</v>

2639
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:51.970
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2640
01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:52.803
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what jon jones didn't get in </v>

2641
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:59.470
<v Speaker 1>troUble when he pissed hot for cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks out of the fight with daniel</v>

2642
01:59:59.471 --> 02:00:00.304
<v Speaker 1>cormier because that's not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and it's not a performance </v>

2643
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Just partying.</v>

2644
02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:04.984
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what this is though is a performance </v>

2645
02:00:06.851 --> 02:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a performance enhancing drug,</v>

2646
02:00:09.461 --> 02:00:14.461
<v Speaker 1>but problematic in that it inhibits its </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing in,</v>

2647
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>that works as a diuretic and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to use diuretics,</v>

2648
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also inhibits your,</v>

2649
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2650
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>their ability to detect steroids in you.</v>

2651
02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:24.543
<v Speaker 1>She's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wAs in the truck you saw that's </v>

2652
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>going to eat her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if she gets three years,</v>

2653
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

2654
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>how old is she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in her mid thirties.</v>

2655
02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Third day they started to get tested her</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she passed on three world title </v>

2656
02:00:37.151 --> 02:00:37.984
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had three world title fights lined </v>

2657
02:00:40.661 --> 02:00:41.494
<v Speaker 1>up for her at 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way class that she asked </v>

2658
02:00:43.481 --> 02:00:44.314
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she couldn't make it in eight </v>

2659
02:00:45.941 --> 02:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>weeks and so then they gave her more </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and they gave her.</v>

2660
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.193
<v Speaker 1>They gave her a third test and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sums up and whether or not they were </v>

2661
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>going to test her anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2662
02:00:54.911 --> 02:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>But that's when they tested her and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when she pissed hot.</v>

2663
02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.353
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she did not reveal before that that </v>

2664
02:01:01.110 --> 02:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>she was taking that and then she does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is a.</v>

2665
02:01:04.650 --> 02:01:05.970
<v Speaker 3>He's in trouble man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2666
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen escaping all babies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skeptical baby now.</v>

2667
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:17.310
<v Speaker 3>So basically that it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like bitch.</v>

2668
02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Like that skeptical snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So skeptical with sideburns.</v>

2669
02:01:25.190 --> 02:01:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Super scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the skeptical house?</v>

2670
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:30.660
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers so skeptical.</v>

2671
02:01:30.661 --> 02:01:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical,</v>

2672
02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.900
<v Speaker 3>cadillac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ridiculous.</v>

2673
02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.793
<v Speaker 3>Cadillac house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is so is that a real </v>

2674
02:01:40.611 --> 02:01:41.520
<v Speaker 3>house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2675
02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:45.360
<v Speaker 3>those are windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the window is that window.</v>

2676
02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they did that on purpose </v>
<v Speaker 3>held what's wrong with people?</v>

2677
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It almost seems like that was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>

2678
02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:54.870
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with sideboard,</v>

2679
02:01:54.871 --> 02:01:55.730
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets three years.</v>

2680
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:56.564
<v Speaker 3>She's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find the answer to when ronda lost </v>

2681
02:01:58.241 --> 02:02:00.140
<v Speaker 3>again and she's throwing shade at ronda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2682
02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:01.270
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2683
02:02:01.570 --> 02:02:05.840
<v Speaker 3>You just got busted for steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steroids.</v>

2684
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:08.720
<v Speaker 3>She got busted for a dihydro </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

2685
02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:08.911
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2686
02:02:08.911 --> 02:02:09.920
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a precursor.</v>

2687
02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a dihydrotestosterone inhibitor.</v>

2688
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:15.260
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inhibitor and to me,</v>

2689
02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:16.910
<v Speaker 3>my brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in trouble.</v>

2690
02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:19.400
<v Speaker 3>You're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She certainly could be in trouble.</v>

2691
02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:24.320
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing if she got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said was she's got a bunch of issues</v>

2692
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 3>because she really did record body </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting down to 1:40,</v>

2693
02:02:27.081 --> 02:02:31.460
<v Speaker 3>which happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure that that seems fine when</v>

2694
02:02:31.461 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 3>you wreck your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think she's saying that she takes</v>

2695
02:02:34.191 --> 02:02:35.024
<v Speaker 3>him too much water down or bodies like </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to hold onto water and that they </v>

2696
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 3>gave her a drug to diminish the amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of water.</v>

2697
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I talked to a couple of doctors about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2698
02:02:44.421 --> 02:02:49.421
<v Speaker 3>I asked them questions and they all gave</v>
<v Speaker 3>me that snake face in there.</v>

2699
02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 3>You know her background too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2700
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:53.743
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he don't fuck with anything that's </v>

2701
02:02:55.251 --> 02:02:56.084
<v Speaker 3>illegal and you definitely don't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>with anything that people use because </v>

2702
02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:00.380
<v Speaker 3>they're women that take steroids.</v>

2703
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's just a coincidence that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to be.</v>

2704
02:03:03.231 --> 02:03:06.310
<v Speaker 3>You should look at every fucking label.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extremely careful.</v>

2705
02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that the worst of all time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2706
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.570
<v Speaker 3>that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean cut?</v>

2707
02:03:11.571 --> 02:03:12.500
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>

2711
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:26.890
<v Speaker 3>She fucking dead lifts 305 pounds a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks after passing on fights.</v>

2712
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:30.540
<v Speaker 3>She passes on the fight and then puts up</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagrams of her dead,</v>

2713
02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:33.930
<v Speaker 3>lifting massive weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in,</v>

2714
02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:34.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was whoever the fuck handles her </v>

2715
02:03:37.041 --> 02:03:39.200
<v Speaker 3>twitter account because I wrote that up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2717
02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:42.530
<v Speaker 3>we're having a discussion about it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

2718
02:03:42.650 --> 02:03:43.483
<v Speaker 3>Very good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were having a little back and forth </v>

2719
02:03:44.991 --> 02:03:46.870
<v Speaker 3>on twitter about it.</v>

02:03:46.871 --> 02:03:47.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2721
02:03:47.481 --> 02:03:49.190
<v Speaker 3>isn't it weird that she's not fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the title?</v>

2722
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's weird is that they pack that,</v>

2723
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:56.030
<v Speaker 3>she passed on title fight and then post </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram photos of her dead lifting.</v>

2724
02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.013
<v Speaker 3>And then she responded that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what football players do when </v>

2725
02:03:59.151 --> 02:04:00.410
<v Speaker 3>they're not in camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

2726
02:04:00.411 --> 02:04:01.460
<v Speaker 3>The other day,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2728
02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.920
<v Speaker 3>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not writing.</v>

2729

2767
02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:35.994

<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're doing all the time.</v>

2769
02:05:42.211 --> 02:05:45.450

2779
02:06:09.481 --> 02:06:10.314
<v Speaker 3>but it's her punches that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferocious and she doesn't hit hard and </v>

2780
02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:13.110
<v Speaker 3>cyborg.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're working with these other </v>

2847
02:08:41.141 --> 02:08:42.130
<v Speaker 3>celebrities.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your will.</v>

2849
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Now when you lose that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone stops ringing,</v>

2850
02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:48.360
<v Speaker 3>the tech stop coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone asks you to dinner.</v>

2851
02:08:48.361 --> 02:08:49.194
<v Speaker 3>That stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find out who's in your </v>

2852
02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:50.674

2853
02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.630
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you,</v>

2854
02:08:52.630 --> 02:08:54.490
<v Speaker 3>what did you do the last two years?</v>

2855
02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Because I heard they cut her down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other one disappeared.</v>

2856
02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what kind of deal she has,</v>

2857
02:09:00.611 --> 02:09:01.444
<v Speaker 3>but things definitely dried up </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantially after the holly knockout </v>

2858
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:05.320
<v Speaker 3>because she's not the same person </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2859
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:06.333
<v Speaker 3>The thing about all those deals is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a winner in hollywood and they </v>

2860
02:09:09.851 --> 02:09:13.600
<v Speaker 3>start throwing all these movies at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're some athletes coming over,</v>

2861
02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:16.750
<v Speaker 3>it's all predicated on you being that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that they're selling.</v>

2862
02:09:16.751 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they selling?</v>

2863
02:09:17.861 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 3>They're selling this undefeated women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass kicker.</v>

2864
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.790
<v Speaker 3>The likes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've never seen before,</v>

2865
02:09:21.791 --> 02:09:23.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throwing people in their head,</v>

2866
02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:25.000
<v Speaker 3>get them in an arm bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're selling.</v>

2867
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not you anymore.</v>

2868
02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Now you Just got smashed by holly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then smashed again by amanda.</v>

2869
02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:35.660
<v Speaker 3>They can't sell your acting abilities to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>

2870
02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:38.700
<v Speaker 3>She'd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd do roadhouse.</v>

2871
02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Did she redo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roadhouse?</v>

2872
02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed him.</v>

2873
02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know to,</v>

2874
02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:47.890
<v Speaker 3>to his point where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost a good thing for it.</v>

2875
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:48.850
<v Speaker 3>It reallY is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2876
02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:51.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not a sad story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't find it as a sad story.</v>

2877
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2878
02:09:52.631 --> 02:09:54.240
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was an angel.</v>

2879
02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.650
<v Speaker 3>It's disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2880
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Story came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves all that different.</v>

2881
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Do we feel safer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiger woods,</v>

2882
02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:03.100
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that foundation rocks,</v>

2883
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:05.170
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is different with </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiger's swing?</v>

2884
02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:06.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold the different tiger woods.</v>

2885
02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:09.540
<v Speaker 3>He can get the fuck beat out of them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>48 seconds.</v>

2886
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:10.433
<v Speaker 3>I know and that's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is the mentality </v>

2887
02:10:12.701 --> 02:10:15.830
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When tiger was unstoppable and he.</v>

2888
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had that.</v>

2889
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:18.183
<v Speaker 3>He had the scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he also had some significant </v>

2890
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:21.790
<v Speaker 3>back injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2891
02:10:21.791 --> 02:10:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Or what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2892
02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:24.250
<v Speaker 3>For better example to your fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

2893
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:25.720
<v Speaker 3>like thaisa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2894
02:10:25.721 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 3>That's also wear and tear too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2895
02:10:27.630 --> 02:10:29.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say that.</v>

2896
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.863
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you why I can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why is because the </v>

2897
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 3>driver</v>

2898
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.053
<v Speaker 1>that I had this weekend in vegas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>took me to the airport was mike tyson's </v>

2899
02:10:38.421 --> 02:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>driver for 17 years and I had a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2900
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:42.703
<v Speaker 1>Cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember his fucking </v>

2901
02:10:43.941 --> 02:10:44.774
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I only met him for the brief brief </v>

2902
02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:46.934
<v Speaker 1>ride to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was telling me how fucked up </v>

2903
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>tyson was after the lennox lewis fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2904
02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:51.674
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lennox lewis hit mike and mike was </v>

2905
02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>fucked up for a long time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You don't think that you watch a guy</v>

2906
02:10:56.871 --> 02:10:59.210
<v Speaker 1>get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch guy get stopped and you know,</v>

2907
02:10:59.211 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>mike was talking after the fight and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2908
02:11:01.161 --> 02:11:01.791
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2909
02:11:01.791 --> 02:11:02.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2910
02:11:02.011 --> 02:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over and eat and they step back,</v>

2911
02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>but when he goes home and he's alone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cameras are off and he's got vertigo</v>

2912
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:13.033
<v Speaker 1>and he's got an equilibrium problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ears won't stop ringing in and his </v>

2913
02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:17.540
<v Speaker 1>head won't stop throbbing.</v>

2914
02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>

2915
02:11:19.791 --> 02:11:20.624
<v Speaker 1>His head's throb and his ears are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ringing and it was no internet back </v>

2916
02:11:22.761 --> 02:11:23.421
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder.</v>

2917
02:11:23.421 --> 02:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to hide nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a way.</v>

2918
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:27.253
<v Speaker 1>Got your daily thing that you do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that your followers and they </v>

2919
02:11:29.341 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 1>all know your daily thing and you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>can build the daily things.</v>

2920
02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:34.940
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows he disappeared.</v>

2921
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:38.370
<v Speaker 1>No one really knew you lost the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never really see him again.</v>

2922
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 1>When you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also like when you're suffering alone,</v>

2923
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:42.103
<v Speaker 1>the only way people find out is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it like we don't know what </v>

2924
02:11:45.231 --> 02:11:47.780
<v Speaker 1>happens to a lot of these guys after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get beat the fuck up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cars all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigga murda of his sick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2977
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ALdo versus.</v>

2978
02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you see what happened </v>

2979
02:13:57.511 --> 02:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>with Michael Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael johnson stunned habib,</v>

2980
02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know he stung him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him and stung him.</v>

2981
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:03.683
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Johnson with all due respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>is nowhere near the striker that joseph </v>

2982
02:14:06.621 --> 02:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>aldo is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel dot.</v>

2983
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Joseph was on a totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josie is as powerful as johnson </v>

2984
02:14:10.650 --> 02:14:12.630
<v Speaker 1>explosive question because he's not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

2985
02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:13.643
<v Speaker 1>He's been fighting at 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole career and he's going to be </v>

2986
02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:16.764
<v Speaker 1>fighting a fucking go rilla they know </v>
<v Speaker 1>russian go really is a difference </v>

2987
02:14:21.451 --> 02:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>between johnson's bottom game and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those bottom 100 percent.</v>

2988
02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:26.413
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent will be way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those kicks there a giant factor </v>

2989
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.640
<v Speaker 1>because if aldo who has amazing takedown</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>

2990
02:14:35.641 --> 02:14:39.150

<v Speaker 1>some of the best takedown defense.</v>

2991
02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:43.140

<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>

2992
02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.500

<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>know who knows if I'll be for it,</v>

3049
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at like the,</v>

3050
02:17:10.550 --> 02:17:11.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3051
02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:12.393
<v Speaker 1>the title picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who that card that they have in </v>

3052
02:17:15.311 --> 02:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean That is,</v>

3053
02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:19.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a pay per view card and it looks </v>

3055
02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>They'll get more,</v>

02:17:24.610 --> 02:17:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Pay 60 bucks for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

3057
02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make those cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>

3058
02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I think we kind of nailed it when we </v>

3059
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:33.760

<v Speaker 1>He can't have him step in and just go </v>

3065
02:17:46.421 --> 02:17:48.940
<v Speaker 1>right up to the title and that's what I </v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's going to take the sports </v>

3069
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:55.054
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you give a guy who hasn't won </v>

3070
02:17:55.841 --> 02:17:58.420
<v Speaker 1>since 2011 or 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him a title shot.</v>

3071
02:17:58.421 --> 02:17:59.920
<v Speaker 1>People fans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on bro.</v>

3072
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 1>But I think they missed the boat if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make a fucking big money.</v>

3073
02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's nick diaz versus conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big brother.</v>

3074
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:11.350
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fight at one 70 some on.</v>

3075
02:18:11.370 --> 02:18:12.203
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

3076
02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:15.610
<v Speaker 1>His brother was too big for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's too big?</v>

3077
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:16.503
<v Speaker 1>way too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that talk is nonsense because </v>

3078
02:18:18.551 --> 02:18:20.260
<v Speaker 1>connor's the 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound champ.</v>

3079
02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Nate fought at 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of his career.</v>

3080
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:25.870
<v Speaker 1>He fought at one 70 a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's undersized.</v>

3081
02:18:25.871 --> 02:18:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Don young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim beat Him at one 70.</v>

3082
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:29.890
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit one.</v>

3083
02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Seventy year though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 70 maybe,</v>

3084
02:18:33.611 --> 02:18:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but he fights 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy look.</v>

3085
02:18:35.471 --> 02:18:36.304
<v Speaker 1>Great against Michael Mcdonald at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyron woodley if his fucking life </v>

3086
02:18:40.631 --> 02:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>depends on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyron woodley is not gonna.</v>

3087
02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Make it $55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The champ can't make 1:55</v>

3088
02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:47.560
<v Speaker 1>at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

3089
02:18:47.561 --> 02:18:49.890
<v Speaker 1>ken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nate is not a real one.</v>

3090
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:51.340
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's to your point,</v>

3091
02:18:51.341 --> 02:18:52.174
<v Speaker 1>in dana's point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to fight since 2011 and </v>

3092
02:18:53.651 --> 02:18:58.550
<v Speaker 1>ended up connor ger your cash cow fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THis monster isn't one forever.</v>

3093
02:18:58.551 --> 02:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

3094
02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Love big brother's steps in on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would watch it,</v>

3095
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to your.</v>

3096
02:19:06.551 --> 02:19:08.770
<v Speaker 1>To your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to figure something out to get</v>

3097
02:19:08.771 --> 02:19:11.200
<v Speaker 1>these stars it because you can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

3098
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:12.031
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

3099
02:19:12.031 --> 02:19:15.400
<v Speaker 1>You put nick diaz for what he's done out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of respect who's going to complain,</v>

3100
02:19:15.550 --> 02:19:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but apparently they offered nick diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbie lawler and nick passed on it.</v>

3101
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the word behind the scenes.</v>

3102
02:19:22.690 --> 02:19:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3103
02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not supposed to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3104
02:19:25.301 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see that rematch.</v>

3105
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:29.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think nick wants a fucking title </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

3106
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:31.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think nick is like,</v>

3107
02:19:31.221 --> 02:19:31.971
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a big,</v>

3108
02:19:31.971 --> 02:19:34.700
<v Speaker 1>big name or a title five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally make these demands.</v>

3109
02:19:35.490 --> 02:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Make nick made some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not ridiculous.</v>

3110
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:39.150
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't spend it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3111
02:19:39.151 --> 02:19:39.780
<v Speaker 1>how about nate?</v>

3112
02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:40.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not answEring the call and this is </v>

3113
02:19:41.601 --> 02:19:42.930
<v Speaker 1>20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3114
02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:43.813
<v Speaker 1>We talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that reCently in the </v>

3115
02:19:45.591 --> 02:19:46.281
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3116
02:19:46.281 --> 02:19:47.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's break this down because like,</v>

3117
02:19:47.961 --> 02:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>let's say they do a million pay per view</v>
<v Speaker 1>buys,</v>

3118
02:19:50.211 --> 02:19:51.620
<v Speaker 1>which is like top end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3119
02:19:51.621 --> 02:19:54.170
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few people that have ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold a millions like brock.</v>

3120
02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda conner set a million is top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the food chain,</v>

3121
02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.130
<v Speaker 1>so a million pay per view buys at 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

3122
02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's you're taking one third right off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bat.</v>

3123
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:05.323
<v Speaker 1>For nate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to jUstiFy giving </v>

3124
02:20:06.831 --> 02:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>someone $20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

3125
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be real hard and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously our Could demand.</v>

3126
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>That is like one of the only guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get that kind of money.</v>

3127
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:16.880
<v Speaker 1>He's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you guys?</v>

3128
02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You think eventually guys will just </v>
<v Speaker 1>start doing?</v>

3129
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so big.</v>

3130
02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:20.653
<v Speaker 1>Like connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just does his own show and he gets </v>

3131
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:23.294
<v Speaker 1>his own people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No use lawyers are too good to let you </v>

3132
02:20:24.681 --> 02:20:27.320
<v Speaker 1>get out of your contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realize that if,</v>

3133
02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:31.760
<v Speaker 1>if nate had a legit fight with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than connor,</v>

3134
02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:32.594
<v Speaker 1>that was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's no one else in </v>

3135
02:20:34.401 --> 02:20:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the division that's got that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marquee value.</v>

3136
02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:38.403
<v Speaker 1>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nO one in the division that has </v>

3137
02:20:39.261 --> 02:20:41.570
<v Speaker 1>the kind of marquee value that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a look,</v>

3138
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I think nate is a fucking huge star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in less than.</v>

3139
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Especially now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3140
02:20:46.011 --> 02:20:48.890
<v Speaker 1>after he beat conor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the biggest stars outside of</v>

3141
02:20:48.891 --> 02:20:51.590
<v Speaker 1>that upper echelon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paperview low level,</v>

3142
02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:54.350
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a world title holder right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3143
02:20:54.410 --> 02:20:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted to really have a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for nate,</v>

3144
02:20:58.330 --> 02:21:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I would have him fight a whole tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would work.</v>

3145
02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:02.870
<v Speaker 1>That would work.</v>

3146
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be ever come back.</v>

3147
02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Gsp apparently they couldn't work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal with the reebok deal.</v>

3148
02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got to deal with uNder armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a Big deal with under armour.</v>

3149
02:21:13.341 --> 02:21:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It makes a lot of money through under </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

3150
02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:16.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he couldn't work out a deal with </v>

3151
02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 1>that was worth it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3152
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:23.960
<v Speaker 1>there was an offer on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like it.</v>

3153
02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:26.930
<v Speaker 1>They're still talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stIll says he wants to fight,</v>

3154
02:21:26.931 --> 02:21:27.764
<v Speaker 1>but if the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that now that they've lost </v>

3155
02:21:30.651 --> 02:21:32.930
<v Speaker 1>rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely lost rhonda.</v>

3156
02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:34.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3157
02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not the same anymore.</v>

3158
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a tough sell.</v>

3159
02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:42.800
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucking knows a yeaR and a half down</v>

3160
02:21:42.801 --> 02:21:44.870
<v Speaker 1>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's still only 29.</v>

3161
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I think she's still get paper views if </v>
<v Speaker 1>she comes back on a year for sure,</v>

3162
02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:50.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same.</v>

3163
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit and money flows like water.</v>

3164
02:21:53.730 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 1>People will not want to watch it even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

3165
02:21:55.671 --> 02:21:56.504
<v Speaker 1>but she's not fighting anytime sooN so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't paint on her as stable going </v>

3166
02:21:59.710 --> 02:22:01.670
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to move on from it.</v>

3167
02:22:01.671 --> 02:22:02.504
<v Speaker 1>She comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3168
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3169
02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:05.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy sport.</v>

3171
02:22:07.311 --> 02:22:08.144
<v Speaker 1>It goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes down and moves all over the </v>

3172
02:22:09.351 --> 02:22:11.000
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every sports like this though.</v>

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it enhances</v>

3182
02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3183
02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:28.753
<v Speaker 3>your recovery from steroids because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduces estrogen psychotherapy for </v>

3184
02:22:32.251 --> 02:22:33.110
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3185
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:33.983
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also exists in a bunch of </v>

3186
02:22:36.331 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 3>different supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like over the counter stuff.</v>

3187
02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you arguing he wasn't taking?</v>

3188

02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:41.724
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is how much time do you </v>

3191
02:22:42.571 --> 02:22:43.404
<v Speaker 3>think they're going to give him off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much time are they going to </v>

3192
02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:48.540
<v Speaker 3>have times when we let him not do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests and beat up a guy,</v>

3193
02:22:48.570 --> 02:22:48.871
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3194
02:22:48.871 --> 02:22:50.820
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will have to do the usada test again.</v>

3195
02:22:50.821 --> 02:22:51.654
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get the last time he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a couple of exemptions where </v>

3196
02:22:53.761 --> 02:22:54.594
<v Speaker 3>they can get in on the four month thing </v>

<v Speaker 3>signed somebody.</v>

3198
02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:04.130

3408
02:33:13.410 --> 02:33:18.410
<v Speaker 7>We want to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want to hear that lady said,</v>

3409
02:33:24.801 --> 02:33:26.160
<v Speaker 7>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he said,</v>

3410
02:33:26.161 --> 02:33:26.760
<v Speaker 7>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>

3411
02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:28.590
<v Speaker 7>not much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but meanwhile you look at tyron.</v>

3412
02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:29.453
<v Speaker 7>Tyron looks so drain there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When he made that weight is like right </v>

3413
02:33:32.581 --> 02:33:37.020
<v Speaker 7>after you made the way he's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 7>for three.</v>

3414
02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:40.020
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody ever saw this shit.</v>

3415
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:42.690
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's not going to fight ferguson because</v>

3416
02:33:42.691 --> 02:33:45.750
<v Speaker 7>it's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a aerosmith.</v>

3417
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.823
<v Speaker 7>Guns and roses was aerosmith on steroids</v>
<v Speaker 7>and tony ferguson is little ds with </v>

3418
02:33:52.741 --> 02:33:56.790
<v Speaker 7>fucking blood in them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You understand me?</v>

3419
02:33:56.820 --> 02:34:01.820
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want tony ferguson and dana.</v>

3420
02:34:03.390 --> 02:34:08.390
<v Speaker 7>It's another whole John uncle bobby dana</v>
<v Speaker 7>is not going to let his nephew Fight.</v>

3421
02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:14.450
<v Speaker 7>Kidding connor versus is not a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a draw for connor.</v>

3422
02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:17.230
<v Speaker 7>he's your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a big fucking fight.</v>

3423
02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:18.213
<v Speaker 7>Make total</v>

3424
02:34:19.350 --> 02:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>though could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they're making it?</v>

3425
02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Eddie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

3426
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think it's not going to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love these guys.</v>

3427
02:34:30.130 --> 02:34:30.963
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

3428
02:34:30.970 --> 02:34:31.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a clown in your guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as the average consumer </v>

3429
02:34:34.511 --> 02:34:36.520
<v Speaker 1>buying a paper view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a sell.</v>

3430
02:34:36.521 --> 02:34:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just not hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3431
02:34:37.771 --> 02:34:38.604
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just of fighting somebody buddy cop </v>

3432
02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:44.880
<v Speaker 1>top challenger is always a sale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tony,</v>

3433
02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but tony ferguson is most certainly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>top challenger.</v>

3434
02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:50.840
<v Speaker 1>When nate dIaz fought conor for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

3435
02:34:50.841 --> 02:34:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a giant fight because nate diaz </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a name and he's a bit.</v>

3436
02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>He's a bigger name than tony arguably </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3437
02:34:57.850 --> 02:35:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger now after he beat for before</v>

3438
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:04.480
<v Speaker 1>others and tony wasn't the same as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>now either.</v>

3439
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing now,</v>

3440
02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3441
02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:07.793
<v Speaker 1>But he had it because of nick and nick </v>
<v Speaker 1>had had all the strikeforce success </v>

3442
02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:14.620
<v Speaker 1>elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see success,</v>

3443
02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you know all that is a lot of tv time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the ultimate fighter winner,</v>

3444
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:20.380
<v Speaker 1>nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

3445
02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:24.580
<v Speaker 1>nick just got done beaten anderson or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting anderson rather.</v>

3446
02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And you know nick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick is like a pretty well known figure.</v>

3447
02:35:28.050 --> 02:35:30.190
<v Speaker 1>These brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both the diaz brothers are like,</v>

3448
02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:34.570
<v Speaker 1>so that's a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having them take that fight on short</v>

3449
02:35:34.571 --> 02:35:36.550
<v Speaker 1>notice too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But connor was the main.</v>

3450
02:35:36.551 --> 02:35:41.551
<v Speaker 1>Draws my points because I agree it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the main draw.</v>

3451
02:35:44.130 --> 02:35:45.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're calm and you're his manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd go on,</v>

3452
02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:48.190
<v Speaker 1>let's fight tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a tough fucking matchup,</v>

3453
02:35:48.310 --> 02:35:53.140
<v Speaker 1>but he's not as big as the name as a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nate diaz at 55 who were gonna make</v>

3454
02:35:53.141 --> 02:35:53.974
<v Speaker 1>more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not as tough as a fight bigger </v>

3455
02:35:55.991 --> 02:35:56.824
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're doing it from a business </v>

3456
02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:01.210
<v Speaker 1>point and not fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fighting khabib.</v>

3457
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:03.360
<v Speaker 1>You also have to fight fightiNg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible fight for.</v>

3458
02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:06.370
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do a Russia card and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do a Russia card,</v>

3459
02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:09.220
<v Speaker 1>they want to do a Russia card with </v>
<v Speaker 1>connor or with hubby brother.</v>

3460
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:10.443
<v Speaker 1>So when they do a Russia car with habib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely going to be for a </v>

3461
02:36:13.241 --> 02:36:14.690
<v Speaker 1>title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

3462
02:36:14.691 --> 02:36:16.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what a title it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all depends if comment,</v>

3463
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 1>except that reminder might be tony and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my current interim,</v>

3464
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and apparently they offered it to tony </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tony said that he wanted to make the</v>

3465
02:36:23.831 --> 02:36:24.664
<v Speaker 1>same amount of money that habib bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly fine at first prep </v>

3466
02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:28.150
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3467
02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.013
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

3468
02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you got a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to honor your contract.</v>

3469
02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:34.120
<v Speaker 1>That's at least how it's been explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3470
02:36:34.121 --> 02:36:35.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's been explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

3471
02:36:35.231 --> 02:36:36.580
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you sign these contracts?</v>

3472
02:36:36.581 --> 02:36:38.080
<v Speaker 1>You got to honor the contract.</v>

3473
02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

3474
02:36:39.351 --> 02:36:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only works one way.</v>

3475
02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:44.570
<v Speaker 1>The only works for the ufc because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't honor all the contracts ready me.</v>

3476
02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:45.940
<v Speaker 1>If it works for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can cut them.</v>

3477
02:36:45.970 --> 02:36:48.490
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a six week contract plus two,</v>

3478
02:36:48.491 --> 02:36:49.324
<v Speaker 1>But that seems to cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the contract that you can get </v>

3479
02:36:51.311 --> 02:36:52.144
<v Speaker 1>cut if it wasn't in the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys who have fought and they </v>

3480
02:36:54.131 --> 02:36:56.320
<v Speaker 1>fought out their entire contract for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3481
02:36:56.610 --> 02:36:57.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the early days and pedro </v>

3482
02:36:59.891 --> 02:37:00.724
<v Speaker 1>huizar had this giant contract because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought that pedro is going to be </v>

3483
02:37:02.531 --> 02:37:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight champ and so they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving him like undercard fights.</v>

3484
02:37:05.141 --> 02:37:06.580
<v Speaker 1>He's making quarter of a miLlion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

3485
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3486
02:37:08.410 --> 02:37:09.243
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get the idea that they would </v>

3487
02:37:11.051 --> 02:37:13.560
<v Speaker 1>want to protect connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3488
02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:16.220
<v Speaker 1>and really set up the big fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially</v>

3489
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:19.750
<v Speaker 7>now because he's the biggest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then you've got connor who's kind of</v>

3490
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 7>fucking crazy and he's like the way he </v>
<v Speaker 7>was john [inaudible],</v>

3491
02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:25.590
<v Speaker 7>he gets caught or don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think from,</v>

3492
02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:27.350
<v Speaker 7>from a business standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going,</v>

3493
02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:30.260
<v Speaker 7>what's the biggest fight pot?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say you have three fights left.</v>

3494
02:37:30.261 --> 02:37:31.094
<v Speaker 7>Who were the three biggest names we can </v>
<v Speaker 7>fight and to make this happen so you </v>

3495
02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:35.690
<v Speaker 7>stay undefeated big and make the most </v>
<v Speaker 7>money.</v>

3496
02:37:35.691 --> 02:37:36.524
<v Speaker 7>He might not be under feet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's definitely not undefeated </v>

3497
02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:38.450
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3498
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:42.190
<v Speaker 7>But the biggest thing is the woodley </v>
<v Speaker 7>fight because that's a one seven.seven</v>

3499
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.550
<v Speaker 7>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a third belt guys.</v>

3500
02:37:43.551 --> 02:37:47.970
<v Speaker 7>That's a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As much control on your fuckers up.</v>

3501
02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:49.370
<v Speaker 7>You didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Number two,</v>

3502
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:50.443
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that khabib is going to </v>

3503
02:37:52.221 --> 02:37:53.054
<v Speaker 7>be kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially after I talked to take the </v>

3504
02:37:54.591 --> 02:37:56.530
<v Speaker 7>punch or michael kahn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying michael,</v>

3505
02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:57.793
<v Speaker 7>Michael Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the fight is khabib and then the </v>

3506
02:37:59.661 --> 02:38:01.100
<v Speaker 7>next fight has to be ferguson.</v>

3507
02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.580
<v Speaker 7>If he beats him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not just the way it is cooked.</v>

3508
02:38:03.850 --> 02:38:05.570
<v Speaker 7>ferguson came.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>

3509
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:06.433
<v Speaker 7>they can't wait like ferguson needs a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fight like in the next four or five </v>

3510
02:38:09.051 --> 02:38:09.884
<v Speaker 7>months.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It could be me as a fight in the next </v>

3511
02:38:11.170 --> 02:38:12.003
<v Speaker 7>two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three months.</v>

3512
02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:12.933
<v Speaker 7>I don't find in brooklyn from now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To what extent when you went to viewed </v>

3513
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:20.760
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>put the hat on your dad.</v>

3514
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:21.883
<v Speaker 7>He said he'll fight and brooke,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we put the hat on my head every time I </v>

3515
02:38:23.321 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 7>put every time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's great.</v>

3516
02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:28.150
<v Speaker 7>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He looks at me,</v>

3517
02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:30.160
<v Speaker 7>shows me that I give him the nod,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3518
02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:32.110
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll put that on the flood lights.</v>

3519
02:38:32.310 --> 02:38:37.310
<v Speaker 7>That had me as a fan is tony rush.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Lorenzo is legit as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nightmare.</v>

3586
02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:43.710
<v Speaker 3>He's a dangerous striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the best records in that 170</v>

3587
02:41:43.711 --> 02:41:47.130
<v Speaker 3>pound division and fought a good chunk </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his career at one 85.</v>

3588
02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:48.233
<v Speaker 3>One seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a big fella and he's got a </v>

3589
02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:51.023
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throWs that goddamn oh bleak kick to </v>

3590
02:41:52.891 --> 02:41:56.470
<v Speaker 3>the body better than anybody I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen him pull up the fight.</v>

3591
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lorenzo larkin versus neil maGni.</v>

3592
02:41:59.250 --> 02:42:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Neil magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a tough fucking dude.</v>

3593
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.350
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even have a chance in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3594
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Starch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat Johnny Hendricks.</v>

3595
02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:09.060
<v Speaker 3>The judge's helped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he beat.</v>

3596
02:42:09.470 --> 02:42:10.303
<v Speaker 3>Neil went in one and three in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he could have been conceivably </v>

3597
02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:17.250
<v Speaker 3>one because of having them in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle in the third.</v>

3598
02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:20.910
<v Speaker 3>But the first round was so loose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't look dangerous to me.</v>

3599
02:42:21.090 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 3>That was like a legit loose triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he.</v>

3600
02:42:22.831 --> 02:42:26.540
<v Speaker 3>But he still did more than john's muscle</v>
<v Speaker 3>biases fucked.</v>

3601
02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Who might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have to look at it again.</v>

3602
02:42:28.621 --> 02:42:29.640
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw some,</v>

3603
02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:31.073
<v Speaker 3>I saw some space and I think the arm was</v>
<v Speaker 3>tucked in enough where I don't think </v>

3604
02:42:33.751 --> 02:42:34.584
<v Speaker 3>johnny was like in real trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was definitely stuck thinking </v>

3605
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:39.020
<v Speaker 3>about those judges though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know shit.</v>

3606
02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:44.040
<v Speaker 3>They see him in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're given some serious motherfucking</v>

3607
02:42:44.041 --> 02:42:47.720
<v Speaker 3>danger anytime you're caught with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm and one on the mount and the shit as</v>

3608
02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:48.913
<v Speaker 3>cinched.</v>

3609
02:42:51.430 --> 02:42:52.263
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like your legs are so long </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like he gives you a little extra </v>

3610
02:42:54.961 --> 02:42:55.794
<v Speaker 3>space because his legs are so long was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem was pushed down and started </v>

3611
02:43:00.571 --> 02:43:01.404
<v Speaker 3>throwing elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when that does like his hands and </v>

3612
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:04.830
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it pushes them out.</v>

3613
02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:05.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>

3614
02:43:05.891 --> 02:43:06.724
<v Speaker 3>So the more you hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you gotta you gotta couple </v>

3615
02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:10.613
<v Speaker 3>farting up a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to land a couple of elbows </v>

3616
02:43:11.981 --> 02:43:14.230
<v Speaker 3>and then grab the wrist and pull them </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in.</v>

3617
02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:18.060
<v Speaker 3>You got to constantly pull back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw a couple more like this and yeah,</v>

3618
02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 3>but they remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pushing them out of your shit.</v>

3619
02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Remember when anderson stopped travis </v>
<v Speaker 3>luder.</v>

3620
02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:24.700
<v Speaker 3>That's how he got them locked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>DOn't miss.</v>

3621
02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could there have been a more frustrating</v>

3622
02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:28.151
<v Speaker 3>cut?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>

3623
02:43:28.151 --> 02:43:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Just ms dot dude was the closest I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen.</v>

3624
02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Where we're looking back.</v>

3625
02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:33.460
<v Speaker 3>The guy was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch thiS fight.</v>

3626
02:43:33.461 --> 02:43:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Here's the lorenzo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lorenzo is a slick striker,</v>

3627
02:43:36.371 --> 02:43:37.204
<v Speaker 3>but watch this oblique kick to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys are throwing this to the </v>

3628
02:43:40.241 --> 02:43:41.074
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lorens throws it to the body and he </v>

3629
02:43:42.881 --> 02:43:43.714
<v Speaker 3>switches stances a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way he lands it launches you </v>

3630
02:43:46.931 --> 02:43:49.450
<v Speaker 3>through the air with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he hits him with that low kick,</v>

3631
02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:53.070
<v Speaker 3>low kick on the bottom of the calf,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>

3633
02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just the fight itself,</v>

3634
02:43:57.610 --> 02:44:00.070
<v Speaker 3>but the way he throws it is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>unusual man,</v>

3635
02:44:00.071 --> 02:44:01.970
<v Speaker 3>because he'll be like from here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3645
02:44:13.151 --> 02:44:13.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>

3653
02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Whereas he lists his toes are pointing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See his toes are kind of pointing it now</v>

3654
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:30.310
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucks me up.</v>

3655
02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

3656
02:44:31.630 --> 02:44:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you on a Bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a devastating j.</v>

3657
02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Neil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about the fight.</v>

3658
02:44:34.750 --> 02:44:36.820
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally just overlooked the guy.</v>

3659
02:44:36.821 --> 02:44:39.160
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get a lot of hype,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he definitely should.</v>

3660
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:40.300
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overlooked.</v>

3661
02:44:40.301 --> 02:44:40.931
<v Speaker 3>Larkin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3662
02:44:40.931 --> 02:44:41.650
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3663
02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:42.880
<v Speaker 3>there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3664
02:44:42.890 --> 02:44:44.010
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't get a lot of hype.</v>

3665
02:44:44.190 --> 02:44:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Thought it was going to be an easier </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight than it was.</v>

3666
02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got off a beaten hector lombard.</v>

3667
02:44:48.401 --> 02:44:49.770
<v Speaker 3>He might've been feeling his oats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3668
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:50.643
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But larkin is a totally different </v>

3669
02:44:52.031 --> 02:44:52.330
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

3670
02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:53.860
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the most hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tough.</v>

3671
02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:57.190
<v Speaker 3>One of the most technical and a capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in the division.</v>

3672
02:44:57.191 --> 02:44:59.370
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to striking his jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3673
02:44:59.490 --> 02:45:00.760
<v Speaker 3>you see it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3674
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:03.700
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reducing his foot is not.</v>

3675
02:45:03.701 --> 02:45:06.500
<v Speaker 3>He's hitting with the heel like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is.</v>

3676
02:45:06.510 --> 02:45:08.770
<v Speaker 3>This is what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See how he does it there,</v>

3677
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:09.970
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sign who kicks like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like again,</v>

3679
02:45:14.050 --> 02:45:16.000
<v Speaker 3>back that up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to extension.</v>

3680
02:45:16.001 --> 02:45:17.500
<v Speaker 3>He gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

3681
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Watch how he throws this cake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a beautiful kick man.</v>

3682
02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:27.120
<v Speaker 3>He sets it up with that and then steps </v>
<v Speaker 3>in spartan style food.</v>

3683
02:45:27.780 --> 02:45:28.613
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird kick because a lot of guys </v>

3684
02:45:30.521 --> 02:45:34.060
<v Speaker 3>don't do it the way he does his stomping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and john does it all the time.</v>

3685
02:45:34.290 --> 02:45:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But john does it to the legs.</v>

3686
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It a lot to ronda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly did it to rhonda.</v>

3687
02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.880
<v Speaker 3>That's wiggled in instead of out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3688
02:45:42.881 --> 02:45:43.714
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you step forward and you do </v>

3689
02:45:45.221 --> 02:45:50.200
<v Speaker 3>this and it's got all the boys in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a bag,</v>

3690
02:45:50.201 --> 02:45:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you is the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he didn't invent it,</v>

3691
02:45:53.831 --> 02:45:56.950
<v Speaker 3>but they've been doing it forever </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>

3692
02:45:56.951 --> 02:45:59.200
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't doing it to the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to this degree though.</v>

3693
02:45:59.201 --> 02:46:02.350
<v Speaker 3>He fucking sparta kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rens is on another level.</v>

3694
02:46:02.351 --> 02:46:06.000
<v Speaker 3>He just is and the only loss that he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the octagon and one 70 is against</v>

3695
02:46:06.001 --> 02:46:06.834
<v Speaker 3>human off and that was a super close </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and he's not so he's not the only </v>

3696
02:46:09.831 --> 02:46:11.960
<v Speaker 3>guy that ever let him throw it exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3697
02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:15.830
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the only guys have ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it to the bottom and knock someone</v>

3698
02:46:15.831 --> 02:46:17.570
<v Speaker 3>down and the way he throws it to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

3699
02:46:17.571 --> 02:46:18.404
<v Speaker 3>just massive power and speed the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>chambers his legs and then gets that </v>

3700
02:46:23.121 --> 02:46:26.450
<v Speaker 3>kick to launch straight in a straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>line practices that right.</v>

3701
02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:27.413
<v Speaker 3>The guyS are doing now to guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue with this success kind of cat </v>

3702
02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.390
<v Speaker 3>league.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to see a thousand times before.</v>

3703
02:46:32.391 --> 02:46:34.490
<v Speaker 3>People don't make it part of their daily</v>
<v Speaker 3>routine,</v>

3704
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:35.473
<v Speaker 3>but he's fucking strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lorenzo flies under the radar like he </v>

3705
02:46:38.811 --> 02:46:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Wants more publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did it again.</v>

3706
02:46:42.141 --> 02:46:44.690
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it from here to the body,</v>

3707
02:46:44.691 --> 02:46:45.524
<v Speaker 3>which is so crazy nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine him versus Roy </v>

3708
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Macdonald?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bellatore I could.</v>

3709
02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:49.493
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can imagine him fighting for the </v>

3710
02:46:50.751 --> 02:46:55.280
<v Speaker 3>title against woodley too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see him at one 70 in the ufc.</v>

3711
02:46:55.281 --> 02:46:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I was selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his last record of the last?</v>

3712
02:46:57.890 --> 02:46:58.723
<v Speaker 3>The last one off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a razor close decision that </v>

3713
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:02.790
<v Speaker 3>recent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3714
02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:05.440
<v Speaker 3>that was like two or three fights ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's won all the other ones.</v>

3715
02:47:05.490 --> 02:47:07.520
<v Speaker 3>He's a monster on a winning streak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YeaH.</v>

3716
02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:08.353
<v Speaker 3>But this is the big win because </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnesium a top contender and he beat </v>

3717
02:47:10.491 --> 02:47:11.480
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of magna.</v>

3718
02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Magna was never in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fight was,</v>

3719
02:47:14.470 --> 02:47:15.303
<v Speaker 3>it was like he worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man magnet has really only been out </v>

3720
02:47:17.591 --> 02:47:20.480
<v Speaker 3>class in this larkin fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he got out class when he fought</v>

3721
02:47:20.481 --> 02:47:23.720
<v Speaker 3>demian maia larkin throws a lot of weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to throw,</v>

3722
02:47:23.721 --> 02:47:24.554
<v Speaker 3>like we'll kicks to the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he came into rain and everyone was </v>

3723
02:47:26.871 --> 02:47:27.350
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3724
02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:28.960
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

3725
02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:31.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and pat couldn't get them down.</v>

3726
02:47:31.011 --> 02:47:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Is take down a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was ridiculous.</v>

3727
02:47:32.810 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 3>His striking was unconventional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a nightmare.</v>

3728
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a,</v>

3729
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:37.063
<v Speaker 3>I think a kung fu background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where he started his </v>

3730
02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:42.380
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see like that low leg kick,</v>

3731
02:47:42.381 --> 02:47:44.830
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes he attacks like below the knee.</v>

3732
02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:46.370
<v Speaker 3>We can Just do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll up.</v>

3733
02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:51.480
<v Speaker 3>As far as the sweet spot with the take </v>
<v Speaker 3>down defense to speed magnet pulls.</v>

3734
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>caLiber going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

<v Speaker 3>money or do I stay in the ufc?</v>

3738

<v Speaker 3>career and no one will know who you are.</v>

<v Speaker 3>caliber.</v>

3755
02:48:30.830 --> 02:48:33.670
<v Speaker 3>He walks down The street in the seVen 11</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>

3756
02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you a crossfit?</v>

3757
02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:36.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

3758
02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:39.290
<v Speaker 3>He was in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows who he is.</v>

3759
02:48:39.291 --> 02:48:39.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3760
02:48:39.771 --> 02:48:41.840
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not there yet.</v>

3761
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I Wish they can get there though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know man.</v>

3762
02:48:44.451 --> 02:48:45.284
<v Speaker 3>They don't have paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have like those you need </v>

3763
02:48:47.850 --> 02:48:50.600
<v Speaker 3>spike tv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same.</v>

3764
02:48:50.810 --> 02:48:53.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just what they're putting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I w I agree,</v>

3765
02:48:53.310 --> 02:48:54.143
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've tried one paper view was a </v>

3766
02:48:55.911 --> 02:48:57.460
<v Speaker 3>terrible disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was the paper?</v>

3767
02:48:57.461 --> 02:48:58.880
<v Speaker 3>You the rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember?</v>

3768
02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I do remember me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just mark.</v>

3769
02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Nobody bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3770
02:49:03.370 --> 02:49:04.550
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference.</v>

3771
02:49:04.570 --> 02:49:07.590
<v Speaker 3>But their ratings on regular cable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3772
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Just as good as the use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's weird is their ratings on regular</v>

3773
02:49:10.891 --> 02:49:12.990
<v Speaker 3>cable still don't translate into </v>
<v Speaker 3>stardom.</v>

3774
02:49:13.530 --> 02:49:14.363
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because I think what they've been </v>

3775
02:49:17.011 --> 02:49:20.850
<v Speaker 3>doing is they've been getting the older </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys from the ufc where people are like,</v>

3776
02:49:20.980 --> 02:49:21.813
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of over the hill where now </v>

3777
02:49:23.401 --> 02:49:24.234
<v Speaker 3>they have a guy like Roy Mcdonald who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was young and he can be that kind of </v>

3778
02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:32.690
<v Speaker 3>world class athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the replay of a wonderboy fucking up</v>

3779
02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:33.120
<v Speaker 3>rory.</v>

3780
02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what they show over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over agaIn,</v>

3781
02:49:34.801 --> 02:49:35.634
<v Speaker 3>and then they show robby lauer knocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out rory and they'll just show it over </v>

3782
02:49:38.371 --> 02:49:39.204
<v Speaker 3>and over again in their highlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>through till everybody knows rory left </v>

3783
02:49:42.050 --> 02:49:43.110
<v Speaker 3>and went over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

3784
02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I wish nothing but the best until it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets like a michael venom page.</v>

3785
02:49:47.881 --> 02:49:48.714
<v Speaker 3>Let's say he just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they get one superstar like a jon </v>

3786
02:49:51.001 --> 02:49:51.834
<v Speaker 3>jones who started with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to start seeing some </v>

3787
02:49:53.761 --> 02:49:55.680
<v Speaker 3>gnh got kind of exposed in his last </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3788
02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:58.490
<v Speaker 3>What happened on the distance did knock </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy out,</v>

3789
02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:00.750
<v Speaker 3>didn't really look that good and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer,</v>

3790
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:01.783
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying they need a type of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who he fought because the the </v>

3791
02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:07.830
<v Speaker 3>chill zone in versteeg ortiz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll do record breaking.</v>

3792
02:50:07.860 --> 02:50:11.490
<v Speaker 3>It's going to kill number wise because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know who those guYs are both older.</v>

3793
02:50:11.610 --> 02:50:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to sell for sure.</v>

3794
02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not selling?</v>

3795
02:50:14.101 --> 02:50:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a regular tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3796
02:50:15.690 --> 02:50:16.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3797
02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:17.513
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna say it's gonna sell ticket </v>

3798
02:50:18.211 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 3>wise at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because remember,</v>

3799
02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:25.100
<v Speaker 3>remember that brooklyn card was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be at the same time as as that a belt</v>

3800
02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.520
<v Speaker 3>or card use left because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a headliner for that.</v>

3801
02:50:29.521 --> 02:50:31.980
<v Speaker 3>So they left anaheim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that same night?</v>

3802
02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Is that where it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3803
02:50:34.621 --> 02:50:37.040
<v Speaker 3>well that's the brooklyn card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moved back to brooklyn.</v>

3804
02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:38.250
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3805
02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:39.243
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that brooklyn card does</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like they're still working on it </v>

3806
02:50:42.451 --> 02:50:44.180
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that they could pull that.</v>

3807
02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:47.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a smart room because like tito </v>
<v Speaker 3>chill and we got fucking holly this like</v>

3808
02:50:47.730 --> 02:50:49.800
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the same weekend.</v>

3809
02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the remainder randomly.</v>

3810
02:50:53.390 --> 02:50:54.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they switched it,</v>

3811
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:58.170
<v Speaker 3>but it was the same as bellatore belt </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards January 21st on spike.</v>

3812
02:50:58.290 --> 02:50:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3813
02:50:59.161 --> 02:51:02.080
<v Speaker 3>So february.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they switched it to that february.</v>

3814
02:51:02.550 --> 02:51:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Can dos santos rescheduled that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3815
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:07.980
<v Speaker 3>we'll do for doom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was supposed to fight cain,</v>

3816
02:51:07.981 --> 02:51:11.000
<v Speaker 3>but cain got pulled off the card because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fucked up man.</v>

3817
02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:11.853
<v Speaker 3>He did an interview and said that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed surgery after the fight and they </v>

3818
02:51:14.231 --> 02:51:15.390
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3819
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:16.583
<v Speaker 3>so you know bob baker from the Nevada </v>
<v Speaker 3>state athletic commission who does </v>

3820
02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:21.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking awesome job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is not going to let you fight.</v>

3821
02:51:21.991 --> 02:51:23.760
<v Speaker 3>If you go around telling people that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need surgery,</v>

3822
02:51:23.770 --> 02:51:26.340
<v Speaker 3>what's your liability?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a liability business.</v>

3823
02:51:26.341 --> 02:51:28.650
<v Speaker 3>One-on-one came and you just can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3824
02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:30.450
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably didn't think about it.</v>

3825
02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:31.313
<v Speaker 3>He just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3826
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to show everybody how </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough I am and go through it anyway,</v>

3827
02:51:34.050 --> 02:51:34.883
<v Speaker 3>which you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if the thing is his back is </v>

3828
02:51:36.931 --> 02:51:38.670
<v Speaker 3>structurally sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doctors cleared him,</v>

3829
02:51:38.671 --> 02:51:41.130
<v Speaker 3>so if he did like he thought in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

3830
02:51:41.131 --> 02:51:43.770
<v Speaker 3>even though he does need to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathways cleared out,</v>

3831
02:51:43.771 --> 02:51:47.370
<v Speaker 3>he's got some sort of stenosis where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pathways to the nerves,</v>

3832
02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:50.160
<v Speaker 3>it's irritating as nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can get a cortisone shot.</v>

3833
02:51:50.180 --> 02:51:51.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets a cortisone shot.</v>

3834
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Then he won't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can go through the fight.</v>

3835
02:51:54.211 --> 02:51:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Structurally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fine.</v>

3836
02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:57.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he's compromised and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a weak joint,</v>

3837
02:51:57.720 --> 02:51:59.280
<v Speaker 3>so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a little bit of pain.</v>

3838
02:51:59.460 --> 02:52:00.293
<v Speaker 3>He goes through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then after the fight he can get the </v>

3839
02:52:01.741 --> 02:52:03.120
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his doctor said.</v>

3840
02:52:03.121 --> 02:52:03.954
<v Speaker 3>So that's what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't take consideration that </v>

3841
02:52:05.801 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 3>whenever</v>

3842
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:09.250
<v Speaker 5>you say two things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all the betting line changes.</v>

3843
02:52:09.490 --> 02:52:12.360
<v Speaker 5>You go and Tell everybody needs surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After the fight there was a role,</v>

3844
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:14.860
<v Speaker 5>so that gets squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially with Nevada.</v>

3845
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:15.723
<v Speaker 5>They have to figure out how they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they put thIs lineup and second of </v>

3846
02:52:17.861 --> 02:52:20.620
<v Speaker 5>all there's the liability thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's huge liability.</v>

3847
02:52:20.770 --> 02:52:21.603
<v Speaker 5>And then did you see they did offer the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight of junior dos santos and then for </v>

3848
02:52:24.451 --> 02:52:25.284
<v Speaker 5>doom came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I call calling junior dos santos gay </v>

3849
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:29.270
<v Speaker 5>and it was like just come out the closet</v>
<v Speaker 5>said nothing.</v>

3850
02:52:29.271 --> 02:52:31.030
<v Speaker 5>It's homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everyone knows you're gay.</v>

3851
02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:33.220
<v Speaker 5>damn son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he say that?</v>

3852
02:52:33.250 --> 02:52:36.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went hard in the paint at jds.</v>

3853
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:37.150
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's rough.</v>

3854
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Super rough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you see johnson?</v>

3855
02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:43.690
<v Speaker 5>That's not horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anytime soon.</v>

3856
02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:45.700
<v Speaker 5>Dc's just getting back to training on </v>
<v Speaker 5>monday,</v>

3857
02:52:45.740 --> 02:52:48.430
<v Speaker 5>dc had a torn muscle and he decided to </v>
<v Speaker 5>opt for surgery,</v>

3858
02:52:48.431 --> 02:52:49.264
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3911
02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:58.800

<v Speaker 5>at 1:47.</v>

3912
02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.690

<v Speaker 3>This is the best one.</v>

3921
02:55:15.111 --> 02:55:17.630
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a strong statement at his age.</v>

3922
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:20.240
<v Speaker 3>You know when I'm at the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3923
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're saying.</v>

3924
02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:27.390
<v Speaker 3>He has a great camp shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sticking around with dj.</v>

3925
02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't you get ate up?</v>

3926
02:55:29.890 --> 02:55:30.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 38 years old though and that's 38 </v>

3927
02:55:33.861 --> 02:55:37.280
<v Speaker 3>mma years in 38 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes some doors.</v>

3928
02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty goddamn stepson.</v>

3929
02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:45.930
<v Speaker 3>He's a mad scramble or fly to a knee </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>

3930
02:55:45.950 --> 02:55:46.783
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's black or brown belt </v>

3931
02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:51.860
<v Speaker 3>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rodriguez,</v>

3932
02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:53.090
<v Speaker 3>bjj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rank.</v>

3933
02:55:53.091 --> 02:55:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3934
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Find that jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3935
02:55:55.530 --> 02:55:58.100
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing about your year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distance.</v>

3936
02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:00.850
<v Speaker 3>He keeps that kicking distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking,</v>

3937
02:56:01.270 --> 02:56:06.110
<v Speaker 3>he's lethal on the beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quickness and stands with them.</v>

3938
02:56:06.170 --> 02:56:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The odds are not in his favor,</v>

3939
02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:13.730
<v Speaker 3>but if bj just decides to take it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that clinch and take them down,</v>

3940
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:17.480
<v Speaker 3>squeeze them out and jump on his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tHink that's the best route.</v>

3941
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Not hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got it.</v>

3942
02:56:19.730 --> 02:56:23.300
<v Speaker 3>He's got to take rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like bj.</v>

3943
02:56:23.301 --> 02:56:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Verse llamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is the legend,</v>

3944
02:56:25.971 --> 02:56:26.361
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

3945
02:56:26.361 --> 02:56:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Ricardo lamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carnal lumps a bad motherfucker.</v>

3946
02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was here.</v>

3947
02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:33.590
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't like that.</v>

3948
02:56:33.591 --> 02:56:35.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't think your year's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt you in the same way.</v>

3949
02:56:35.451 --> 02:56:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Ricardo is jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

3950
02:56:36.891 --> 02:56:37.724
<v Speaker 3>did you see the touchy feely fight when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he launched that fucking flying </v>

3951
02:56:39.621 --> 02:56:41.990
<v Speaker 3>roundhouse kick to his jaw and flattened</v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

3952
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Those are good points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

3953
02:56:44.181 --> 02:56:46.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the llamas fight for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3954
02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I think they're both equally scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about pharmacists,</v>

3955
02:56:50.381 --> 02:56:53.180
<v Speaker 3>llamas has more experience against world</v>
<v Speaker 3>class competition.</v>

3956
02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Went five rounds with aldo and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating aldo in the fifth round and good</v>

3957
02:56:57.970 --> 02:56:58.803
<v Speaker 3>ground and pounding him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a nasty kia team to team </v>

3958
02:57:01.460 --> 02:57:03.260
<v Speaker 3>bermuda has cracked him to the punch and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

3959
02:57:03.270 --> 02:57:06.470
<v Speaker 3>and then snuck in that tight arm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>guillotine.</v>

3960
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:09.140
<v Speaker 3>He's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Llamas is one of the best guys.</v>

3961
02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.100
<v Speaker 3>But he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3962
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:11.023
<v Speaker 3>34,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 do anything for bj that [inaudible] </v>

3963
02:57:13.130 --> 02:57:13.963
<v Speaker 3>and lama's is such a bad as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So skilled that doesn't do much for bj </v>

3964
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:19.070
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least a year if he wins,</v>

3965
02:57:19.130 --> 02:57:20.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's young.</v>

3966
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:23.810
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge feather in his cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes more sense I guess.</v>

3967
02:57:23.811 --> 02:57:26.540
<v Speaker 3>But if bj beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if bj beat lama.</v>

3968
02:57:26.541 --> 02:57:28.370
<v Speaker 3>So it was a big feather in his calves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jesus,</v>

3969
02:57:28.371 --> 02:57:32.480
<v Speaker 3>he beat a top 10 contender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fought forever to us.</v>

3970
02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:34.160
<v Speaker 3>But what do you mean to anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3971
02:57:34.161 --> 02:57:35.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing about,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I think you Just have to let people know</v>

4086
03:03:18.131 --> 03:03:19.510
<v Speaker 6>what's in them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's 10.</v>

4087
03:03:19.570 --> 03:03:20.410
<v Speaker 6>10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4088
03:03:20.411 --> 03:03:22.420
<v Speaker 6>so you can adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Each one will be 10.</v>

4089
03:03:22.570 --> 03:03:26.590
<v Speaker 6>Like in denver they were selling these </v>
<v Speaker 6>like containers of 10.</v>

4090
03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:27.593
<v Speaker 6>It was 100 milligrams and they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>these gum drops and each one of them is </v>

4091
03:03:29.981 --> 03:03:32.470
<v Speaker 6>10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're pretty consistent but,</v>

4092
03:03:32.530 --> 03:03:35.800
<v Speaker 6>but not totally consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I ate one.</v>

4093
03:03:35.801 --> 03:03:36.401
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4094
03:03:36.401 --> 03:03:37.234
<v Speaker 6>it feels like 10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then another one that felt like 40 </v>

4095
03:03:39.221 --> 03:03:40.480
<v Speaker 6>or 50.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4096
03:03:40.490 --> 03:03:41.323
<v Speaker 6>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this one,</v>

4097
03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:43.030
<v Speaker 6>they don't have the real numbers.</v>

4098
03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:43.953
<v Speaker 6>Not if you bring that cushy to you and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll make you eat the whole thing and </v>

4099
03:03:46.931 --> 03:03:48.970
<v Speaker 6>you'll go joey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not 100 milligrams.</v>

4100
03:03:49.050 --> 03:03:51.220
<v Speaker 6>they lied to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the case.</v>

4101
03:03:51.221 --> 03:03:52.054
<v Speaker 6>often though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like it's hard to get real </v>

4102
03:03:54.101 --> 03:03:54.934
<v Speaker 6>accurate testing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then also like who's doing the </v>

4103
03:03:57.050 --> 03:04:00.840
<v Speaker 6>actual making and blend akin to </v>
<v Speaker 6>measurements.</v>

4104
03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:02.910
<v Speaker 6>Like tomorrow I pick up my shipment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the attic,</v>

4105
03:04:02.911 --> 03:04:05.270
<v Speaker 6>he edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are my home run my shipment.</v>

4106

<v Speaker 6>every monday before jujitsu,</v>

4107
03:04:10.430 --> 03:04:13.280
<v Speaker 6>about 10:45,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gives me 100,</v>

4108
03:04:13.350 --> 03:04:15.260
<v Speaker 6>200 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 6>100 red ones.</v>

4109
03:04:15.261 --> 03:04:16.094
<v Speaker 6>And a couple brownies brownies away to </v>
<v Speaker 6>my friends and I keep those for the </v>

4110
03:04:19.221 --> 03:04:20.054
<v Speaker 6>podcast when I fly and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then you have to get used to the </v>

4111
03:04:23.601 --> 03:04:25.530
<v Speaker 6>same strain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like marijuana.</v>

4112
03:04:25.531 --> 03:04:27.410
<v Speaker 6>If you smoke the same training for three</v>
<v Speaker 6>days,</v>

4113
03:04:27.650 --> 03:04:30.130
<v Speaker 6>it's not going to get you as high as the</v>
<v Speaker 6>first day because you're telling them to</v>

4114
03:04:30.170 --> 03:04:31.500
<v Speaker 6>build to that strange.</v>

4115
03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:35.090
<v Speaker 6>So I make some match bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm the only ones that allowed to mr.</v>

4116
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:38.030
<v Speaker 6>Uncle joe is neighborhood a cushy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cushy,</v>

4117
03:04:38.540 --> 03:04:43.540
<v Speaker 6>the tko brilliant fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that new rocket pocket,</v>

4118
03:04:44.310 --> 03:04:47.990
<v Speaker 6>that rocket chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that shit dog twice.</v>

4119
03:04:47.991 --> 03:04:50.810
<v Speaker 6>I read them already and I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 6>the next day I get up,</v>

4120
03:04:50.811 --> 03:04:52.880
<v Speaker 6>I take the baby to school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ride a little bit.</v>

4121
03:04:53.270 --> 03:04:55.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm like 10:30.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then nothing going on.</v>

4122
03:04:55.460 --> 03:04:57.800
<v Speaker 6>I got to go right back to bed for four </v>
<v Speaker 6>or five hours.</v>

4123
03:04:57.810 --> 03:05:02.510
<v Speaker 6>Don't fucked up the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's gonna be a time in our lifetimes</v>

4124
03:05:02.511 --> 03:05:05.390
<v Speaker 6>where they start passing medical </v>
<v Speaker 6>psilocybin.</v>

4125
03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:08.690
<v Speaker 6>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when they have medical psilocybin,</v>

4126
03:05:08.691 --> 03:05:11.330
<v Speaker 6>eventually they're going to go with </v>
<v Speaker 6>recreational psilocybin.</v>

4127
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:13.330
<v Speaker 6>And when they go with recreational </v>
<v Speaker 6>suicide,</v>

4128
03:05:13.331 --> 03:05:15.410
<v Speaker 6>when we're going to see a different </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

4129
03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:17.180
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be a different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

4130
03:05:17.181 --> 03:05:19.250
<v Speaker 6>But the same benefits that you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 6>with marijuana,</v>

4131
03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:22.450
<v Speaker 6>the difference being that marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least when you're smoking it,</v>

4132
03:05:22.451 --> 03:05:26.510
<v Speaker 6>it's easier to regulate the experiences </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so world changing and dissolving.</v>

4133
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:28.970
<v Speaker 6>But we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna have freedom.</v>

4134
03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:30.650
<v Speaker 6>It'S not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not here yet,</v>

4135
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:33.620
<v Speaker 6>but it's here now for pot in a way </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's never been before.</v>

4136
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:34.483
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think once a big pharma goes 100 </v>

4137
03:05:37.911 --> 03:05:38.744
<v Speaker 6>percent in a cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what kinds of things do you think </v>

4138
03:05:42.591 --> 03:05:45.440
<v Speaker 6>they'll do to squeeze out the small </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys?</v>

4139
03:05:45.441 --> 03:05:46.700
<v Speaker 6>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4140
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:47.730
<v Speaker 6>They've already done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They tried.</v>

4141
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:50.000
<v Speaker 6>They could make it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4142
03:05:50.001 --> 03:05:52.250
<v Speaker 6>Now it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're the only ones that get.</v>

4143
03:05:52.770 --> 03:05:55.340
<v Speaker 6>Jamie wanted me to sell it if you're on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your own,</v>

4144
03:05:55.341 --> 03:05:57.590
<v Speaker 6>was that deal in Ohio and that seems </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4145
03:05:57.800 --> 03:06:00.500
<v Speaker 6>like what's going to happen eventually?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The big businesses,</v>

4146
03:06:00.980 --> 03:06:03.620
<v Speaker 6>they're going to squeeze everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to pass regulation.</v>

4147
03:06:03.621 --> 03:06:04.311
<v Speaker 6>JaMie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4148
03:06:04.311 --> 03:06:05.144
<v Speaker 6>They were trying to like lock down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I think it was like for coMpAnies </v>

4149
03:06:08.251 --> 03:06:09.084
<v Speaker 6>that would have been able to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll grow or sell or I think it was in </v>

4150
03:06:12.111 --> 03:06:13.620
<v Speaker 6>perpetuity forever.</v>

4151
03:06:14.540 --> 03:06:18.560
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're going to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 6>people like a regular person.</v>

4152
03:06:18.561 --> 03:06:21.380
<v Speaker 6>there's money in regular people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can they make like sick?</v>

4153
03:06:21.381 --> 03:06:23.120
<v Speaker 6>Can they start their own cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 6>companies?</v>

4154
03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:24.320
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can they do that?</v>

4155
03:06:24.490 --> 03:06:25.700
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good question.</v>

4156
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:27.290
<v Speaker 6>Getting to the cigarette company.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4157
03:06:27.340 --> 03:06:28.580
<v Speaker 6>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4158
03:06:28.581 --> 03:06:29.271
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

4159
03:06:29.271 --> 03:06:30.104
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't hear about people making </v>

4160
03:06:32.391 --> 03:06:33.224
<v Speaker 6>their own cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You make your own wines and make your </v>

4161
03:06:34.851 --> 03:06:35.684
<v Speaker 6>own cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you buy your own tobacco and you can </v>

4162
03:06:36.861 --> 03:06:37.694
<v Speaker 6>roll your own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But as far as like going into large </v>

4163
03:06:39.081 --> 03:06:40.040
<v Speaker 6>scale production,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4164
03:06:40.041 --> 03:06:41.170
<v Speaker 6>you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4165
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:43.130
<v Speaker 6>The thing when you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>marijuana thing,</v>

4166
03:06:43.131 --> 03:06:45.860
<v Speaker 6>it's like you already know how easy it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is to grow you fucks,</v>

4167
03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:47.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that they tried to lock it down</v>

4168
03:06:47.991 --> 03:06:50.360
<v Speaker 6>and make it so only a few companies can </v>
<v Speaker 6>grow it,</v>

4169
03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:53.240
<v Speaker 6>make it legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but only a few people can profit off it.</v>

4170
03:06:53.241 --> 03:06:56.010
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then then they make it so god</v>

4171
03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:59.550
<v Speaker 3>cheaped at that you've grown yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to sell it yourself.</v>

4172
03:06:59.551 --> 03:07:00.384
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't become an option </v>

4173
03:07:01.831 --> 03:07:02.820
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

4174
03:07:02.821 --> 03:07:04.080
<v Speaker 3>People just say fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4175
03:07:04.081 --> 03:07:07.590
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to get cheap ass weed</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the liquor store,</v>

4176
03:07:07.591 --> 03:07:08.424
<v Speaker 3>at the gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're just after a generation or </v>

4177
03:07:10.801 --> 03:07:11.634
<v Speaker 3>two people forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be like a kind of sewer thing in </v>

4178
03:07:14.101 --> 03:07:15.900
<v Speaker 3>the fucking 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 minutes.</v>

4179
03:07:15.930 --> 03:07:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Did a show one time and they showed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all already in the seventies.</v>

4180
03:07:20.460 --> 03:07:23.130
<v Speaker 3>The cigarette companies already had </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms set up.</v>

4181
03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:25.920
<v Speaker 3>They were already working on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>packaging.</v>

4182
03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the seventies,</v>

4183
03:07:27.601 --> 03:07:29.030
<v Speaker 3>they were already trying to legalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

4184
03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:30.810
<v Speaker 3>The cigarette companies were already in </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

4185
03:07:31.410 --> 03:07:32.243
<v Speaker 3>Right now we don't think all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cigarette companies are setting </v>

4186
03:07:34.441 --> 03:07:36.510
<v Speaker 3>up that Kentucky was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're from Kentucky.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was saying that that's the issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>that those big cigarette companies are </v>

4199
03:08:10.681 --> 03:08:13.890
<v Speaker 3>buying up so much shit to make it hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>for other people get involved in.</v>

4200
03:08:14.490 --> 03:08:15.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they already have their hand in </v>

4201
03:08:18.540 --> 03:08:23.540
<v Speaker 3>something that's selling like hotcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually the small,</v>

4202
03:08:24.450 --> 03:08:27.400
<v Speaker 3>the small man gets cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4203
03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens a lot.</v>

4204
03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:29.793
<v Speaker 3>Certainly happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's anything regulations </v>

4205
03:08:33.210 --> 03:08:34.043
<v Speaker 3>where you know they can profit and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can use their influence and fuck over </v>

4206
03:08:37.561 --> 03:08:38.990
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That also could probably relate.</v>

4207
03:08:39.050 --> 03:08:43.110
<v Speaker 3>The problem with pot is it's so god damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to grow that if they don't do that,</v>

4208
03:08:43.380 --> 03:08:44.430
<v Speaker 3>anybody could step in.</v>

4209
03:08:44.610 --> 03:08:48.240
<v Speaker 3>But what they were trying to do in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lock it down for perpetuity forever.</v>

4210
03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:49.193
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these companies could be the only </v>

4211
03:08:50.251 --> 03:08:52.890
<v Speaker 3>ones they're set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're setting up monarchies.</v>

4212
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.781
<v Speaker 3>Common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4213
03:08:54.781 --> 03:08:56.880
<v Speaker 3>that's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't heard the end of that shit.</v>

4214
03:08:56.881 --> 03:08:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Hell no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's coming.</v>

4215
03:08:58.170 --> 03:08:59.003
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be interesting when trump's </v>

4216
03:08:59.641 --> 03:09:00.474
<v Speaker 3>the president now see where they go with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this because that jeff sessions got </v>

4217
03:09:02.871 --> 03:09:04.950
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's bringing in that guy hates box.</v>

4218
03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:07.170
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to let these hippies </v>
<v Speaker 3>make millions of dollars.</v>

4219
03:09:07.171 --> 03:09:08.004
<v Speaker 3>That's only going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are going to be considered the </v>

4220
03:09:09.211 --> 03:09:10.044
<v Speaker 3>good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to wish you was never </v>

4221
03:09:11.851 --> 03:09:13.830
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

4222
03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:16.140
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be interesting to.</v>

4223
03:09:16.170 --> 03:09:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Trump has said that he's going to leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up to the states,</v>

4224
03:09:18.330 --> 03:09:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but presidents always say shit that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do.</v>

4225
03:09:21.450 --> 03:09:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean obama was going to close down </v>
<v Speaker 3>guantanamo bay.</v>

4226
03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.070
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker still open eight years</v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

4227
03:09:26.130 --> 03:09:29.520
<v Speaker 3>He never even made an attempt at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes they say that stuff.</v>

4228
03:09:29.521 --> 03:09:31.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize how much work goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

4229
03:09:31.111 --> 03:09:31.891
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4230
03:09:31.891 --> 03:09:32.724
<v Speaker 3>I think they say that and then they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into office and then they get handed </v>

4231
03:09:35.881 --> 03:09:39.920
<v Speaker 3>some dossiers and some fucking briefings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they understand like he went like,</v>

4232
03:09:39.930 --> 03:09:41.700
<v Speaker 3>this is why we haven't done like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4233
03:09:41.701 --> 03:09:42.534
<v Speaker 3>I know you were saying you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>close down [inaudible] bay because it </v>

4234
03:09:45.031 --> 03:09:45.864
<v Speaker 3>helps your campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to get you in here and </v>

<v Speaker 3>They didn't sit them down.</v>

4236
03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:52.770
<v Speaker 3>They knew that shit way before they knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were getting into.</v>

4237
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the only reason they were allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to rise so high.</v>

4238
03:09:56.230 --> 03:09:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I think they say a bunch of shit to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the office.</v>

4239
03:09:58.571 --> 03:10:00.400
<v Speaker 3>They say whatever the fuck they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know for sure.</v>
