41
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>They pop it in the butter and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might even sprinkle some butter on top</v>

42
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some cannabis butter and fuck you up.</v>

45
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>bags of that popcorn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I would understand if you could do</v>

<v Speaker 1>just fall down the steps.</v>

205
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to do that to me.</v>

206
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.133
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

207
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do.</v>

208
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean it's what I do.</v>

209
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you a stunt man?</v>

210
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd you hear that Echo?</v>

211
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>The comics told me that that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do besides comedy.</v>

212
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You're a stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes,</v>

213
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a stunt man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be thrown down.</v>

214
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't have you just towards me</v>

215
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 1>down a full flight of steps like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get hurt.</v>

216
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 1>So we had to do it in pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>which I like a fake fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

218
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go like halfway.</v>

219
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I go to the bottom of the steps</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the rest of the fall.</v>

220
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I tried to like kill him with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair and Ari Shaffir jumps on me at the</v>

221
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>right moment to stop me from killing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

222
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>It was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

223
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I could do just so I could do a line</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a bronx tale where I'm on top of</v>

224
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>him now.</v>

225
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.530

226
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will that mean?</v>

227
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

231
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.120

<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

232
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>look that way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's like two security guards stand</v>

389
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>behind them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>

394
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.340

<v Speaker 1>And I know how you perform and I know</v>

395
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 1>how you perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

396
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but I really get mad when they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care what's going on with the performer</v>

397
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

398
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle was at the store the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and some kid was yelling at him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just different questions at him.</v>

403
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just started going,</v>

404
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one guy yelled at and then it</v>

405
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 1>happened to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some other people in the room yelled</v>

406
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>at and it just got to this point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>

407
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 1>stop this.</v>

468
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:46.370
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know where to start to a</v>

<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and to influential.</v>

470
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do any of your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the years for sure.</v>

471
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Heard into Joe Rogan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were figuring it all out and</v>

474
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you became this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember coming over to Joe,</v>

475
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 1>he has a hit fucking Sitcom on the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd always see him at the comedy</v>

476
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come over tomorrow night and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

507
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really thought about it.</v>

508
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

509
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 1>You're waiting 15 years for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk to me about not having money to</v>

510
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:27.220
<v Speaker 1>pay your fucking rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a show.</v>

511
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

512
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe a club tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we caught an album,</v>

513
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe do a comedy central special after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

514
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>flushing the toilet after the first</v>

516
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:45.931
<v Speaker 1>season you have a career because now</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know you like fucking retarded,</v>

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Well already does a lot of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called me recently and he told me all</v>

519
00:22:57.371 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the shit he's stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 100% because of you.</v>

520
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I started doing the road 100% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember where we were.</v>

521
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>We were sticking to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

522
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to go back that far</v>

523
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.260
<v Speaker 1>cause you've done and come so far since</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

524
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 1>But it was like whenever I see a comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing well,</v>

525
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll always look to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

526
00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>this is what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're nuts if you don't do it.</v>

527
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it meant a lot to me because when I was</v>

528
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:18.520
<v Speaker 1>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way before I got into comedy,</v>

529
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I was fanny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours and I was listening to you with</v>

530
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>this girl that I was dating once we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

531
00:23:23.411 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 1>in the car and we were listening to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a cassette and a fucking house and we</v>

532
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:29.134
<v Speaker 1>were howling.</v>

533
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And this girl thought you were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest thing ever.</v>

534
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 1>And that was what made her cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she wasn't uptight because a lot of</v>

535
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>people back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the people that don't realize</v>

536
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your career's gone.</v>

537
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Like dice was unquestionably a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

538
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I give you the biggest comic ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

539
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 1>100% like when you were filling up</v>
<v Speaker 1>arenas,</v>

540
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>there was a different thing going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people could repeat your shit,</v>

541
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.230
<v Speaker 1>they could say what's in the bowl bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would see 15,000 people gone.</v>

542
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Watson batch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking crazy.</v>

543
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

544
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrates me when,</v>

545
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about the arenas with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>

546
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

547
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always bring up the garden,</v>

548
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 1>which was an honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:15.530
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most famous arena ever.</v>

550
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And I did the two nights there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

551
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 1>but I always tell these interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

552
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 1>do you understand?</v>

553
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I did over 300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

554
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the first tour alone was 26 cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 300 of these and they'd be gone in</v>

555
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 1>a matter of a couple hours before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

556
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>before twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before fucking followers I go old people</v>

<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>

565
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It was so into it starting again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll announce dates later on the show</v>

582
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:50.360

<v Speaker 1>real show.</v>

585
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And the way I perform now as is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very theatrical.</v>

586
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

587

<v Speaker 1>lot of ways you hate yourself and I</v>

<v Speaker 1>like you know when you're looking at a</v>

624
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 1>guy in the crowd who's sitting with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and he's with his best friend.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's your best friend.</v>

630
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Did your best friend ever call you one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time cause you got a hot looking wife.</v>

631
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 1>She's got them big kettle ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tits hanging down every holiday</v>

632
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 1>he gets to Haga little too close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

633
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.750
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time your best friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ever called you and said last night I</v>

634
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 1>jerked off thinking about your wife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy goes,</v>

635
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:19.801
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

636
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.634
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

637
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Because he's really not your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call you.</v>

638
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you last night I wheel</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel.</v>

639
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's walking on a hand picking up water</v>

640
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:34.010
<v Speaker 1>with a teeth for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know I go and then you bang her.</v>

641
00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>The way I tell you when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works out like my scenario,</v>

642
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the next scenario.</v>

643
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a guy hugging.</v>

644
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Your wife never turns around and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

645
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I love your wife's fucking edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way those pants split hop fucking</v>

646
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 1>crease between a legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think your wife is ugly</v>

647
00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 1>because your friend never takes the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you how many loads he drops just</v>

648
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 1>thinking about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't tell me he's your best friend.</v>

649
00:28:57.481 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He's your worst fucking enemy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

650
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm the friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all make sense and you get negative</v>

651
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:06.840
<v Speaker 1>feedback from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

652
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

653
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 1>because it's all done as a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

654
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>like the guys going with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that material?</v>

655
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:16.471
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

656
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 1>what should I go on stage and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been together with a woman 32</v>

657
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you love your family,</v>

658
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you raise beautiful children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to hear that.</v>

659
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 1>But here's the question.</v>

660
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Why does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it have to make sense?</v>

661
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it just be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my whole bike.</v>

662
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

663
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I've always said that like when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would ask me like,</v>

664
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 1>what's your favorite kind of comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

665
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I just want to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Joey is saying the most</v>

666
00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laugh than anything I've ever heard in</v>

667
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to make sense to me.</v>

668
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:45.440
<v Speaker 1>He's in a coma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all fine.</v>

669
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.070
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come?</v>

670
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 1>How come movies can be ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous in in what they're showing</v>

671
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:53.314
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

672
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially violent.</v>

673
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 1>When we think about how many violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies raw every fucking couple months.</v>

674
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy movie where a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get shot.</v>

675
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 1>It's constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

676
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.400
<v Speaker 1>But a guy on stage just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just absurd ways about sex.</v>

677
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Why is that pissing people off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even in comedies,</v>

678
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 1>and it really started around the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came,</v>

679
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 1>that came with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

680
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:16.990
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

681
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I sit with those glasses on tests.</v>

682
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

683
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started with the,</v>

684
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary movie that Matt Dillon did years</v>

685
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>ago was she's got a road trip come on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's hysterically laughing.</v>

686
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say it as a comic,</v>

687
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you say that?</v>

688
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Especially the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I do.</v>

689
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 1>But the way you're saying it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so over the top,</v>

690
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.270
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absurd.</v>

691
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people don't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's ridiculous.</v>

692
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Look at the last time I went to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>

693
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 1>it was me and Norton and Anthony Kumina</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Patrick Kelly and Bryan red band.</v>

694
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>You weren't there were you Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went to see you at the river.</v>

695
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking blast.</v>

696
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time just sitting there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an audience members watching and there's</v>

697
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the shit you talking about.</v>

698
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 1>It's so preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

699
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost makes me angry that anybody</v>

700
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 1>would have an argument with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like saying something wrong with what</v>

701
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you're saying because you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

702
00:31:16.861 --> 00:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It's so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were talking about someone how</v>

703
00:31:20.611 --> 00:31:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid could catch gay by the way.</v>

704
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You Bang your wife but also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also now I'm getting,</v>

705
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting questioned who's dice?</v>

<v Speaker 1>We share the same foot cause I wear to</v>

707

<v Speaker 1>fingerless gloves all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

708
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 1>we share the same fucking closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to tell you?</v>

709
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to separate the two for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

710
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Like men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go crazy from that.</v>

711
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they don't want to,</v>

712
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to allow that for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

713
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Like there's also to weird art forms the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day allow people to act differently and</v>

714
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become a character and then you're</v>

715
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 1>who you are off stage.</v>

716
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 1>But then in comedy for some reason they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to combine the two always and</v>

717
00:32:03.551 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like some guys are exactly who</v>

718
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like even now I'm self deprecated on</v>

719

<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about getting old or this and</v>

720
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was filling out all those arenas and</v>

770
00:34:57.021 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I take a lot of pride in that</v>

771
00:35:00.351 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 1>because I know I set a standard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics that today when I see,</v>

772
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Louis C k called me before he went</v>

776
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do anything other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they've come to love.</v>

777
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't exaggerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to just be you.</v>

778
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so many people,</v>

779
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I love is that,</v>

780
00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 1>that some of the guys have filled those</v>
<v Speaker 1>places now and I go,</v>

782
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mind that history now.</v>

783
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mind it back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realize the effect it would</v>

784
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 1>have on the future of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was very important,</v>

785
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 1>and it was overlooked by a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were,</v>

786
00:35:46.641 --> 00:35:48.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the talking about free speech all the</v>

787
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:48.921
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what,</v>

788
00:35:48.921 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 1>what happened with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was oh really overlooked because</v>

789
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that what you were doing was</v>

790
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>anything more crazy than anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the movies or anything that was</v>

791
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 1>in literature.</v>

792
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Anything that was in books or magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

793
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles,</v>

794
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 1>what you were doing was just a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme version of standup comedy.</v>

795
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I get done life.</v>

796
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 1>That's when life really fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people decided that your</v>

797
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 1>character promoted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:19.930
<v Speaker 1>in the most ridiculous ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted misogyny or a tray,</v>

799
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>get hatred against gays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't,</v>

800
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just funny fucking jokes.</v>

801
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how can,</v>

802
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and it was at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:31.760
<v Speaker 1>cause I remember when Ellen came out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closet,</v>

804
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I love that girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

805
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing against gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the time I was doing this act is</v>

806
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>when they were fighting for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

807
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:42.750
<v Speaker 1>when they want it to come at in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>closet,</v>

808
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was at,</v>

809
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

816
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago when I would do a joke about</v>

817
00:36:56.941 --> 00:36:57.601
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

818
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I would go and what's with these trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>testicles?</v>

819
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet the girly a dreams,</v>

822
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you're holding the tree trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not hate.</v>

823
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

824
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And now today everything's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when that happened with Caitlin</v>

825
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is doing a two hour interview about</v>

826
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:19.404
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

827
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it's all accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

828
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what anybody does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I couldn't believe that backlash</v>

830
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say nothing about hating anybody.</v>

831
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Even with the sexist remark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they call him a sexist,</v>

832
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not sexist.</v>

833
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happen to love women and I love having</v>

834
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 1>sex with women.</v>

835
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And I love making fun of how people make</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a big deal over sex.</v>

836
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all it's about.</v>

837
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So I like to paint these bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>life cartoon pictures,</v>

838
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people having sex that they laugh at</v>

839
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 1>themselves because we put so much on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 1>just so much on the act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

841
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.800
<v Speaker 1>of banging your chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the one moment in life when</v>

843
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 1>everything in the world that goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

844
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you guys just said,</v>

845
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I just lose myself in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

846
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:19.971
<v Speaker 1>when my balls a bashing into Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love for hours on end that my own wife</v>

847
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 1>has to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only a girl,</v>

848
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

849
00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just take,</v>

850
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

851
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.510
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the one moment in your life,</v>

852
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.220
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're blowing it out from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of your,</v>

853
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 1>not big for more the pressure you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone to that day.</v>

854
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You forget the world for those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatest feeling ever.</v>

855
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 1>If I could laugh hysterically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming at the same time,</v>

856
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I could die at that moment and I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to two greatest things ever to</v>

857
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>laugh as hard as you can from like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something a best buddy would tell you</v>

858
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that you can't control to kind of laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go.</v>

859
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe and you're blowing your</v>

860
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 1>load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could take death at that time.</v>

861
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 1>All good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to go.</v>

862
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you get the laugh gone?</v>

863
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Because we topics don't make you laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and calm at the same time.</v>

864
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to play a prank on her and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to fight off guilt to really</v>

865
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:27.360
<v Speaker 1>enjoy prank on your chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looks at you the same prank I do to</v>

866
00:39:27.361 --> 00:39:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you that you might laugh hysterical.</v>

867
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 1>She'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you say that?</v>

868
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

869
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.410

<v Speaker 1>so well adjusted,</v>

988
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.330

<v Speaker 1>they're rock stars on stage.</v>

990
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.550
<v Speaker 1>That's who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they're on stage,</v>

991
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 1>they're the most respectful,</v>

993
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 1>just as guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're both men now 21 and 25 and</v>

994
00:45:19.471 --> 00:45:22.110
<v Speaker 1>to hang with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a privilege to me because</v>

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but that's the beauty of them.</v>

1000
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 1>They know they could come to me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1001

<v Speaker 1>it's all sexual.</v>

1005
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.510

1043
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing tv shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're on that vinyl show too,</v>

1044
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:28.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all these legit acting gigs and</v>

1045
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 1>these legit acting gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking,</v>

1046
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 1>why would you go back to what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>best and what everybody loves you from?</v>

1047
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Because I never stopped doing how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about how crazy that is it</v>

1048
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 1>people who love you for this and Robin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Williams,</v>

1049
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 1>continuous standup career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Richard Pryor,</v>

1050
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 1>continuous standup Korea took a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off,</v>

1051
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but even Eddie Murphy did the stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>till till whatever happened to it.</v>

1052
00:47:51.311 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 1>But even when he started doing the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

1053
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:56.080
<v Speaker 1>he was still doing concert films as</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

1054
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with and doing your first</v>
<v Speaker 1>love?</v>

1055
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1056
00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with doing it when you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people want to see it.</v>

1057
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre that I load doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would decide that this is the movie</v>

1058
00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:10.150
<v Speaker 1>things more legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1059
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like what everybody's really going</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1060
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love acting.</v>

1062
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I've always loved acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I even got on stage as a</v>

1063
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:22.180
<v Speaker 1>comic because I didn't want to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting school once a week.</v>

1064
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I want it every day training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put together the act that you</v>

1065
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:31.111
<v Speaker 1>brought up earlier with Jerry Lewis into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travolta and I took that all the way up</v>

1066
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:36.361
<v Speaker 1>to doing Don Kirshner is rock concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after that I was thinking,</v>

1067
00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time a lot of directors would</v>

1068
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 1>come in to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

1069
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first movie I didn't get but I got</v>

1070
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 1>close to was the movie diner.</v>

1071
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Barry Levinson directed.</v>

1072
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And he saw me at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I was on stage being dicey.</v>

1073
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So this guy flies me to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts me in a school to learn the</v>

1074
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:07.651
<v Speaker 1>Boston accent with a teacher and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing with the pot and I obviously I</v>

1075
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 1>didn't get it in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why beyond at the comedy</v>

1076
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I just wanted to hone acting</v>

1077
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 1>chops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I finally did get,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1157
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what I did for New Year's Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that moment I knew I got to do</v>

1158
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first met you,</v>

1161
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 1>would you like to buy a flower for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady?</v>

1162
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:56.151
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>so I could plant it in your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crying,</v>

1164
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 1>not from funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crying because I had those</v>

1165
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the boys that was living in my</v>

1166
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 1>head when I walked around and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and people are like,</v>

1167
00:53:09.291 --> 00:53:10.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that lady's dress.</v>

1168
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a fucking dirty fucking content.</v>

1169
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the voice I had in my head.</v>

1170
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 1>So when I watched dice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

1171
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful poetic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1172
00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you have voice will have my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking idea the voices.</v>

1173
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I was living in boulder amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentiles,</v>

1174
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 1>which slippers that thought the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>was beautiful.</v>

1175
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in the back of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this inner voice that would always</v>

1176
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 1>look at people and judge and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking Jamoke fucking</v>

1177
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 1>birken socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet his wife,</v>

1178
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 1>his wife's a Vegan [inaudible] often a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy when it begins,</v>

1179
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the Ph just smells like a carrot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking grass.</v>

1180
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ph is off.</v>

1181
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>So I was sitting there and since I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say all of these dirty things in my</v>

1182
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first time I saw you at that</v>

<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>

1186
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:13.920
<v Speaker 1>This was who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To know that thing about coming to know</v>

1187
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:15.710

<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1188
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's more inmates like Joey,</v>

1189
00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:20.410

<v Speaker 1>them out common.</v>

1190
00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I met Joey and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a compliment to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1194
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You were at the front of the line for</v>

1196
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:38.150
<v Speaker 1>free speech for Comedians.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's this.</v>

1199
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:45.540
<v Speaker 1>No it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day it's a kind of art</v>

1200
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 1>and you might not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not asking you to go listen to</v>

1201
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 1>gangster rap either.</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody should be allowed to make them,</v>

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:00.083
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>the kind of people that he was seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old watching me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's like crazy shit.</v>

1227
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1228
00:55:58.311 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Bruno Mars a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like a not and these are</v>

1229
00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:04.880
<v Speaker 1>people I look up to that I loved that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1230
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.420
<v Speaker 1>You know how many seats is that place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The laugh factor in Vegas.</v>

1231
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's three 40 and now you know,</v>

1232
00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back there in April and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>in May that that putting me in the big</v>

1233
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.370
<v Speaker 1>showroom but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told Harry Bazell I said,</v>

1234
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go on the big show room for that</v>

1235
00:56:21.771 --> 00:56:22.604
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1236
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather work three nights for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same money in the small room that they</v>

1237
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 1>can get more money in the big room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go because I love being on top of the</v>

1238
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:34.630
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not out.</v>

1239
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were certain big things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that are not coming my way.</v>

1240
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:43.381
<v Speaker 1>There is talk about going into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden in September again because I sort</v>

1241
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>of owe that to myself and the fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1242
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:49.420
<v Speaker 1>because things have built to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>crescendo again.</v>

1243
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus my sons could be there and see</v>

1244
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 1>it all come down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's thrilling for me because my</v>

1245
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they're doing really well now</v>

1246
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 1>is because I teach them by example how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go after something.</v>

1247
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And about eight years ago when I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start gambling again just to pay my</v>

1248
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 1>mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1249
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I would tell my sons going to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling to pay your mortgage.</v>

1250
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I just wasn't making enough</v>

1251
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:19.120
<v Speaker 1>money and the gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:57:19.121 --> 00:57:24.121
<v Speaker 1>so I quit gambling for 10 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling a blackjack or you just really</v>

1253
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1254
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 1>well I had 30 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long Story Short,</v>

1255
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I turned it into 1,000,001 50 in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple days.</v>

1256
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I only play alone.</v>

1257
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 1>That's how I play blackjack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1258
00:57:38.171 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I was nice enough to give a lot of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1259
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>

1260
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what gambling is.</v>

1261
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.280
<v Speaker 1>But through these last few years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>building up again,</v>

1262
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

1263
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.550
<v Speaker 1>woody Allen didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1264
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I want you in my movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a couple million dollars.</v>

1265
00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1266
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 1>But it was an honor to do a movie for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1267
00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:02.761
<v Speaker 1>So I still had to do to gambling and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended the gambling with getting all the</v>

1268
00:58:04.601 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 1>money for them to record their album</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1269
00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still not ridiculous.</v>

1270
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying back taxes,</v>

1271
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking care of things that take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years to take care of.</v>

1272
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 1>But I also knew rock and roll was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>

1273
00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:19.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wood,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all these great rock bands are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1276
00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:32.851
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted my boys prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I gambled until I got every dime I</v>

1277
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:35.980
<v Speaker 1>needed for them to record.</v>

1278
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I would call dillon from Vegas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go book another week in the studio.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1287

<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1291
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.280

<v Speaker 1>how to make money.</v>

1307
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.910
<v Speaker 1>to like to try to make money by</v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling.</v>

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is when you sit down to,</v>

1309
00:59:46.261 --> 00:59:46.971
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

1310
00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I only play alone with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a dealer,</v>

1311
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 1>and you only play blackjack and only</v>
<v Speaker 1>black jazzes,</v>

1312
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you and the dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1313
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you put up in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to win.</v>

1314
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you gotta be willing to lose every</v>
<v Speaker 1>penny in front of you with no fear to</v>

1315
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:03.254
<v Speaker 1>beat them.</v>

1316
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the times I won and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times I'd walk outlet,</v>

1317
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>not winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1318
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing I recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1319
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>just like a performer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a certain feel for it,</v>

1320
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1321
01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I could walk into a casino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean years ago I'd play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>half a million at a clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1324
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that was years ago when I was doing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arena shows and that was just like a</v>

1325
01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>half million dollars a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could win or lose a half,</v>

1326
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>a million and a half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>that was a day I lost a half a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>by noon and by five in the afternoon,</v>

1328
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I want it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus another 55,000 oh my.</v>

1329
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>It was plays like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it was more about win 10 grand,</v>

1330
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>which to me is pretty simple to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>because I'm so used to playing gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures from years ago.</v>

1332
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So if I lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I sit down at a table with five grand</v>

1333
01:00:56.151 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'm down 2,500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sweat that because I</v>

1334
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>know I could get that back in 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

1335
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I would,</v>

1336
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you wouldn't 10 grand.</v>
