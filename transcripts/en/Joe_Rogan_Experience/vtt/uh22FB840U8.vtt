00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and so when you asked me do I infiltrate,</v>

3
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>do I?</v>

6
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Do I watch a steady diet of Fox News?</v>

7
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

8
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Do I read right when you decide to all the time?</v>

9
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

10
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Do I try to read stuff from all over the world from different points of view.</v>

11
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Why Greg?</v>

12
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Because it's interesting.</v>

13
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to agree with everything you read and I only say this to people</v>

14
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.014
<v Speaker 1>about comedy,</v>

15
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>the people that come and see you and don't like your politics and then get up in</v>

16
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.644
<v Speaker 1>a huff and fuck off.</v>

17
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I always think you're not sophisticated,</v>

18
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>not sophisticated and I don't mean that in like a smart Aleck.</v>

19
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.951
<v Speaker 1>You went to college way.</v>

20
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people who have no education,</v>

21
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>who can understand a whole bunch of ideas at once and see the humor of.</v>

22
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.233
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

23
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

24
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:39.441
<v Speaker 2>there's some people,</v>

25
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>there's lines you cannot cross.</v>

26
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Their pea brains won't allow it,</v>

27
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.321
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I mean.</v>

28
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Like come on to subject at top limits.</v>

29
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Mostly I find that if you are disagreeing,</v>

30
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember last year or two years ago when the election was going,</v>

31
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I did a joke in Eugene or Portland or no,</v>

32
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.781
<v Speaker 1>one of the places in Oregon,</v>

33
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.321
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't Eugene,</v>

34
00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>which is wicked liberal,</v>

35
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was a like Klamath.</v>

36
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the fuck it was in Oregon.</v>

38
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>There was a city in Oregon and uh,</v>

39
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I said something I said to the Republican nominees aren't just the worst group</v>

40
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>of nominees I've ever seen from the Republican Party in my lifetime.</v>

41
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>There the roots group of people I've ever seen in a room,</v>

42
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and started to go through them.</v>

44
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And one was Herman Cain and newcomer and someone in the back yelled,</v>

45
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

46
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.323
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

47
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.601
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

48
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to veto jokes and a guy,</v>

49
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

50
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>A Guy wrote me the other day on my email.</v>

51
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I take email from people and I read it.</v>

52
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't always answer,</v>

53
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>but any raw.</v>

54
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I was at your show in Chicago and it was a podcast.</v>

55
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So my pockets is not advertised as a standup show.</v>

56
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>It says podcast,</v>

57
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

59
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and therefore there's a different thing that's happening,</v>

60
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more real and you know,</v>

61
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

62
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote me,</v>

63
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:48.721
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

64
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

65
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't spend the 20 bucks or whatever to hear your fucking politics and I</v>

66
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>didn't think it was very funny and anyone that would like to show it would be a</v>

67
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.603
<v Speaker 1>halfwit and shit.</v>

68
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>So normally I would just block.</v>

69
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean now,</v>

70
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but I thought I'm going to run him back and I wrote,</v>

71
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you're hostile.</v>

72
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Tone is not conducive to discourse and understand this.</v>

73
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>You chose to come in the room and you pay it.</v>

74
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>If you'd ask for a refund of the time,</v>

75
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>that's another matter.</v>

76
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.511
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

77
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.201
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

78
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>after the show's over,</v>

79
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to email the artist and ask for your money back because you</v>

80
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>disagreed with them.</v>

81
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>You take your chances.</v>

82
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Whether you go to see a symphony or a movie or a fucking whatever it is you're</v>

83
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:25.221
<v Speaker 1>going to go see,</v>

84
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

85
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>when you go to Jack in the box,</v>

86
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you might not like them sausages,</v>

87
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to fucking write me after and tell me you want your money</v>

88
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

89
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And then say everyone that liked it was a moron when he was the only one who</v>

90
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.331
<v Speaker 1>didn't like it,</v>

91
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

93
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

94
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be people that can't wrap their head around the idea</v>

96
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that there's different people and different people like different stuff.</v>

97
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.610
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't like something it's okay.</v>

98
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 2>If there are other people enjoying it,</v>

99
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 2>well then you know that's for them and it's not for you.</v>

100
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 2>But the anger letter like I didn't,</v>

101
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't like your politics and fucking that wasn't very funny and the people are</v>

102
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>assholes and just sending that letter,</v>

103
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.564
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole.</v>

104
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.720
<v Speaker 2>He mean you might want to tell one of your friends like,</v>

105
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a good time.</v>

106
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>He's talking all this liberal shit.</v>

107
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.443
<v Speaker 2>Trayvon Martin.</v>

108
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

109
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>The night I,</v>

110
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I did it was the 50th anniversary of the march on Washington for jobs and</v>

111
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>freedom and I played a clip of Martin Luther King speech the part I have a dream</v>

112
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>

113
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.770
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't think the crowd had heard it before because a lot of young</v>

115
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>people haven't heard it exactly.</v>

116
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And everybody listen really intently and I thought this is what you objected to.</v>

117
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:38.011
<v Speaker 1>You objected to the biggest cry for peace in the last fucking 50 years.</v>

118
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.740
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

119
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 2>the idea of getting out of your own way.</v>

120
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.433
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

121
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.490
<v Speaker 2>How'd you figure that out?</v>

122
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean probably the same way you did.</v>

123
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:46.831
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

124
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the,</v>

125
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 3>it's anybody that's trying to do anything in art or filmmaking,</v>

126
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.931
<v Speaker 3>painting,</v>

127
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is you find or,</v>

128
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.030
<v Speaker 3>or sports or golf particularly.</v>

129
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.090
<v Speaker 3>You find that the tendency is to try too hard.</v>

130
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

131
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 3>You're so you want it so bad,</v>

132
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to screw up.</v>

133
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:08.220
<v Speaker 3>You want to get it right.</v>

134
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 3>You want to not embarrass yourself.</v>

135
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 3>And so you wind up trying,</v>

136
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:13.171
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>

137
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 3>trying so hard that nothing comes,</v>

138
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

139
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>

140
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>like over over time,</v>

141
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this is the same for everybody.</v>

142
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 3>You kind of say to yourself,</v>

143
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:21.721
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

144
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I just have to lighten up a little bit because when,</v>

145
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.520
<v Speaker 3>when good things happen is when I'm not trying so hard.</v>

146
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And in many ways I think that's the hardest thing of all.</v>

147
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously what you're saying about being in the jungle,</v>

148
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

149
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic juggle,</v>

150
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 3>what that's really all about is not trying.</v>

151
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.901
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

152
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like the hardest thing in the world is to say,</v>

153
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 3>somebody says to you,</v>

154
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.793
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>

155
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Or be yourself,</v>

157
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.431
<v Speaker 3>just be yourself,</v>

158
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

159
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

160
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

161
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

162
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and yet I think as we become more professional and better at what we're doing,</v>

163
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 3>when somebody says to you,</v>

164
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 3>be yourself,</v>

165
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.953
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

166
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

167
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

168
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 3>you're not burdened by these false selves and these things that,</v>

169
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

170
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 3>that you think you ought to be or ought to say,</v>

171
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 3>or how you want to look or what you ought to be.</v>

172
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.340
<v Speaker 3>You've kind of gotten rid of those,</v>

173
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

174
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.780
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>

175
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.041
<v Speaker 3>deliberately,</v>

176
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:12.000
<v Speaker 3>very deliberately.</v>

177
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 3>And I certainly have,</v>

178
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

180
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I've very deliberately tried,</v>

181
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Speaker 3>when I feel myself going that way to pull back and let go.</v>

183
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

184
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.580
<v Speaker 3>and I think in many ways that's what any artist does as they become a</v>

185
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 3>professional at what they do,</v>

186
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 3>they learned to kind of get out of their own way.</v>

187
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:30.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's the hardest thing of all,</v>

188
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:31.764
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

189
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 3>and the people we talk about resistance or the way people screw themselves up,</v>

190
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:36.954
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

191
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 3>That's how they screw themselves up is they're in,</v>

192
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.280
<v Speaker 3>they're getting in their own way,</v>

193
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

194
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 3>They're listening to their own bullshit,</v>

195
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 3>they're believing it and,</v>

196
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.861
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>

197
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 3>And they're blocked from whatever they're trying to do.</v>

198
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's what the comics right when they get on stage and they bomb,</v>

199
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:53.131
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

200
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:53.964
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>

201
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

202
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 2>That definitely is a big part of it.</v>

203
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.691
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

204
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

205
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the what,</v>

206
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

207
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 2>what I think you're doing that or think is really cool is that by living your</v>

208
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>life and figuring things out and then documenting and sharing them,</v>

209
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 2>sharing them like in a really honest way,</v>

210
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500
<v Speaker 2>we are all providing together what's basically a direction manual on how to live</v>

211
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 2>your life and avoid a lot of bullshit that most people get involved with.</v>

212
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>This is right.</v>

213
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>This is the stuff they don't teach you in school.</v>

214
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Exactly because they don't know we're trying to do now is the real problem is</v>

215
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>the human body and the human mind is probably the most complicated vehicle that</v>

216
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 2>the world has ever seen.</v>

217
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the rocket ships and all the different things that you have to</v>

218
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>go through years and years of school before they let you fuck with whether it's</v>

219
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 2>f 18 fighter jets or helicopters.</v>

220
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

221
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.180
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

222
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I watched a friend get his pilot's license.</v>

223
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Just studying all aerodynamics and all these different things.</v>

224
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 2>You have to know to take the test and winds and you don't have to do shit to be</v>

225
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.484
<v Speaker 2>a person.</v>

226
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 2>You're just a person.</v>

227
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

228
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>it's way crazier to operate this thing.</v>

229
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has emotions attached to it.</v>

230
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It can make other people with his penis,</v>

231
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 2>which it likes rubbing.</v>

232
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

233
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:11.471
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous animal and it's a ridiculous sort of a thing to try to manage</v>

234
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:15.720
<v Speaker 2>with no help and by you writing this book and people sharing their,</v>

235
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:17.680
<v Speaker 2>their own personal experiences and this.</v>

236
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that young men appreciate the most about old men is an old man</v>

237
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 2>who will tell you what he did wrong.</v>

238
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Like when I meet young kids and was like,</v>

239
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

240
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.973
<v Speaker 2>listen to me.</v>

241
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to bullshit you,</v>

242
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 2>but don't do that.</v>

243
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.183
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>

244
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>don't do this one because that one's stupid.</v>

245
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Of course nobody listens.</v>

246
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.583
<v Speaker 2>People do.</v>

247
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 2>But if there's an old expression that a wise man learns from the mistakes of</v>

248
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.134
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

249
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.793
<v Speaker 2>makes his own.</v>

250
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.331
<v Speaker 2>It was owed.</v>

251
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.164
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking human being.</v>
