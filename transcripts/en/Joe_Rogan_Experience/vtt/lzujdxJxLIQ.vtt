11
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.483
<v Speaker 2>week and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been hiding in a hotel for six </v>

19
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 2>the title?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a goof.</v>

20
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.613
<v Speaker 3>We haven't written a book in years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we really wanted to write </v>

21
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 3>a second book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.430

<v Speaker 3>pressure to write a second one,</v>

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 3>we Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>cooking.</v>

34
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.770

<v Speaker 3>subjects of which were into,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a joy.</v>

43
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.163

<v Speaker 3>we're building first they'd get in </v>

46
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 3>like north of Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about an hour and a half.</v>

47
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You can only get there by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by boat,</v>

48
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 3>a say kilometers from the landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 2000 watts of solar power.</v>

49
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Completely off grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even,</v>

50
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you can barely walk in because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jagged cliffs all around it.</v>

51
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:05.914
<v Speaker 3>And behind me is an old growth forest </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's protected federally and I have a </v>

52
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:14.161
<v Speaker 3>suture kit and salient my car always </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars outfitted,</v>

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 3>like he's got shovels on the roof and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>propane tanks on the roof.</v>

54
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago I drove to Alaska down </v>
<v Speaker 3>South Arizona,</v>

55
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 3>back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

56
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Twenty thousand miles.</v>

57
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.153
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Boston and I did stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Montreal for the first time I think </v>

58
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:30.504
<v Speaker 2>in like 1991 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking Boston was cold </v>

59
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>until I went to Montreal and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

60
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 2>this is a different things.</v>

61
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 3>We had the polar vortex last year come </v>
<v Speaker 3>roaring through.</v>

62
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.494
<v Speaker 3>I think all the pipes blue in all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants I'm sure like January </v>

63
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.164
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

64
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say is,</v>

65
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>do you think that living in such an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme environment in a beautiful city,</v>

66
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.220
<v Speaker 2>amazing city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an incredibly harsh environment</v>

67
00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>in the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that makes you more,</v>

68
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more cognizant?</v>

69
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 4>It's always the need for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always in the back of my head.</v>

70
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.934
<v Speaker 4>I have three daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I saw always in the back of my </v>

71
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:10.091
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And said,</v>

72
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 4>this is incredibly cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the power goes out for 48 hours,</v>

73
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I have to start a plan b.</v>
<v Speaker 4>where am I bringing my babies?</v>

74
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are we going to fit our city?</v>

75
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.654
<v Speaker 4>Over the last couple of years I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about a complete ban of </v>

76
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 4>fireplaces and wood burning stoves </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of homes,</v>

77
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:31.354
<v Speaker 4>condominiums and Hoe and houses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the laws governing wood burning and the </v>

78
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 4>city of Montreal are stricter than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones in California.</v>

79
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'd die.</v>

80
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we die,</v>

81
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is irresponsible,</v>

82
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the government to do this.</v>

83
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.131
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

84
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 4>make sure we don't use them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's all have them just in case.</v>

85
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 4>Same goes for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if a bit,</v>

86
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.293
<v Speaker 4>what are they worried about it for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're worried about their admission </v>

87
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 4>particulates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

88
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 4>correct man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it smells good.</v>

89
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Like a nice woodburnings doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this affects everybody.</v>

90
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 4>This affects restaurants and grilling </v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

91
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 4>This affects barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This effects or you know,</v>

92
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 4>a traditional bagels stores.</v>

96
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.753
<v Speaker 4>all the other ones you smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive part of our culture as </v>

97
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to understand that food wise,</v>

98
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 4>the province of Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the city of Quebec City and Montreal,</v>

99
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 4>she's a first place is populated in </v>
<v Speaker 4>North America.</v>

100
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.281
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

101
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 4>the Europeans to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to anywhere in North America.</v>

102
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 4>Came through Quebec First New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

103
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 4>The food culture in Quebec is over 400 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

104
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that about over a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

105
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

107
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 4>wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is detrimental to that if it wasn't</v>

108
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:52.414
<v Speaker 4>for burning wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying we should do it for </v>

109
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 4>historical purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like man,</v>

110
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 4>like if we run out of gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's still would give you a ticket,</v>

111

00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:22.774
<v Speaker 4>after that because people stayed home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no television and no heat and then </v>

120
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 4>procreated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there was a true baby boom.</v>

121
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Nine months later there was a ton of new</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids born.</v>

122
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the,</v>

123
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the deep freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also cleans the city in the winter,</v>

124
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.213
<v Speaker 4>so from your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit hits the fan and come and see </v>

125
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.534
<v Speaker 4>us because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty good city to survive </v>

126
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

127
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a pretty neat place because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>winter just sanitizes everything.</v>

128
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 4>You start again every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 4>As opposed to la where you never really </v>
<v Speaker 4>get that cleaned</v>

130
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll never have a long haul.</v>

131
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do like a horse bath,</v>

132
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.813
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just get it like a year in a </v>

133
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.013
<v Speaker 5>restroom somewhere with paper towels </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you went down and sort of get your </v>

134
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 5>underarms or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what La is,</v>

135
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.880
<v Speaker 5>the wet towel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's.</v>

136
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

137
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 5>So you just wanted to write a book that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of covers all of your interests,</v>

138
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:20.204
<v Speaker 5>not just with food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that I really </v>

139
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:23.084
<v Speaker 5>enjoyed about there was an episode that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys did have a Anthony Bourdain's </v>

140
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:31.381
<v Speaker 5>show where you were ice fishing and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>had one of those ice fishing huts</v>

141
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.213
<v Speaker 4>and you get into cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony told you it's notorious and they </v>

142
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:36.634
<v Speaker 4>show that they never caught fish and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever he had a gun he never hit </v>

143
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:41.284
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we knew that we knew that there was </v>

144
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:46.630
<v Speaker 4>not a pike and there was not a Walleye </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was going to bite.</v>

145
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 4>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

146
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.680
<v Speaker 4>option a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We sit there and take some fake fish and</v>

147
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 4>we fry it up in cornflakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in shortening.</v>

148
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:57.280
<v Speaker 4>And the hollow cabin where we just went </v>
<v Speaker 4>like joe beef crazy.</v>

149
00:06:57.281 --> 00:07:00.100
<v Speaker 4>And we brought all the old cookbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We add all the spirits,</v>

150
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:03.550
<v Speaker 4>like Cuban cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the copper where all this stuff.</v>

151
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 4>And we made the menu from an Old Leon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant,</v>

152
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Paul bocuse that he did a show at after </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in.</v>

153
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.970
<v Speaker 4>He knew nothing about that day and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>just went from fishing after he asked us</v>

154
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:17.971
<v Speaker 4>about like strippers and Quebec and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few funny banter and it was.</v>

155
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 4>We just went in and was like magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

156
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>It was seriously fence a 10th of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of this room here.</v>

157
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a tiny,</v>

158
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 4>tiny little shack and he tapped out that</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

159
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 5>He was having a good time and we hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

161
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 5>We brought some fine wines and fine </v>
<v Speaker 5>spirits from some really rare oddities.</v>

162
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.184
<v Speaker 5>Some old charts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rows and stuff like that that Fred had </v>

163
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:38.614
<v Speaker 5>lying around</v>

164
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Tony was,</v>

165
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 4>was fun as arts up on the screen right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

166
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.420
<v Speaker 4>He let it go a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

167
00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he calmed down and enjoyed us and let us</v>

168
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 4>do our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bit fatter.</v>

169
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.903
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

170
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 5>Those in the wine drinking days too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

171
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>correct.</v>

172
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

173
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.634
<v Speaker 5>that looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that Fagua in some sort of mashed </v>

174
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:00.814
<v Speaker 5>potatoes or something?</v>

175
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a wild rabbit.</v>

176
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a French recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gold hair a lot.</v>

177
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.143
<v Speaker 4>Were you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cook the hair for a long time and </v>

178
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 4>hair and you serve it with truffles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you take,</v>

179
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.773
<v Speaker 4>you keep the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This hair is snared so it's still full </v>

180
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:17.744
<v Speaker 4>of blood and you keep the blood and at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end you thicken the sauce with the </v>

181
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 4>blood flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

182
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 4>It's very good and I bet you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

183
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:23.894
<v Speaker 4>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you a fits all the principles of </v>

184
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 4>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you know it's like blood and all the</v>

185
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 4>organ meats and all the same with </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheese.</v>

186
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like the airport right there,</v>

187
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is interesting,</v>

188
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That no one</v>

189
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 5>thought of that until recently that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was what it was,</v>

190
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:40.354
<v Speaker 5>that people just thought of it as cheese</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now people think of it as there's </v>

191
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 5>live cultures on it and Oregon meat is </v>
<v Speaker 5>much healthier for you and people are so</v>

192
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:48.550
<v Speaker 5>much more.</v>

193
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.383
<v Speaker 4>Look at the cheese thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like nowadays a lot of the </v>

194
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>probiotic makers are doing like a light </v>
<v Speaker 4>bulb.</v>

195
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 6>Deliveries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They coded in fat so it resists the </v>

196
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.510
<v Speaker 6>stomach acid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

197
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 6>But that's fat probiotic from Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 6>covered in fat.</v>

198
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.313
<v Speaker 6>You did after your dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it lives through you and it all in a </v>

199
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 6>perfect world that comes from right </v>
<v Speaker 6>around your house.</v>

200
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.003
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you eat a cheese and the probiotics </v>

201
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 6>are the same one that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>encounter later.</v>

202
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 6>So you kind of get immunized in a way </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the benefit.</v>

203
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 6>That's what true local is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

204
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:21.834
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

205
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 6>Is there</v>

206
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 5>benefit to eating cheese after meal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

207
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 5>sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's a very pungent,</v>

208
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>advanced alive raw cheese,</v>

209
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 5>it'll be seen ultimately as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonalcoholic Dj Steve,</v>

210
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.000
<v Speaker 5>what does a Dj to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

211
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 5>to help stimulate digestion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh no kidding.</v>

212
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.600
<v Speaker 5>So it's almost like an enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

213
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 5>like a probiotic,</v>

214
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 6>but mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And now they're,</v>

215
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 6>they're figuring this out that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem of the low fat diet than the,</v>

216
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like brown rice and chicken breast,</v>

217
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bodybuilder diet.</v>

218
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.573
<v Speaker 6>Nothing triggers your fullness because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they realized that fat actually makes </v>

219
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 6>you full quite fast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

220
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 6>So if you eat a bit of cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're done.</v>

221
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.443
<v Speaker 6>You tap out after,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't need like a full plate of </v>

222
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:05.994
<v Speaker 6>cheese or layered on a hamburger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just a little bit of cheese after </v>

223
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 6>just cuts you off and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>spirits and cigars are not that healthy,</v>

224
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

225
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.573
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been talking about that with a lot </v>

226
00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:18.610
<v Speaker 5>of nutrition experts where they say that</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body,</v>

227
00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:19.444
<v Speaker 5>when it eats a lot of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can consume carbohydrates far past </v>

228
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:23.314
<v Speaker 5>what you actually need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you're just eating a lot of </v>

229
00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:25.864
<v Speaker 5>fat and protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body tends to regulate itself much </v>

230
00:10:27.821 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Satiate.</v>

231
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

232
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you guys,</v>

233
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 5>how long have you been in Montreal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I have to tell you,</v>

234
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:34.234
<v Speaker 5>and I've said it before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had a say my all time favorite </v>

235
00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:38.164
<v Speaker 5>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think joe beefs my all time favorite </v>

236
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:40.444
<v Speaker 5>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like to say my all time number </v>

237
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:43.960
<v Speaker 5>because there's a lot of great </v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurants in this world,</v>

238
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.730
<v Speaker 5>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had to choose one,</v>

239
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.610
<v Speaker 5>I think I might choose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys know you're very kind,</v>

240
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.070
<v Speaker 5>but we have to take you out to other </v>
<v Speaker 5>places to change your mind.</v>

241
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you've got a man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are the kind of,</v>

242
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.750
<v Speaker 5>if you're a horse lover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn your head,</v>

243
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.280
<v Speaker 5>plug your ears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys.</v>

244
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 5>The first people that ever served me </v>
<v Speaker 5>horse and I was like,</v>

245
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he brought over,</v>

246
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.350
<v Speaker 5>it was a horse horse tenderloin and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

247
00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:06.184
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys are eating horse up here and </v>

248
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.510
<v Speaker 5>horse tar tar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a stigma,</v>

249
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say a cow and Elica buys in a deer</v>

250
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.063
<v Speaker 5>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's four legged animal and you know </v>

251
00:11:16.331 --> 00:11:17.164
<v Speaker 5>what if I put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I put a buys in tenderloin and serve </v>

252
00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:24.250
<v Speaker 5>you a beef tenderloin and a cow </v>
<v Speaker 5>tenderloin and that deer tender lights,</v>

253
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

254
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:28.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just has a couple of degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 5>separation from the other.</v>

255
00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:29.860
<v Speaker 5>It's all flesh really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

256
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.753
<v Speaker 6>it's very subjective that we base or </v>
<v Speaker 6>nutritional choices and how pretty or </v>

257
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 6>how cute an animal is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

258
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:39.290
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

259
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.590
<v Speaker 6>and we're lucky now we're able to choose</v>
<v Speaker 6>where we eat.</v>

260
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like that a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

261
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:46.544
<v Speaker 6>the purpose of the food guide until like</v>
<v Speaker 6>40 years ago was to make sure you had </v>

262
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.340
<v Speaker 6>enough galleries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now we're in an age of restriction,</v>

263
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 6>so we like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't</v>

264
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
<v Speaker 4>want horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I prefer deer or I prefer veal or add </v>

265
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 4>chicken yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't have twice a neuro.</v>

266
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.853
<v Speaker 4>Like all this is a bit of fluff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we do in a way because we're so </v>

267
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 4>fortunate to have enough food to decide.</v>

268
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Remy Warren was on a backpacking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horseback elk hunt and one of the horses</v>

269
00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:14.790
<v Speaker 2>fell down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke its leg,</v>

270
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.863
<v Speaker 2>and they had to make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were deep in the back country and </v>

271
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:20.460
<v Speaker 2>they had to shoot it and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't gonna get out of there.</v>

272
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.383
<v Speaker 2>And after they shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he decided that really this sound was </v>

273
00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:27.414
<v Speaker 2>going to go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they took the back straps off and </v>

274
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.800
<v Speaker 2>they cooked it and ate it and they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really weird moment where like,</v>

275
00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:37.080
<v Speaker 2>this is the animal that was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's petting it.</v>

276
00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

277
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're riding it and it just,</v>

278
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.693
<v Speaker 2>it was a working animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was an animal that you loved and </v>

279
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.630
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden it's down and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to kill it.</v>

280
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.141
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

281
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 2>it's going to go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

282
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 2>it just felt wrong to let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to waste.</v>

283
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 2>So they cut the backstraps off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

284
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 4>other reason I think we don't eat horace</v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally is really based ultimately on</v>

285
00:12:56.831 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 4>the battle of Wolf between Mount Column </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the plains of Quebec City.</v>

286
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

287
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 4>that was a decisive battle in North </v>
<v Speaker 4>American history.</v>

288
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if the French had won that </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle,</v>

289
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 4>everybody in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately we'd be speaking French.</v>

290
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't win that battle.</v>

291
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.833
<v Speaker 4>So British rule imposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in England you did indeed horace by </v>

292
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:23.120
<v Speaker 4>royal decree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the franchise horace,</v>

293
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians had horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans eat horse,</v>

294
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.710
<v Speaker 4>you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what it is.</v>

295
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Very old history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

296
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.150
<v Speaker 4>it was mining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was potent and anglophone world.</v>

297
00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:34.260
<v Speaker 4>We'd Horace and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

298
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 4>and all the mining countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A half.</v>

299
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:37.804
<v Speaker 4>My family's from Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's traditional there because they </v>

300
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 4>bring the horse in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mine,</v>

301
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 4>the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

302
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 4>sad for a horse to live in the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the dark.</v>

303
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.740
<v Speaker 4>But they wouldn't bring it out when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was old,</v>

304
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would just eat the horse.</v>

305
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Most cultures eat Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat horse know.</v>

306
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a necessity.</v>

307
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.353
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't pick and choose back when </v>

308
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:57.604
<v Speaker 4>all this was instituted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're very limited in the proteins that </v>

309
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.350
<v Speaker 4>we eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And especially in North America,</v>

310
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Quebec last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

311
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Quebec has a very openminded dining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public,</v>

312
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 4>very advanced dining public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very old dining public,</v>

313
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 4>and of course Latin French dining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public.</v>

314
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.023
<v Speaker 4>The amount of proteins that are served </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a Montreal restaurant are numerous </v>

315
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 4>compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

316
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.064
<v Speaker 4>even when I go to Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if me and you and Fred are in Manhattan </v>

<v Speaker 4>let's go have rabbit with mustard sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a tough sell.</v>

319
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 4>We're going to really struggle to find </v>
<v Speaker 4>rabbit mustard sauce.</v>

320
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 4>We're going to struggle even to find a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Solid lab,</v>

323
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 4>NAC liver deer is a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tall order,</v>

324
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.514
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intimately Manhattan or America eats a </v>

325
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 4>limited scope of proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beef,</v>

<v Speaker 5>other restaurant people are eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of the registry and little girl.</v>

350
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.673
<v Speaker 5>Zealand and if they call it venison,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's most likely some sort of stag or </v>

351
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the elk that we get,</v>

352
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:51.840
<v Speaker 5>if we buy Elkanah restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all from New Zealand harvest.</v>

353
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you do a kill,</v>

354
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 5>you can put it in your freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

355
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:56.061
<v Speaker 5>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

356
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 5>we'll all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have two freezers back here.</v>

357
00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of,</v>

358
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elk that I get,</v>

359
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:02.444
<v Speaker 5>I get for myself that I hunt and I give </v>
<v Speaker 5>it to a lot of my friends and I make </v>

360
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.030
<v Speaker 5>sausages from my friends and I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

361
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.173
<v Speaker 5>but that's the only way they're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 5>get it unless they go out and get it </v>

362
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:11.144
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a place in Los Angeles where </v>

363
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:17.531
<v Speaker 5>you can go by elk meat and new in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Newfoundland that they're allowed to.</v>

364
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 5>Hunters are allowed to sell moose back </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the restaurants.</v>

365
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.561
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

366
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 5>Moose for introduced onto the island of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Newfoundland from Maine.</v>

367
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 5>And there was no natural predators on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Newfoundland.</v>

368
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 5>So the mood and it's a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment for them.</v>

369
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 5>So they just propagated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's why they take drive slow.</v>

370
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 5>They're we shot with Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they drove slow,</v>

371
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.013
<v Speaker 5>like we drove for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like full days to go like 300 miles </v>

372
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:43.274
<v Speaker 5>because you can't drive fast because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Moose is so you can have a </v>

373
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:48.610
<v Speaker 5>restaurant in the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We stayed,</v>

374
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.963
<v Speaker 5>the restaurant had a permit to buy Moose</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they would make like Moose curry and </v>

375
00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 5>moves us days in kind of vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not a great restaurant,</v>

376
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:57.674
<v Speaker 5>like a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hotel restaurant serving wild moose </v>

377
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 5>burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's pretty cool that they do that.</v>

378
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 5>That is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if they did that everywhere else,</v>

379
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:08.390
<v Speaker 5>then we're just reinventing the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

380
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 5>we're rolling.</v>

381
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.733
<v Speaker 5>We're going back to market hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what almost wiped out almost </v>

382
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:13.154
<v Speaker 5>all of the animals in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some shops in Quebec would like to </v>

383
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.600
<v Speaker 5>bring that back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

384
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said listen,</v>

385
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 5>we can barely manage our roads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our infrastructure,</v>

386
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:20.714
<v Speaker 5>we can barely manage like our.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the risk of foraging through </v>

387
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like eventually,</v>

388
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people go for mushrooms.</v>

389
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.624
<v Speaker 5>It's like you heard about the fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the mushroom pickers in Oregon </v>

390
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:30.540
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're no.</v>

391
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the people who harvest clams do it.</v>

392
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:34.744
<v Speaker 5>They'd like between the communities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's huge fights for territories and </v>

393
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:42.210
<v Speaker 5>they hijack like trucks of abalone at </v>
<v Speaker 5>night and gooey duck.</v>

394
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.050
<v Speaker 5>The giant King Clam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

395
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.923
<v Speaker 5>I've heard stories of a guide on an </v>
<v Speaker 5>economy line van with 500 pounds of </v>

396
00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 5>gooey duck going</v>

397
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 4>to the Victoria airport to send them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

398
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.693
<v Speaker 4>get hijacked on the highway at night and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they steal the clams because they're </v>

399
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 4>worth a fortune in Japan and same for </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushroom matsutake.</v>

400
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms are as well and other earth is</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous white.</v>

401
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's called a pine mushroom and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan to matsutake mushrooms.</v>

402
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 4>The closer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shape of the mushroom to a penis,</v>

403
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 4>the more expensive it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

404
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.350
<v Speaker 4>so they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually hijack people in their way</v>

405
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:15.184
<v Speaker 4>through the patch and like undressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and make them turn around so they </v>

406
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 4>can never find the place again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

407
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 4>This competitive Morel mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look a morel mushroom.</v>

408
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

409
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.033
<v Speaker 4>how much Fred for very expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 four bucks a kilo in Montreal and </v>

410
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.570
<v Speaker 4>pull this a little closer to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit.</v>

411
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Keep it brought up fist from your face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

412
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 4>the Morel Mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I buy them online.</v>

413
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.673
<v Speaker 4>They're very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I buy them dried and they're so </v>

414
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 4>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people who don't like mushrooms,</v>

415
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 4>like one of my daughters does not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>

416
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 4>but she loves morale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my favorite.</v>

417
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a number one mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good with salted,</v>

418
00:18:48.581 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 4>with garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>salt and sauteed in butter.</v>

419
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 4>They're sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great Mushroom,</v>

420
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.670
<v Speaker 4>strange flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of our favorite.</v>

421
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 4>There's a great recipe for that in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>book is poached chicken legs,</v>

422
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 4>right until they're ready and then into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the broth.</v>

423
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Very little broth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

424
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 4>you strain the broth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you add cream and salt.</v>

425
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 4>They Morel mushrooms in there and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit of Sherry wine.</v>

426
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.314
<v Speaker 4>Any of oxidized wine and you just add </v>
<v Speaker 4>the legs in there and you let you let </v>

427
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:14.071
<v Speaker 4>that simmer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

428
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:14.904
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a picture in the book of some </v>

429
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Morel Mushrooms are the size of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>water bottles.</v>

430
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 4>We've had morel mushrooms that are about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the size of my hand.</v>

431
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.660
<v Speaker 4>You can stuff like half a chicken leg </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of them and serve one stuff.</v>

432
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:28.380
<v Speaker 4>Morel mushroom and Bra for one customer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant.</v>

433
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 4>They're a strange mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

434
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Where they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They pop up after burns.</v>

435
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they also have spraying mushroom,</v>

436
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 4>which is weird because most of the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms or later on damp.</v>

437
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And morale is like literally quite quick</v>

438
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:44.934
<v Speaker 4>after the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first mushroom that appears </v>

439
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:47.304
<v Speaker 4>in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very different than all the </v>

440
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 4>others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they commercially cultivated?</v>

441
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.030
<v Speaker 4>They could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not.</v>

442
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My career tried growing mushrooms.</v>

443
00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:57.134
<v Speaker 4>We tried everything at the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried growing mushrooms and like you </v>

444
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 4>get everything but the mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you inoculate,</v>

445
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 4>it was very difficult to keep the proper</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions and stuff.</v>

446
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm not against the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're expensive,</v>

447
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:09.654
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good way to regulate a market </v>

448
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>price,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

449
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

450
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bluefin tuna is going extinct,</v>

451
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 4>but just make it three times the price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to regulate the market.</v>

452
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.373
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I wish there was a way to </v>

453
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce Bluefin to the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just seems like the appetite that </v>

454
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 4>people have for those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just untenable.</v>

455
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Give you a look at any given night in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>city like Manhattan,</v>

456
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.143
<v Speaker 4>how much red tuna is sold on the island </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Manhattan any given night of the </v>

457
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.660
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

458
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's scary.</v>

459
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:40.974
<v Speaker 4>I almost feel like it's like killing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last giraffe in a herd like fishing a </v>

460
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 4>giant tuna like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's and again,</v>

461
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 5>you know that they're big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're feisty.</v>

462
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 5>They're majestic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that should in guide my choice,</v>

463
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.130
<v Speaker 5>my decision and to protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like I said,</v>

464
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.463
<v Speaker 5>that's heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is the complete lack of </v>

465
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:02.374
<v Speaker 5>regulation on the open waters when these</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys have these enormous ships filled </v>

466
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:06.574
<v Speaker 5>with huge nance and just drag them </v>
<v Speaker 5>across the ocean floor and capture </v>

467
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.710
<v Speaker 5>everything that you catch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the biggest disconnect.</v>

468
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:17.750
<v Speaker 5>It's like they call it bycatch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you didn't set up the fish for tuna,</v>

469
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:19.880
<v Speaker 5>but that's what kind of bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

470
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.153
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

471
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

472
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:23.434
<v Speaker 5>you go fishing for what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To catch a Bluefin tuna in the first </v>

473
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:25.954
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

474
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

475
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:28.170
<v Speaker 5>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

476
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.390
<v Speaker 5>they're pretending they're not fishing </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>

477
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.110
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

478
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 5>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

479
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole thing was Japanese whalers.</v>

480
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.613
<v Speaker 5>They found a way to work around it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way the world's largest science </v>

481
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:38.944
<v Speaker 5>research posts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the science research where we're </v>

482
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:41.764
<v Speaker 5>going to do research on these whales </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we kill and then they chop them up </v>

483
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:44.494
<v Speaker 5>and sell them and sea shepherd has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>tracking that down and they hover over </v>

484
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 5>them and take photographs of it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>report them and now it's ugly business,</v>

485
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.883
<v Speaker 5>ugly business.</v>

486
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 5>We've worked hard at the restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 5>until I'm ultimately avoid it to be more</v>

487
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 5>seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sustainable seafood focused.</v>

488
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the oyster is a great thing to eat.</v>

489
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.060
<v Speaker 5>We should eat oysters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clams,</v>

490
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.973
<v Speaker 5>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oddly as an amazing sustainable seafood </v>

491
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 5>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

492
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 5>just the work that they do with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida stone crab,</v>

493
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:16.954
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that every year they just </v>

494
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 5>harvest like the left arm and they put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put the crap back and the next year</v>

495
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 5>it's the right arm and they put the crab</v>
<v Speaker 5>back real.</v>

496
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a brilliant fishing industry.</v>

497
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.683
<v Speaker 5>They don't kill the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the clog rows back and it's a side </v>

498
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.613
<v Speaker 5>side-by-side sound like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're telling me something good about </v>

499
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a great shrimping,</v>

500
00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:40.294
<v Speaker 5>seen a great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're actually leaders in </v>

501
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:42.964
<v Speaker 5>sustainable seafood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seafood and fishing is such a gigantic </v>

502
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 5>part of their economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense that they would do that.</v>

503
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 5>That's a smart thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grouper fishing down there is a giant,</v>

504
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 5>giant part of there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a good book that was published a</v>

505
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.191
<v Speaker 5>few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big oyster,</v>

506
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:00.220
<v Speaker 5>I think mark Galinsky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wrote a book about the history of the</v>

507
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:01.054
<v Speaker 5>oyster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the New York and the history of the </v>

508
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 5>oyster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

509
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 5>Super interesting because this is his </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing was like,</v>

510
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we try to portray or history as glorious</v>

511
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:10.354
<v Speaker 5>and we heard it bisons before for </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein and that's how we started like </v>

512
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.793
<v Speaker 5>modern farming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in fact we probably farmed oysters </v>

513
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:18.214
<v Speaker 5>and snails and clients because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't move and they are the most </v>

514
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.983
<v Speaker 5>prolific and the most abundant source of</v>
<v Speaker 5>protein in that book are landscape </v>

515
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.743
<v Speaker 5>brings up a premise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm loosely interpreting it now </v>

516
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 5>because I read this book a few years </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

517
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 5>but think of this for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

518
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 5>The island of Manhattan a is a perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the rivers around it,</v>

519
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.323
<v Speaker 5>all the water systems around it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually one of the greater oyster </v>

520
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 5>situations</v>

521
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.540
<v Speaker 3>on the Atlantic east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

522
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.643
<v Speaker 3>The reason that the population exploded </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Manhattan in the early days was that </v>

523
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 3>any person could literally get off a </v>
<v Speaker 3>boat,</v>

524
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.390
<v Speaker 3>walk onto the island of Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless,</v>

525
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.630
<v Speaker 3>broke and sleeping an alley and walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to the river and pick five oysters.</v>

526
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 3>A small oyster is five grams of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

527
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 3>A medium oysters got 10 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>

528
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 3>so completely destitute person could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just eat six oysters a day,</v>

529
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three oysters and live again another day</v>

530
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Speaker 3>to find a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the population ultimately,</v>

531
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York City and its population was </v>

532
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 3>based on this readily supply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge supply of oysters.</v>

533
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.013
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

534
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.203
<v Speaker 3>That's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Available source of protein that will </v>

535
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.134
<v Speaker 3>make you live another 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it takes you three days to find a </v>

536
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 3>job for days to find a job at 20 days to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find a job,</v>

537
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to die because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>oysters.</v>

538
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Look at this and yeah,</v>

539
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.083
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

540
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.440
<v Speaker 2>they found from the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this from Harlem River Oysters.</v>

541
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

542
00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.313
<v Speaker 2>There's a actual islands that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought were like Geo geological </v>

543
00:25:02.471 --> 00:25:04.690
<v Speaker 2>formation that are made of oyster </v>
<v Speaker 2>shells.</v>

544
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.793
<v Speaker 2>This layers and layers of oyster shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The article that Jamie put up is from </v>

545
00:25:08.651 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>thrillist is I would pull up to the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can tell people the order,</v>

546
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.453
<v Speaker 2>the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why oysters are ridiculously important </v>

547
00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:20.080
<v Speaker 2>to the history of New York City and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just showing all these ancient photos of</v>

548
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 2>mounds of oyster shells and is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing program today.</v>

549
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the areas that there's.</v>

550
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.680
<v Speaker 2>That they take these giant cages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Oyster,</v>

551
00:25:29.681 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>if I'm correct,</v>

552
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:36.090
<v Speaker 3>oyster filters for metric tons of water </v>
<v Speaker 3>per day.</v>

553
00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 3>From what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong with my math,</v>

554
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.200
<v Speaker 3>so take this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

555
00:25:41.201 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you know a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cage box of thousands of oysters.</v>

556
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.803
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

557
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Single Oyster can filter about 30 to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water every day.</v>

558
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.123
<v Speaker 2>Little loose math job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital New York's waterways on exactly </v>

559
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:57.374
<v Speaker 2>the cleanest the folks behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion oyster project or trying to </v>

560
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 2>change that by recycling shells from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

561
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 2>partnering restaurants and getting them </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the water to build oyster reefs.</v>

562
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>The goal is to add a billion oysters to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water by 20,</v>

563
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 2>35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far they're restored.</v>

564
00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:12.800
<v Speaker 2>One point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

565
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.620
<v Speaker 2>one acre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One point five acres of reason.</v>

566
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say one point.</v>

567
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five bid sheet.</v>

568
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 2>You got an acre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

569
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>that's you just add in those extra two </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>

570
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.951
<v Speaker 2>One point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

571
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 2>five acres of reefs and count 11 point 5</v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

572
00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Newly grown oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the oysters will clarify the water.</v>

573
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 2>It'll make a murky river clear again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

574
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 2>But it didn't affect the taste of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oyster.</v>

575
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.663
<v Speaker 2>They don't eat those oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are pulled back into </v>

576
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 2>landfill after or mulched into gardens </v>
<v Speaker 2>or for.</v>

577
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 2>The shells are banned from where reef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the oyster is interesting.</v>

578
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

579
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 5>It opens its shells to the feed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing how they do it.</v>

580
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 5>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the oyster,</v>

581
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.574
<v Speaker 5>you know that the oyster has a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will change gender according to the </v>

582
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 5>density of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it'll go from male to female in order</v>

583
00:26:57.691 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 5>to balance the center.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

584
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 5>We're watching a video where the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

585
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 5>The oyster recovery was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the timeline.</v>

586
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.043
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

587
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 5>So it's a timelapse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it said what,</v>

588
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 5>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was from a filtration.</v>

589
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:11.004
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there was a watermark on the video </v>

590
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 5>there on the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was showing receipts.</v>

591
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oyster recovery partnership.</v>

592
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.693
<v Speaker 5>So the watermark is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what they do is they have this </v>

593
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 5>horrible green water chuck these oysters</v>
<v Speaker 5>in and it turns it completely clear.</v>

594
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not know that.</v>

595
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.703
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that they used to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>lobsters and they thought of lobster </v>

596
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:36.141
<v Speaker 5>says poor people food out of the river </v>
<v Speaker 5>in New Brunswick.</v>

597
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 5>They used to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

598
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.473
<v Speaker 5>harvests lobsters to feed to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>prisoners and keep the shells as </v>

599
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:43.824
<v Speaker 5>fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Jefferson was one of the first </v>

600
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:46.224
<v Speaker 5>presidents to bring the lobster into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>White House because it was seen as </v>

601
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 5>servants food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When did it switch Jefferson?</v>

602
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.093
<v Speaker 5>So when he started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when people realized it was so </v>

603
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:57.500
<v Speaker 5>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lobster socially will be,</v>

604
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.930
<v Speaker 5>if we changed the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lobsters could get a job is insane.</v>

605
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 5>That lobster spaghetti that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's off the charts,</v>

606
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.703
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the child labor laws were in stored </v>

607
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 5>primarily because of the kids that used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to work in an oyster.</v>

608
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 5>Shucking plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

609
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.363
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

610
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 5>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of our best friend,</v>

611
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 5>if not our best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>passed away like six months ago.</v>

612
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.764
<v Speaker 5>John Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a great chucker you helped us at </v>

613
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 5>the Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like deep into sustainability and</v>

614
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:25.374
<v Speaker 5>history of oysters and everything and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like the source for oysters for </v>

615
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

616
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a beautiful book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will send you a copy.</v>

617
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:32.694
<v Speaker 5>It's an incredible book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are good food for vegans to </v>

618
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 5>consider too because there are more </v>
<v Speaker 5>primitive than most plants.</v>

619
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know.</v>

620
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.203
<v Speaker 5>Smallest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John used to call them ocean cupcakes </v>

621
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 5>are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great source of protein,</v>

622
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:47.780
<v Speaker 5>but it's also they don't have any nerve </v>
<v Speaker 5>endings.</v>

623
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 5>They're not feeling any sea vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

624
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 5>It basically is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have an issue or some people,</v>

625
00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:54.294
<v Speaker 5>not myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some people have an issue with </v>

626
00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:58.140
<v Speaker 5>things that are capable of moving for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever reason,</v>

627
00:28:58.141 --> 00:28:58.974
<v Speaker 5>we just decided that don't eat that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to talk about something </v>

628
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:02.364
<v Speaker 5>sustainable like mollusks and seafood </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mean they can be commercially </v>

629
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:06.511
<v Speaker 5>farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

630
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.344
<v Speaker 5>they actually do have a positive impact </v>
<v Speaker 5>as you're describing on the environment </v>

631
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:13.490
<v Speaker 5>and credible source of protein as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

632
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.493
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and really owned her complete source of </v>

633
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 5>protein.</v>

634
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 5>Not like a very bioavailable source,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unlike a lot of vegetable proteins.</v>

635
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.190
<v Speaker 5>So maybe we should do a protein powder </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of dried oysters.</v>

636
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.320
<v Speaker 5>Just moisture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protein bro.</v>

637
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean a lot of people are eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>cricket protein.</v>

638
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:36.620
<v Speaker 5>If you guys ever serve any insect dishes</v>
<v Speaker 5>really well.</v>

639
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.463
<v Speaker 5>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a letter last week that someone </v>

640
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:44.031
<v Speaker 5>found bug in their salad in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know sometimes the people are a bit.</v>

641
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.043
<v Speaker 5>They want the cake and they went to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>it too because they people want organic </v>

642
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 5>and we support that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We love that,</v>

643
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>organic.</v>

644
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 5>There's no pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's okay.</v>

645
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:58.853
<v Speaker 5>The bugs aren't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the idea of bugs being like </v>

646
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 5>roaches are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

647
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Most other bugs are not that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

648
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 5>It's like quite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

649
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 5>if we're serving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're serving 100 people a day and maybe</v>

650
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 5>that arguably being 40 solid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

651
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 5>some kind of crazy work to really look </v>
<v Speaker 5>at both sides of each leaf.</v>

652
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.920
<v Speaker 5>We try our best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

653
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one at one will get past us every year.</v>

654
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 5>I think you're better off the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

655
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 5>that are freaking out about bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want them coming in there.</v>

656
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Just let them just give them their money</v>
<v Speaker 5>back and get the fuck out of here.</v>

657
00:30:28.121 --> 00:30:30.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that policy.</v>

658
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.390
<v Speaker 5>But when I was in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they uh,</v>

659
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.430
<v Speaker 5>we checked into this resort and they had</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bowl of fried crickets in the hotel.</v>

660
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Like they had some sort of a flavor to </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

661
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:43.550
<v Speaker 5>They added some flavor to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

662
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.413
<v Speaker 5>Rene Redzepi and noma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arguably one of the world's best </v>

663
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 5>restaurants is obsessed with serving </v>
<v Speaker 5>ads.</v>

664
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 5>Really loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lemony fresh.</v>

665
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.191
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

666
00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 5>I think they're crunchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're delicious.</v>

667
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

668
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.520
<v Speaker 5>he thinks they're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

669
00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.403
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's doing this wonderful nordic </v>

670
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:01.864
<v Speaker 5>cuisine and there's ants and vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they foraged mushrooms and there's </v>

671
00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:08.930
<v Speaker 5>also ad.</v>

672
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:13.120
<v Speaker 5>So why not forge those two and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>homework they do for the rest of us,</v>

673
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it starts there,</v>

674
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 5>they're doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

675
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 5>people pay a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flight there to go eat there,</v>

676
00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:18.484
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing some good legwork and how to </v>

677
00:31:21.071 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 5>prepare them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to raise them,</v>

678
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.404
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

679
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying it's food is based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

680
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.170
<v Speaker 5>but I'm happy that somebody did that </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the research and he'll bring the</v>

681
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 5>point up and that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

682
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:35.281
<v Speaker 5>ultimately by Osmosis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other younger chefs will try to do that.</v>

683
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 5>I know will tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll normalize it a little bit more.</v>

684
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 5>So expect aunt at Nordic restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

685
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:43.690
<v Speaker 5>So this is the new trend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get ahead.</v>

686
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Los Angeles.</v>

687
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 5>I know you trendy fox are out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about what's coming.</v>

688
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm crickets or a weird one.</v>

689
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 5>Like cricket seemed to be like </v>
<v Speaker 5>universally accepted.</v>

690
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 5>Like cricket protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protein bars.</v>

691
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 5>You don't see too many other insects </v>
<v Speaker 5>being like commercially harvested.</v>

692
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.510
<v Speaker 5>David and I were in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

693
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.593
<v Speaker 5>for Anthony's a memory thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>memorial thing and we walked in the </v>

694
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 5>bowery and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the afternoon,</v>

695
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:11.651

<v Speaker 5>clams and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in the bin and it's full of giant bull </v>
<v Speaker 5>frogs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>five live in their little lies.</v>

704
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:36.760
<v Speaker 5>Just looking up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

705
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 5>sure we have frogs in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was.</v>

706
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 5>So hang on,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

708
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years arguably if not more,</v>

709
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I've probably assessed were processed or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a French cookie.</v>

710
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of course we can.</v>

711
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 3>We just look at the frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't say anything to each other.</v>

712
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 3>We keep on walking and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on a sec,</v>

713
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 3>fred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk me through.</v>

714
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 3>This goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how exactly does this work?</v>

715
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do a hair.</v>

716
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do any fish.</v>

717
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Any seafood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lobster.</v>

718
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Case of frog in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your first move right now?</v>

719
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 3>What's their first move?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we take the live frog.</v>

720
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.054
<v Speaker 3>Do I put it on the cutting board?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I hack its legs off and what do I do </v>

721
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 3>with the 60 percent remaining of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog?</v>

722
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

723
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>is it ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it end up in dumplings?</v>

724
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Where's that other part of the frog </v>
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>

725
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Is it soup?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it broth?</v>

726
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Know that's an amphibian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fascinating.</v>

727
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Did you experiment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

728
00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.493
<v Speaker 3>I'm mortified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after that we went to Tony's </v>

729
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:38.084
<v Speaker 3>memorial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a Chinese restaurant and I was </v>

730
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:40.814
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't eat because by default </v>

731
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>everything had like frog in it in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

732
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.450
<v Speaker 3>So you were freaking out just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were alive staring up at you know,</v>

733
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 3>because I know that the legs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

734
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

735
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.923
<v Speaker 3>if I chop the legs off and I peel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin and I dredge them in flour and I </v>

736
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:59.420
<v Speaker 3>fry them and I served them with garlic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cream,</v>

737
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 3>that they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's delicious chicken wings.</v>

738
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:07.330
<v Speaker 3>What I'm worried about is the frog is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>big and you know,</v>

739
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 3>the discarded part of the frog is a size</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a softball.</v>

740
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

741
00:34:12.881 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like eating the stem of the apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>and leaving the apple in cooking.</v>

742
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 3>We don't throw stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

743
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.493
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to know what happens to that </v>

744
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 3>part in Chinese cookery or French </v>
<v Speaker 3>cookery?</v>

745
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

746
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.760
<v Speaker 5>the place that you guys were at was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese market.</v>

747
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was one of those hole in the door,</v>

748
00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 5>kind of like supplier and it was like we</v>
<v Speaker 5>got it.</v>

749
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 5>There were claims that were wink Perry </v>
<v Speaker 5>winkles.</v>

750
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 5>There were like all like Google never </v>
<v Speaker 5>processed trogs in my career.</v>

751
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:46.251
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

752
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.084
<v Speaker 5>when I've gotten fresh frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was working in France and it was just </v>

753
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 5>the frog's legs and a button in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>basket.</v>

754
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.060
<v Speaker 5>But even then I would wonder in France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where does that other part go?</v>

755
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.233
<v Speaker 5>I know this is a very disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what seems like there's got to be an </v>

756
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 5>answer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

757
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be the people that I would call</v>

758
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.890
<v Speaker 5>one ton stuffing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

759
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Sort of boiled and I'm hoping they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>discarded.</v>

760
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.650
<v Speaker 5>I just googled it and the video is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>graphic.</v>

761
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.470
<v Speaker 5>Let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let it roll.</v>

762
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.180
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to put it up on Youtube.</v>

763
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.023
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll put it up.</v>

764
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Put it up for us so we can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

765
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

766
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 5>They don't even bother killing them </v>
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

767
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:30.490
<v Speaker 5>They just do it on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the legs off off.</v>

768
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly how I pursue ease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

769
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 5>So they squeeze it out once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut the head off the.</v>

770
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 5>They squeeze it out like A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you describe that?</v>

771
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 5>Like they're appealing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

772
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.513
<v Speaker 5>So then they squeezed the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they squeezed the innards out through </v>

773
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 5>the neck cavity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last of toothpaste.</v>

774
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to describe it.</v>

775
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

776
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:52.944
<v Speaker 5>So then they take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it looks like a man because it's </v>

777
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.060
<v Speaker 5>headless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a headless man that's.</v>

778
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of those you use to draw </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies there?</v>

779
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

780
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.183
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would point you put the batteries to </v>

781
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:07.224
<v Speaker 5>the hind legs.</v>

782
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 5>Batteries know in like high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

783
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:12.530
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put the little battery in the back.</v>

784
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 5>Light cigarettes in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's chopping them up.</v>

785
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 5>It seems like he's leaving the bones on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what he's doing?</v>

786
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:21.751
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

787
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:22.584
<v Speaker 5>So you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really great that we're watching </v>

788
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:26.610
<v Speaker 5>this because I'm a lot less horrified by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole prospect of it.</v>

789
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.680
<v Speaker 5>So he's just hacking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bones intact and then.</v>

790
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.573
<v Speaker 5>And chucking it into a basket so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't look like they're missing much </v>

791
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.693
<v Speaker 5>other than the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it seems like the energy and then </v>

792
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:40.100
<v Speaker 5>they seem to be boiling all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>and okay.</v>

793
00:36:40.101 --> 00:36:40.934
<v Speaker 5>So they put it in a soup with the bones </v>
<v Speaker 5>and tact and you just sort of </v>

794
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.510
<v Speaker 5>highlighted that it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

795
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.563
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I had to make a dish with data and </v>

796
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:49.710
<v Speaker 5>make the super daily lives inside the </v>
<v Speaker 5>water lilies,</v>

797
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean with lily pad soup with frog.</v>

798
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.293
<v Speaker 5>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever tried anything with no </v>

799
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.110
<v Speaker 5>leaves?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look like lily pads,</v>

800
00:36:58.111 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are hot right now and cooking.</v>

801
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:00.803
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys try to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like add some of the ingredients of the </v>

802
00:37:03.301 --> 00:37:06.660
<v Speaker 5>native environments of the tricks to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooking?</v>

803
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:07.703
<v Speaker 5>What are the best tricks or cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you chef told me this a long time </v>

804
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 5>ago in France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

805
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:12.390
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chef,</v>

806
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 5>what should I cook with a lamb with?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes cheesy.</v>

807
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.433
<v Speaker 5>What would it eat if you had a land?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be growing around it and it </v>

808
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.700
<v Speaker 5>automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just scroll down.</v>

809
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 5>If I had a lamb and a p,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an acre of land,</v>

810
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 5>what would be around it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There would be turnips,</v>

811
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 5>there would be carrots and onions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There will be apples,</v>

812
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 5>there'll be pairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there will be time,</v>

813
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 5>there will be basil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there would be garlic,</v>

814
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 5>there would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just.</v>

815
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.220
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Traditional idealic environment.</v>

816
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:36.054
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is when you have lobster </v>

817
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:39.300
<v Speaker 5>and you cook it with mangoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

818
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 5>We're lobster is where law comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no mangoes,</v>

819
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 5>so the recipe doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might be delicious,</v>

820
00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 5>but it's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But butter,</v>

821
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 5>lobster and butter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go together.</v>

822
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 5>Lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>butter,</v>

823
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 5>potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else grows their onions?</v>

824
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 5>A Prince Edward Island.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

825
00:37:56.311 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 5>Small island in the Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the provinces of Canada.</v>

826
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 5>We have cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'd say those and lobster.</v>

827
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Three resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not the.</v>

828
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 5>Not the actual environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A rabbit.</v>

829
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 5>If you have a rabbit in your backyard or</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

830
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.830
<v Speaker 5>in the line of sight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

831
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.980
<v Speaker 5>I get what can you see there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

832
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 5>rabbit with apples and carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes Sense.</v>

833
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.320
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

834
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what if lobster and mango is fucking</v>

835
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:22.290
<v Speaker 5>delicious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

836
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:22.940
<v Speaker 5>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

837
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for other people to do,</v>

838
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 5>we have our principals academically </v>
<v Speaker 5>incorrect.</v>

839
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.903
<v Speaker 5>Incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>

840
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite pizzas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get disgusted at me.</v>

841
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.090
<v Speaker 5>Don't hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pineapple and Ancho.</v>

842
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.150
<v Speaker 5>Pineapple and anchovy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

843
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 5>Pineapple and ham and pineapple and </v>
<v Speaker 5>anchovy.</v>

844
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 5>It's God damn delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking love it.</v>

845
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who does that though?</v>

846
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 5>You'd invented that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might have.</v>

847
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.660
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I want to try it.</v>

848
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:48.523
<v Speaker 5>I want to try frog soup with lily pads </v>
<v Speaker 5>and pineapple and anchovy pizza with </v>

849
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:53.764
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part with the pineapple and hard with </v>

850
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 5>the anchovy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to write a book?</v>

851
00:38:56.951 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Three with us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Joe.</v>

852
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm good at elk steaks and I know how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>order pineapple and anchovy pizza.</v>

853
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:05.283
<v Speaker 5>I have to say that when they see your </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture you posted if you're a meat </v>

854
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 5>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Bad.</v>

855
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 5>It's always on point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>

856
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:12.483
<v Speaker 5>Because there's a lot of hunters that </v>
<v Speaker 5>post up pictures of their dinner and </v>

857
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 5>it's not because like you can take </v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures and they'll look beautiful with</v>

858
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 5>like a vanity thing.</v>

859
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 5>It's not the quality of the picture but </v>
<v Speaker 5>the food is a little bit.</v>

860
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some hunters don't know how to cook.</v>

861
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 5>We have a lot of hunters in Quebec and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you know the hunter will bring</v>

862
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:32.134
<v Speaker 5>by the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I shot this beautiful Mousse </v>

863
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.253
<v Speaker 5>David at wayside 2000 pounds or 1500 </v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds and he shows me a picture on his </v>

864
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:43.921
<v Speaker 5>phone and then he brings me a jar of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>spaghetti sauce he made out of the Moose</v>

865
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.233
<v Speaker 5>after like really like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shot them majestic Moose and the </v>

866
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 5>forest and you made spaghetti sauce with</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

867
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Like put Kiwi and then because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>tenderizes the meat.</v>

868
00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.403
<v Speaker 5>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spaghetti sauce with ground moves is </v>

869
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 5>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you a tip.</v>

870
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 5>You gotta have you gotta have a high eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

871
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 5>I eat the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

872
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

873
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.013
<v Speaker 5>I know how to make the roasts and I use </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground for a bunch of different </v>

874
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:19.261
<v Speaker 5>things and I just think that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do it properly or if you,</v>

875
00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:20.994
<v Speaker 5>if you want to handle it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've really got to read up on how to </v>

876
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 5>cook wild game as opposed to how to cook</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything else.</v>

877
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 5>There's a very little fat content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a tricky kind of meat to cook.</v>

878
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.900
<v Speaker 5>There's a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called a lapdog in French.</v>

879
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:35.734
<v Speaker 5>It's like a big needle with a swivel tip</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what you do is you cut long strips </v>

880
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:42.260
<v Speaker 5>of fat and you poke him through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>

881
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 5>abject it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet you don't inject,</v>

882
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 5>you put like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like writing it,</v>

883
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.060
<v Speaker 5>threading your piece of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the loins are the fat,</v>

884
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 5>the back straps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

885
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 5>it tends to be leaner.</v>

886
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.393
<v Speaker 5>So you put long strips of pork fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside and you cook it slowly enough </v>

887
00:40:57.821 --> 00:40:58.654
<v Speaker 5>that the pork fat will melt inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in every bite you'll have a little </v>

888
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:04.900
<v Speaker 5>bit of fat to neat saying it's an old </v>
<v Speaker 5>French cooking treg yeah,</v>

889
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:05.743
<v Speaker 5>that sounds sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or what we do actually for the wild </v>

890
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 5>rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is extremely dry,</v>

891
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.543
<v Speaker 5>we'll put a veal foot with the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that'll give up the Collagen and </v>

892
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 5>we'll put the slice of pork belly with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

893
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.033
<v Speaker 5>They'll give up the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When are you guys going back to </v>

894
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 5>Montreal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tomorrow.</v>

895
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.320
<v Speaker 5>Tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

896
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I can't give you meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

897
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:28.481
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

898
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 5>it couldn't get through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The border.</v>

899
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't work this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other way works.</v>

900
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it works if you</v>

901
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.890
<v Speaker 4>hunted and bringing it through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought.</v>

902
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 4>I brought me back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a damn.</v>

903
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to give you guys something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what you do with it.</v>

904
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's our favorite meat,</v>

905
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be sooner.</v>

906
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Be caught with bricks of hashish then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Venison as restaurant owners,</v>

907
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:53.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

908
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd been.</v>

909
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 4>You cannot have any wild game in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>

910
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's just for your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>consumption,</v>

911
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:06.881
<v Speaker 4>not really started yet into two is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem and never in Quebec if caviar,</v>

912
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a lot of sturgeon in the Gulf of</v>

913
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 4>St Lawrence that laws are written like </v>
<v Speaker 4>lights out,</v>

914
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:11.864
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get caught with like a gram of </v>

915
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 4>caviar and your boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a license,</v>

916
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 4>so freeze your bank accounts and sees </v>
<v Speaker 4>your house kind of thing and we'd go and</v>

917
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 4>we'd go south quick.</v>

918
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.263
<v Speaker 4>What is the concern?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it such a commercial market for </v>

919
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.990
<v Speaker 4>sturgeon caviar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

920
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

921
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:28.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

922
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 4>So people will just go that far out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their way to get caviar that they had to</v>

923
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.133
<v Speaker 4>just make these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a fish right now is worthless </v>

924
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 4>if you can't use the caviar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

925
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 4>We're allowed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fishery for them.</v>

926
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.190
<v Speaker 4>They fished sturgeon in the Gulf of St </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence.</v>

927
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 4>When they catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to gut them.</v>

928
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:45.824
<v Speaker 4>They have to remove every egg and dump </v>
<v Speaker 4>the eggs into the water that they're </v>

929
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 4>allowed to bring the meat back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to smoke it and salt it and to sell it.</v>

930
00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:57.761
<v Speaker 4>There is a commercial commercial wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>fishery for a sturgeon meat,</v>

931
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:58.723
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ultimately you just put a price tag </v>

932
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 4>on the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it's worth 200 bucks,</v>

933
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 4>but all of a sudden if you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>harvest the eggs and the fish,</v>

934
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.363
<v Speaker 4>15 grand.</v>

935
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.373
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would just be,</v>

936
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:09.763
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they produce a more monolithic </v>

937
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:11.804
<v Speaker 4>amount of eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy is now you're making it </v>

938
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 4>useless because you're throwing it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that's incredibly valuable and</v>

939
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 4>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The quotas are very small though.</v>

940
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:19.694
<v Speaker 4>Let's say if you had a sturgeon license,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine you're allowed five or six or </v>

941
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:24.480
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

942
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.500
<v Speaker 4>the first nations like Mohawks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the heroes have the right to fish.</v>

943
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:31.004
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been on boats where a guy was </v>

944
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:33.201
<v Speaker 4>fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

945
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 4>he showed us the traditional technique </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not the sports fishing like the</v>

946
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 4>soup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

947
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.833
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like,</v>

948
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 4>they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great fish in themselves.</v>

949
00:43:41.841 --> 00:43:42.674
<v Speaker 4>They the eggs and make soup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put the eggs in it they like or </v>

950
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 4>they catch sergeant 20 minutes from Joe </v>
<v Speaker 4>Beef right there downtown.</v>

951
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would up with a spear.</v>

952
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy animal.</v>

953
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.700
<v Speaker 4>And when you see them in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

954
00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you see the scales on them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So bizarre that I mean,</v>

955
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.270
<v Speaker 4>how they're from what 100 million years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago to start.</v>

956
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Once they look like dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really do.</v>

957
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.773
<v Speaker 4>And the guys that we know that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system is quite the character is an </v>

958
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 4>interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

959
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.873
<v Speaker 4>he's a Mohawk and he told us that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologist but underwater cameras there </v>

960
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:15.763
<v Speaker 4>to look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep track of the fish and they said </v>

961
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 4>they see like 16 layers of sturgeon </v>
<v Speaker 4>swimming,</v>

962
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 4>one at the top of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said I could walk on the fish.</v>

963
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that many.</v>

964
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton.</v>

965
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

966
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.641
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

967
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:29.474
<v Speaker 4>the people don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We even struggled with it at the </v>

968
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.733
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me to sell a plate of smoked </v>

969
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 4>sturgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough sell,</v>

970
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sooner sell other things than that.</v>

971
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't interested.</v>

972
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a tough sell as a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say as a,</v>

973
00:44:45.441 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 4>as a 200 gram or four ounce piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish thing.</v>

974
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the same river?</v>

975
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.970
<v Speaker 4>That's probably Columbia river sturgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks like frasier.</v>

976
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fraser,</v>

977
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 4>NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at the size of that thing.</v>

978
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 4>That is so ancient looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it shouldn't be here.</v>

979
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fish that's a bit muddy.</v>

980
00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Do sometimes depending on where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught and everything.</v>

981
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:10.910
<v Speaker 4>So how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

982
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.813
<v Speaker 4>how do you handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were going to cook one of </v>

983
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:14.830
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we make Jamaican patties.</v>

984
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did an old French cookery.</v>

985
00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways to cook sturgeon is,</v>

986
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately you apply cooking a piece of </v>

987
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:27.300
<v Speaker 4>sturgeon loin as you would a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>veal loin of pork loin.</v>

988
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 4>A meat juice even is acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 4>roasted carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roasted onions,</v>

990
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:37.131
<v Speaker 4>roasted to salary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roast the storage in and bake bacon,</v>

991
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 4>mushroom red wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Fred said.</v>

992
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.103
<v Speaker 4>So you treat the sturgeon as you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet is possibly the best way to treat </v>

993
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 4>it as you would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fish is not the best.</v>

994
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.353
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people got to expect we were overly </v>

995
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:53.350
<v Speaker 4>fortunate to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

996
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 4>300 gram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

997
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:59.580
<v Speaker 4>like a pound of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seared in a pan and served with a little</v>

998
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 4>sauce was common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

999
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:06.690
<v Speaker 4>But it's not the right thing to do if we</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to keep things in the water,</v>

1000
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for kids or whatever.</v>

1001
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 4>So people got used to this like a piece </v>
<v Speaker 4>of fish that they like,</v>

1002
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.810
<v Speaker 4>nothing that you can eat for like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour and a half because you have so much</v>

1003
00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 4>of it then that's the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at fish lake sturgeon is great.</v>

1004
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.910
<v Speaker 4>If you have a little bit then the sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like David Mate says,</v>

1005
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.033
<v Speaker 4>talks about over like a buttery mashed </v>
<v Speaker 4>potatoes or like with like an egg </v>

1006
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 4>noodles or something like that.</v>

1007
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.933
<v Speaker 4>It's a great way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's a great way to look at fish </v>

1008
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need actually 75 grams of protein,</v>

1009
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:37.950
<v Speaker 4>not like 500.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the,</v>

1010
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 4>is there a comparison that you can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of what it tastes like?</v>

1011
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm [inaudible] a little bit,</v>

1012
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.780
<v Speaker 4>I guess somewhat braised a braised veal </v>
<v Speaker 4>color.</v>

1013
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you say?</v>

1014
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Blanquette?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd do a larger piece of stew,</v>

1015
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.733
<v Speaker 4>like not a small two inch block of Stew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's say a bigger piece of stew </v>

1016
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.630
<v Speaker 4>with a chunk of seaweed in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1017
00:47:01.631 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's neat.</v>

1018
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 4>It's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds now I'm hungry for it.</v>

1019
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.920
<v Speaker 4>We do like a fred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fred got the,</v>

1020
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 4>made the God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big nuggets.</v>

1021
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:10.951
<v Speaker 4>Molds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1022
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:11.784
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mcnuggets have this like not there </v>

1023
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 4>was like four or five different sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fred made the mold and the first book I,</v>

1024
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.713
<v Speaker 4>they precisely exactly like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald's mcnuggets and we used to do </v>

1025
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 4>sturgeon mcnuggets or eel eel mcnuggets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same fishery,</v>

1026
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have deals where we get sturgeon.</v>

1027
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.293
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1028
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of a ton of them at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

1029
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 3>It would literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be a job for and you'd get on your</v>

1030
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:35.914
<v Speaker 3>plate what looked to be like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcnuggets with the sauce and the Little </v>

1031
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Paper Cup on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like,</v>

1032
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.020
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I says,</v>

1033
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Sergeant Nuggets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People is a weird one.</v>

1034
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 3>When I used to go fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people would catch eels,</v>

1035
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:50.420
<v Speaker 3>they'd be upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1036
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.550
<v Speaker 3>and then I would go to buy Sushi later </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in life and uh,</v>

1037
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 3>there'd be eel Sushi and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on different?</v>

1038
00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:01.080
<v Speaker 3>A Wolf Wolf Eel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different fence.</v>

1039
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a true isla in Sushi.</v>

1040
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

1041
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even like the real deal,</v>

1042
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can eat bits of it,</v>

1043
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.323
<v Speaker 3>but if we were to take a kneel eel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dislike first you have to put a nail in </v>

1044
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:14.554
<v Speaker 3>his head and the nail and it's Dale and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like skin it and cut its head off and </v>

1045
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.880
<v Speaker 3>peel it and put it in a cast iron pan </v>
<v Speaker 3>with butter.</v>

1046
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's still moving like a snake and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the smell of it,</v>

1047
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 3>it makes you choke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1048
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.523
<v Speaker 3>we had like four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a little truck pond at Joe beef </v>

1049
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 3>that I built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1050
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.590
<v Speaker 3>really that and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad experience because we had a</v>

1051
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 3>refrigerator thing that makes the water </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

1052
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cooler.</v>

1053
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 3>And we had a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time it rained,</v>

1054
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 3>it would turn the breaker off and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish like drowned,</v>

1055
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 3>drowned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no oxygen.</v>

1056
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.863
<v Speaker 3>Martin Picard gave us some meals and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>found him the next day in the parking </v>

1057
00:48:52.781 --> 00:48:53.614
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the way on the other side of </v>

1058
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 3>the parking lot and the baseball field </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the bleachers when shit,</v>

1059
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 3>they're cooking it and it's swimming at </v>
<v Speaker 3>a head and no skin at this point.</v>

1060
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 3>This is a grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>

1061
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It say shocking clip of cooking and eel </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive in Seoul.</v>

1062
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That els beheaded and skinned beheaded.</v>

1063
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Still nervous system is still very </v>
<v Speaker 3>intact.</v>

1064
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those things?</v>

1065
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 3>In the bottom there was this legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is.</v>

1066
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 3>That's probably its guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

1067
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1068
00:49:25.051 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real.</v>

1069
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Stir frying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught one whites in Nova Scotia and a</v>

1070
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:33.740
<v Speaker 3>hook and line and when I caught it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fisherman next to me,</v>

1071
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1072
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 3>don't reel it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just held my fishing rod.</v>

1073
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.523
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't reading in and the eel real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That itself up my line to the tip of my </v>

1074
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 3>fishing rod and started reading down my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing rod towards me.</v>

1075
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was horrified.</v>

1076
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:50.524
<v Speaker 3>Ever since then I've had an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I worked in a restaurant in France </v>

1077
00:49:55.710 --> 00:50:00.710
<v Speaker 3>and diesel and in the fridge right near </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cook of the hotline,</v>

1078
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:01.564
<v Speaker 3>the cooking line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a wooden box with a </v>

1079
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 3>cinderblock on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the first day at work there.</v>

1080
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I was helping out on the fish station </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hear in French [inaudible] on come</v>

1081
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 3>on the Webinar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you all ordered up?</v>

1082
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1083
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish chef says go in the fridge,</v>

1084
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a wooden box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take the cinder block off it,</v>

1085
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>you just lift the lid a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plunger hand in there,</v>

1086
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 3>grabbing eel and bring it back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1087
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.943
<v Speaker 3>kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1088
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 4>So I literally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go into the walk in fridge.</v>

1089
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I pulled a wooden box out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take the cinder block off the top,</v>

1090
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I lift the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just literally,</v>

1091
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 eels rising together and it's like </v>

1092
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Indiana Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1093
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 4>they live with an out of water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

1094
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Martin Picard at Peter Shaw in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant right now.</v>

1095
00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:51.534
<v Speaker 4>What was there last week?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a lobster tank right in the </v>

1096
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 4>doorway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they hang your coats right above</v>

1097
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:02.540
<v Speaker 4>it and in it there's like eight massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>eels.</v>

1098
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:03.403
<v Speaker 4>Then chase them when they come at work </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning they reopened the </v>

1099
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:07.100
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll find them like in the cash,</v>

1100
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:07.934
<v Speaker 4>register it in the coat check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have like cinderblocks down now on </v>

1101
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 4>the top they got a plexi glass top with </v>
<v Speaker 4>holes in it,</v>

1102
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 4>so it oxygenates and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally pinned down in that tank.</v>

1103
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 4>But even as you're eating and you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>see those giant eels in the tank or size</v>

1104
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 4>of your flag here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just horrific.</v>

1105
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.704
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the best thing about eels talking </v>

1106
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:29.834
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1107
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the flavor?</v>

1108
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super smoked,</v>

1109
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:40.580
<v Speaker 4>super salted down with a good sugary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>salty brine.</v>

1110
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 4>You have to cover it like in nuggets </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we did,</v>

1111
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:44.984
<v Speaker 4>but like even like laying dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant David was talking about if </v>

1112
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 4>you take a fresh piece of veal and put </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a cast iron pan to smoke,</v>

1113
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like mustard gas.</v>

1114
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1115
00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:54.771
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1116
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's super.</v>

1117
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.313
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit allergic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess not all fish but some fish and </v>

1118
00:52:00.761 --> 00:52:02.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I used to work at that restaurant,</v>

1119
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:03.463
<v Speaker 4>we would literally like put a knife </v>
<v Speaker 4>through his head and into the cutting </v>

1120
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:10.250
<v Speaker 4>board and then another knife through its</v>
<v Speaker 4>tail so it would be straight on the,</v>

1121
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.143
<v Speaker 4>on the cutting boards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We pinned down the left side on the </v>

1122
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 4>right side of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we'd lift the filets skin them,</v>

1123
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:17.683
<v Speaker 4>score them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then Pan sear them with artichoke </v>

1124
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:21.980
<v Speaker 4>and country ham.</v>

1125
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.830
<v Speaker 4>And as I was pants hearing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was breathing in the vapors of searing</v>

1126
00:52:27.831 --> 00:52:30.350
<v Speaker 4>the eel and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my lungs would seize,</v>

1127
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:33.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have like kind of like,</v>

1128
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.310
<v Speaker 4>it would give me an asthma attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat.</v>

1129
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.153
<v Speaker 4>It was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's just a popular dish in France </v>

1130
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Speaker 4>because of necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of a lack of,</v>

1131
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.193
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of old French cooking would be </v>

1132
00:52:45.201 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 4>based on what you had in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>

1133
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1134
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.070
<v Speaker 4>French cooking was very different pre </v>
<v Speaker 4>federal express,</v>

1135
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 4>pre roads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1136
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:59.681
<v Speaker 4>so eels in French cooking would come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the Bordeaux region ultimately,</v>

1137
00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be like a donkey,</v>

1138
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 4>so it would be an eel stu in red wine of</v>
<v Speaker 4>course,</v>

1139
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:07.281
<v Speaker 4>carrot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>onion,</v>

1140
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:09.110
<v Speaker 4>celery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly like a beef stew.</v>

1141
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.513
<v Speaker 4>And I think also the thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a dish that you wouldn't make </v>

1142
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 4>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1143
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.630
<v Speaker 4>so people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lay on d,</v>

1144
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Let's go need to heal because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what there was.</v>

1145
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to have the cinderblock </v>
<v Speaker 4>plexiglass case in your house.</v>

1146
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:26.310
<v Speaker 4>And then the imagine your house with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1147
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.080
<v Speaker 4>your kids are my kids land praise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's Bordeaux,</v>

1148
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1149
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 4>some of the famous iconic dishes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bordeaux is lamb praise.</v>

1150
00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 4>This is like an animal from Dune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1151
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.143
<v Speaker 4>it's like a big hole with teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the ones that cling to the </v>

1152
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:42.090
<v Speaker 4>bottom of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct,</v>

1153
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a remora.</v>

1154

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1155
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 4>The land prey is a problem actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1156
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:46.854
<v Speaker 4>even in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're coming up in some rivers and </v>

1157
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 4>they attached themselves to fish with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their suction cup head.</v>

1158
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.140
<v Speaker 4>They're just horrific animal suction cup</v>
<v Speaker 4>head too.</v>

1159
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 4>If it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What do they taste like?</v>

1162
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Probably the crappy like eel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a dinner Shittier Isla.</v>

1163
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.953
<v Speaker 4>We did a dinner for Tony when he did his</v>
<v Speaker 4>second book I think at Liverpool House </v>

1164
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:14.250
<v Speaker 4>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were much younger and I was like,</v>

1165
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.360
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's buy some like daring food,</v>

1166
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:17.223

<v Speaker 4>Tony Board endless by something like </v>

1167
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

1168
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.240
<v Speaker 4>So I ordered like two of those eel and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to make soup.</v>

1169
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Widowhood had tried to make everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1170
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the classic Joe,</v>

1171
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 4>the best thing to do it is to put it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the garbage.</v>

1172
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 4>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make stock,</v>

1173
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 4>you reduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nutro it away.</v>

1174
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's a recipe that's good </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure in,</v>

1175
00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.373
<v Speaker 4>in case of apocalypse after the winter </v>
<v Speaker 4>succeeds will fish for that and we'll </v>

1176
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 4>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But until then,</v>

1177
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:45.953
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1178
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with like cutting my big MACs </v>
<v Speaker 4>in half,</v>

1179
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:49.704
<v Speaker 4>so they last for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a cool company that I've been </v>

1180
00:54:51.481 --> 00:54:54.110
<v Speaker 4>following a company online I think on </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

1181
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 4>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called American who Nagi.</v>

1182
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:57.953
<v Speaker 4>They're up in the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>northeast area I think in Maine or </v>

1183
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts somewhere or they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>some really.</v>

1184
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.673
<v Speaker 4>They're raising eels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think releasing them into the nature </v>

1185
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:07.914
<v Speaker 4>and they're selling eels commercially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They looks again like horrific work </v>

1186
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.230
<v Speaker 4>raising them and releasing them in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>field.</v>

1187
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:16.003
<v Speaker 4>Who is there like some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental benefit of having the </v>

1188
00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:19.824
<v Speaker 4>eels?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it staying about the lobster and put </v>

1189
00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 4>it away in a freshwater river?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are weird animal.</v>

1190
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:25.591
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1191
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 4>loosely based.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My facts are old reading,</v>

1192
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 4>but from what I recall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eels are cool because they all the eels</v>

1193
00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:40.280
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to the Sargasso Sea.</v>

1194
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Is it true that that's what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that folklore,</v>

1195
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 4>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Filtration,</v>

1196
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:50.050
<v Speaker 4>volume?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1197
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1198
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Oysters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>filter emails.</v>

1199
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 4>So they all go back to this one area </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1200
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly there's a breeding area for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them called the Sargasso Sea.</v>

1201
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:01.943
<v Speaker 4>Great place for swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And where's the Sargasso sea is kind of </v>

1202
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 4>a southern Middle Atlantic from what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>recall.</v>

1203
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.320
<v Speaker 4>So that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty safe,</v>

1204
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the where the where.</v>

1205
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.300
<v Speaker 4>The mythical plastic patches.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

1208
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen really a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real true picture of the Sargasso Sea.</v>

1209
00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 4>The eels in our last date in their way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>who is a young fellow that figured out a</v>

1215
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 2>way to filter out the garbage patch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has been.</v>

1216
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 2>He developed this device and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently started implementing it,</v>

1217
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.900
<v Speaker 2>but he's been uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been on the podcast before and when</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're in Maine.</v>

1223
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:07.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Our aquaculture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

1225

<v Speaker 4>Oysters there too.</v>

1226
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:16.470
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you guys ever cooked or eaten?</v>

1227
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Blueberry bear.</v>

1228
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.230
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't Mark Marta in Montreal.</v>

1229
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.513
<v Speaker 4>Martinez even embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's hunting berry goes and baits every </v>

1230
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:29.300
<v Speaker 4>weekend and then he goes in shacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's a blueberry bear though?</v>

1231
00:57:29.301 --> 00:57:32.120
<v Speaker 4>My friend Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's described this to</v>

1232
00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:33.883
<v Speaker 2>apparently when bears eat blueberries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they find like it's towards the </v>

1233
00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:40.610
<v Speaker 2>fall in particular when the trend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatten up before they go into the den,</v>

1234
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.830
<v Speaker 2>they'll find these massive fields of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blueberries.</v>

1235
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:43.933
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shot one in Alaska and this bear had </v>

1236
00:57:46.791 --> 00:57:47.624
<v Speaker 2>eaten so many blueberries and when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened it up it smelled like </v>

1237
00:57:49.671 --> 00:57:50.504
<v Speaker 2>blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1238
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:55.850
<v Speaker 2>the actual fat had a purple hue to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's supposed to be as spectacularly</v>

1239
00:57:55.941 --> 00:57:57.950
<v Speaker 2>delicious meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally makes sense.</v>

1240
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.063
<v Speaker 6>But you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's funny you say that because I was </v>

1241
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:01.394
<v Speaker 6>thinking about that with Venice and </v>
<v Speaker 6>before we have some friends who had a </v>

1242
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.400
<v Speaker 6>venison from and what would they visit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1243
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:07.913
<v Speaker 2>This is steve cooking it on the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows called mediator will actually a </v>

1244
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.550
<v Speaker 2>guest on the show here Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1245
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but see how the fat tissue to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he said it's,</v>

1246
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:18.383
<v Speaker 2>it all smells like blueberry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he rendered down the bear fat and </v>

1247
00:58:22.741 --> 00:58:27.000
<v Speaker 2>then because this was all in the field </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then cook the bear meat is blueberry</v>

1248
00:58:27.001 --> 00:58:29.100
<v Speaker 2>bear meat chunks of it in the fat.</v>

1249
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.680
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if the pigment is a lipid soluble,</v>

1250
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.470
<v Speaker 6>then it would make sense that you find </v>
<v Speaker 6>it in the fat.</v>

1251
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:37.440
<v Speaker 6>But they made a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they made experiments,</v>

1252
00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:39.510
<v Speaker 6>are friends with the deer farm and what </v>
<v Speaker 6>they did,</v>

1253
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.793
<v Speaker 6>they wanted to know if the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the taste of venison was owed to the </v>

1254
00:58:44.311 --> 00:58:45.144
<v Speaker 6>fact that the diet of the animal or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way that hunters traditionally break </v>

1255
00:58:49.731 --> 00:58:53.130
<v Speaker 6>down the meat in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the field dressing of the meat,</v>

1256
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:56.520
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what they did is they put up a beef,</v>

1257
00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 6>like a steer and they shot him and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they prepared them,</v>

1258
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.124
<v Speaker 6>they dressed him the way you would a </v>
<v Speaker 6>deer or a moose and then they at the </v>

1259
00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:08.370
<v Speaker 6>same time did the same thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>deer.</v>

1260
00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:09.204
<v Speaker 6>And then they did the slaughterhouse </v>
<v Speaker 6>treatment like a commercial treatment </v>

1261
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.900
<v Speaker 6>for both animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they realize that once you,</v>

1262
00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:17.370
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your weight a little bit,</v>

1263
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:18.263
<v Speaker 6>even on the beef before you got it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>before you skin it and everything that </v>

1264
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:28.270
<v Speaker 6>funky or that Gamey taste will come even</v>
<v Speaker 6>to beef no fracture.</v>

1265
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:30.543
<v Speaker 6>That's why yeast in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably also they think that you </v>

1266
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 6>might like the skills to properly </v>
<v Speaker 6>extract the guts.</v>

1267
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:41.530
<v Speaker 6>You might perforate the guts sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might perforate the,</v>

1268
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.273
<v Speaker 6>the bile a pouch there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Parts of the innards might come in </v>

1269
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 6>contact with the skin will be onto long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not bled properly as well.</v>

1270
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:53.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not blend properly.</v>

1271
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1272
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 6>it's not chilled super rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Make you kill in the morning.</v>

1273
00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 6>The whole sun is out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1274
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 6>you don't have a fridge with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have no water.</v>

1275
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 6>And.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But on the other hand,</v>

1276
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.930
<v Speaker 6>when we have the wild rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they taste like juniper,</v>

1277
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 6>like very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

1278
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.170
<v Speaker 6>very strongly like juniper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

1279
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.270
<v Speaker 6>that's in fact the challenge is to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>rid of some of that juniper taste.</v>

1280
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:19.243
<v Speaker 6>It's like the partridge that we shoot at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lake and in fact it's spruce spruce </v>

1281
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:24.344
<v Speaker 6>tips and instead of when we cook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes we'll cook meat and then </v>

1282
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:28.064
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll even add a partridge or at home </v>

1283
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:31.694
<v Speaker 6>I'll have the partridge or a wild rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 6>just as seasoning to the rest of the </v>

1284
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 6>pot.</v>

1285
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.033
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you look at all the traditional </v>

1286
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.973
<v Speaker 6>French Canadian dishes of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all like all the games that are </v>

1287
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.710
<v Speaker 6>mixed up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1288
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.720
<v Speaker 6>so you never have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a modern queasy ne like culinary</v>

1289
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:55.361
<v Speaker 6>fancy thing to have a breast of </v>
<v Speaker 6>partridge seared on a bed of cabbage.</v>

1290
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those things are always treated with,</v>

1291
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.850
<v Speaker 6>like I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with fat,</v>

1292
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:01.460
<v Speaker 6>with like all the spices,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with wine,</v>

1293
01:01:01.461 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 6>with Cognac,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with layers of like,</v>

1294
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.833
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even like organ meats in there and you </v>

1295
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.690
<v Speaker 6>put a crust over eighth and cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1296
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:10.810
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like we said,</v>

1297
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 6>it needs a lot of skills to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like good game.</v>

1298
01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had gamey venison.</v>

1299
01:01:15.911 --> 01:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I've been very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate that I've.</v>

1300
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.353
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to hunt from people that </v>

1301
01:01:20.381 --> 01:01:23.410
<v Speaker 2>really know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't let anything sit out in the</v>

1302
01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:26.530
<v Speaker 2>heat and made sure we opened it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooled it out quickly,</v>

1303
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that they do do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when guys are deep into the back country</v>

1304
01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:32.674
<v Speaker 2>and they have an animal and they kill it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's even in the summer when it's </v>

1305
01:01:36.011 --> 01:01:38.590
<v Speaker 2>warm out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do is they hang it and give it</v>

1306
01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:39.424
<v Speaker 2>a lot of air circulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It develops a crust on the outside and </v>

1307
01:01:42.671 --> 01:01:44.760
<v Speaker 2>then they cut that cross back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1308
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:48.850
<v Speaker 2>and then the meat underneath it is sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of tenderized and a lot of ways in a lot</v>

1309
01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:51.370
<v Speaker 2>of hunters say that it's even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious that way.</v>

1310
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.400
<v Speaker 2>It's protected by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the,</v>

1311
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.550
<v Speaker 2>by the crusty created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it probably starts.</v>

1312
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:00.220
<v Speaker 2>The bacteriological work starts to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of that crust.</v>

1313
01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.083
<v Speaker 2>There's age</v>

1314
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.820
<v Speaker 6>to process by which the meat gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>standard.</v>

1315
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:07.270
<v Speaker 6>The first one is the rigor Mortis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1316
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.850
<v Speaker 6>Like the meat rests and the rigor </v>
<v Speaker 6>mortis.</v>

1317
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.140
<v Speaker 6>I guess all the cortisol and everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>that like stiffens the meat at death.</v>

1318
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.453
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the meat will rest and then it's an </v>

1319
01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:17.014
<v Speaker 6>enzymatic reaction where the enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it can break some of the meat </v>

1320
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 6>fibers and the tougher muscles and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>in French.</v>

1321
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:24.654
<v Speaker 6>The word for arresting meet this called </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] on d and fasten is a </v>

1322
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 6>pheasant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1323
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.010
<v Speaker 6>because they used to hang the pheasants </v>
<v Speaker 6>by the neck until they fell.</v>

1324
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Falls off the skull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they're ready to eat.</v>

1325
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that before.</v>

1326
01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.460
<v Speaker 3>That is so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to eat.</v>

1327
01:02:39.461 --> 01:02:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I've had it a couple of times when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like this,</v>

1328
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.693
<v Speaker 3>it tastes like death warmed over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is wrong with these </v>

1329
01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:46.630
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they eating it?</v>

1330
01:02:46.631 --> 01:02:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1331
01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot people love a strong flavors like </v>

1332
01:02:50.951 --> 01:02:54.760
<v Speaker 3>blue cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like munster cheese in Germany.</v>

1333
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1334
01:02:55.751 --> 01:02:59.020
<v Speaker 3>so this is all because ultimately if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just eat it fresh,</v>

1335
01:02:59.021 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 3>it's chicken of the woods really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1336
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 3>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1337
01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:06.940
<v Speaker 3>By letting it go a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting it ride a little bit.</v>

1338
01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>They get these like secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tertiary,</v>

1339
01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 3>intense flavors though</v>

1340
01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 6>maybe two or talking about probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't those traditional ways.</v>

1341
01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 6>You don't always know what you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why you do them,</v>

1342
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.350
<v Speaker 6>but maybe initially they're like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>incubate the know,</v>

1343
01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.840
<v Speaker 6>you immunize yourself a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1344
01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:26.893
<v Speaker 6>like the taste is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to love it after you're used to </v>

1345
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:32.304
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but initially it might be a way to have </v>

1346
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:35.214
<v Speaker 6>some of the bacteria is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you talked about soil based </v>

1347
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 6>probiotics before I read about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we're realizing that like okay,</v>

1348
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:45.240
<v Speaker 6>yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>probiotics are not the whole thing,</v>

1349
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so maybe there's soil based probiotic,</v>

1350
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:48.114
<v Speaker 6>animal based probiotic maybe were </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely wrong about what flora we're </v>

1351
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.710
<v Speaker 6>ingesting and maybe there was like a way</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get your flora.</v>

1352
01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>makes sense.</v>

1353
01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:01.050
<v Speaker 6>I guess there would be some strategies </v>
<v Speaker 6>for taking that stuff in,</v>

1354
01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:01.884
<v Speaker 6>but I would think flavor wise it would </v>
<v Speaker 6>mean cause pheasant if you just eat it </v>

1355
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:07.410
<v Speaker 6>fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's delicious.</v>

1356
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 6>It's light.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very nice.</v>

1357
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Like I would think that</v>

1358
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.810
<v Speaker 3>unless there was no other way to store </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and they didn't have refrigeration,</v>

1359
01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:16.280
<v Speaker 3>which of course they didn't when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>first start.</v>

1360
01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:18.800
<v Speaker 3>Refrigeration is a super modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>invention.</v>

1361
01:04:18.801 --> 01:04:19.634
<v Speaker 3>If you look back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I worked for chefs in my </v>

1362
01:04:22.521 --> 01:04:27.320
<v Speaker 3>apprenticeship that told me stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their apprenticeship and it's like</v>

1363
01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:28.154
<v Speaker 3>night and day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said when we woke up in the </v>

1364
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:30.344
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to have to fill the ovens with </v>

1365
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:33.740
<v Speaker 3>coal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1366
01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:38.570
<v Speaker 3>and go down to the Ice Locker and dragon</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice block into through the,</v>

1367
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.290
<v Speaker 3>what's that stuff called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Wood Sawdust,</v>

1368
01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.930
<v Speaker 3>this sawdust shed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1369
01:04:44.931 --> 01:04:46.100
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1370
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of these old French </v>

1371
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:53.051
<v Speaker 3>restaurants that are famous had coal </v>
<v Speaker 3>fired ovens and ice block fridges</v>

1372
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 6>and the apprentices would live above and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they take shifts.</v>

1373
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one night they'd be you that would make </v>

1374
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 6>sure it doesn't die because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 6>it'd be hard to start again,</v>

1375
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:04.794
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1376
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:08.000
<v Speaker 3>like burn every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it,</v>

1377
01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:11.750
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The restaurant stove was ultimately,</v>

1378
01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:14.210
<v Speaker 3>it was also heating the whole building </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1379
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:20.370
<v Speaker 3>The hotel was heated by the wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but makes sense.</v>

1380
01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really does,</v>

1381
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:23.643
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a lot of animals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would let it get that funky other </v>

1382
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 3>than shark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shark.</v>

1383
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing the Iceland or a shark.</v>

1384
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a Korean dish that I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious to try,</v>

1385
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 3>it's Cape Wing that is fermented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until it gets that ammonia flavor,</v>

1386
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:42.514
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you smell a camel bear and they </v>

1387
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:46.270
<v Speaker 3>pause and you smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smells good,</v>

1388
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.940
<v Speaker 3>funky cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go a bit deeper,</v>

1389
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:50.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger width.</v>

1390
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:51.980
<v Speaker 3>And then we were like windex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1391
01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:52.814
<v Speaker 3>you got the ammonia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people look for that different </v>

1392
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:55.894
<v Speaker 3>cultures or into different flavors is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of my nandy went to Calcutta </v>

1393
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.143
<v Speaker 3>three weeks ago and came back with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number one candy in Calcutta or in </v>

1394
01:06:04.601 --> 01:06:05.020
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>

1395
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird candy called pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we had one right now,</v>

1396
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:09.604
<v Speaker 3>all three of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a repulsive candy that tastes </v>

1397
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:16.471
<v Speaker 3>incredibly of sulfur and fecal rot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in,</v>

1398
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 3>in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the candy.</v>

1399
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Like people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1400
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 3>in American winemaking and French </v>
<v Speaker 3>winemaking,</v>

1401
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 3>there's things in winemaking called </v>
<v Speaker 3>flaws,</v>

1402
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:31.650
<v Speaker 3>the flaws of wine in France and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural winemaking,</v>

1403
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 3>organic winemaking will always be </v>
<v Speaker 3>volatile.</v>

1404
01:06:34.151 --> 01:06:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Acidity and Bertino miceys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1405
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 3>volatile acidity smells in the wine </v>
<v Speaker 3>vastly of vinegar.</v>

1406
01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:47.260
<v Speaker 3>And Bertetto miceys smells vastly of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fecal matter.</v>

1407
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Barnyard fecal matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these in,</v>

1409
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:51.634
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in North American wine and even in </v>

1410
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:55.850
<v Speaker 3>French wine are considered as flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1411
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:01.290
<v Speaker 3>in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love natural wines from France that</v>

1412
01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:04.114
<v Speaker 3>have high volatile acidity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>brettanomyces smells what would be </v>

1413
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:09.874
<v Speaker 3>ultimately considered a flawed wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And France and natural wine world is </v>

1414
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 3>considered a delicacy in Japan and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural wine world.</v>

1415
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do they purposely take ones that have</v>

1416
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 3>that funky smell and ship them off to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan?</v>

1417
01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:23.374
<v Speaker 3>Some winemakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the line agent will come and visit the </v>

1418
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 3>seller and usually the winemaker will </v>
<v Speaker 3>point him in the direction and say,</v>

1419
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe this might be for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1420
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what we like.</v>

1421
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.420
<v Speaker 3>We'll take cultivated on purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I figure like a,</v>

1422
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.480
<v Speaker 3>nobody right now will come up and say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>outright.</v>

1423
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.983
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe so as Japanese there are </v>

1424
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:50.131
<v Speaker 3>Japanese winemakers now all through </v>
<v Speaker 3>France that work in a very funky way and</v>

1425
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:52.340
<v Speaker 3>are more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1426
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 3>pushing those wines into the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

1427
01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:55.114
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to try this just because it's </v>

1428
01:07:56.231 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tell me what the name of the candy is</v>

1429
01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:01.930
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulse misspelled that put you lsc.</v>

1430
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a green mango candy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1431
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:05.523
<v Speaker 3>it's originally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a classic snuck right where they </v>

1432
01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:08.763
<v Speaker 3>use the sulfur salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called black salt and they'd put a </v>

1433
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>bit of Chili and sulfur salt on mango </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have to admit that when I had</v>

1434
01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.190
<v Speaker 6>the real green mango with the sulfur </v>
<v Speaker 6>salt is not that bad.</v>

1435
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 6>That candy was like pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the mega warheads,</v>

1436
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we had as kids.</v>

1437
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 6>I wonder too sometimes the Gamey flavor </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the cheese.</v>

1438
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 6>That is the yield of that is I see it </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes as a bit of a like,</v>

1439
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ghost peppers,</v>

1440
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.350
<v Speaker 6>a bit of a pissing contest between,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1441
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:41.710
<v Speaker 6>like it's like no one could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>enjoy the taste of gross prep.</v>

1442
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.600
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1443
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.650

<v Speaker 6>does it even have a taste?</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you even responding to that taste.</v>

01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:07.590
<v Speaker 6>We sat in the kids a Marco and Fred goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Gab goes,</v>

1496
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 6>Gabrielle drop pro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

1497
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.950
<v Speaker 6>they rent a suite and they prepare all </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the</v>

1498
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.233
<v Speaker 4>up to weight cut and afterwards and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have nutritional requirements for </v>

1499
01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:22.020
<v Speaker 4>the weight cut and like the week they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1500
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 4>they have a nutritionist there with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1501
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:28.430
<v Speaker 4>but then they had lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my,</v>

1502
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:29.303
<v Speaker 4>I have a take on that is if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutritionist writes a plan and the </v>

1503
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 4>food's not good and you don't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it doesn't.</v>

1504
01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1505
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Like Amoeba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right on paper.</v>

1506
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't take the pill then you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't just say chicken and Kale,</v>

1507
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 4>this much grams this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we can.</v>

1508
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:45.743
<v Speaker 4>Professional Cook will make the Kale </v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious or Brussels Brian's chicken </v>

1509
01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:55.790
<v Speaker 4>properly because the Kale could be bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the chicken and be dry thing too.</v>

1510
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 4>That works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are already suffering.</v>

1511
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 4>The thing that works the best in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>case is that all of a sudden you have in</v>

1512
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 4>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we set up a little table which is so.</v>

1513
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not like playstation dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>underwears,</v>

1514
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:11.630
<v Speaker 4>pre-fight vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dining with friends,</v>

1515
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:15.380
<v Speaker 4>it's dining with friends and whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Marco Gab me,</v>

1516
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 4>we know we don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to talk,</v>

1517
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're here,</v>

1518
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll,</v>

1519
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.221
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll hang out.</v>

1520
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 4>But then you feel like your eggs in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tortilla,</v>

1521
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:27.720
<v Speaker 4>you feel like your eggs with potatoes or</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's mellow and it helps a lot with</v>

1522
01:12:27.721 --> 01:12:28.554
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the context of not being like </v>

1523
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.980
<v Speaker 4>ordering pizza from room service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1524
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Jordan used to tell us all horror </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>

1525
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.313
<v Speaker 4>We know before some of his biggest wins </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago with George say eating like </v>

1526
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:45.050
<v Speaker 4>room service Rigatoni and pizza before </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a major fight.</v>

1527
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.153
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now it's different and it's fun </v>

1528
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:55.101
<v Speaker 4>because like David said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have many interests and it's great to</v>

1529
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 4>be able to explore them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1530
01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.273
<v Speaker 4>because we couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't do this job if it was for </v>

1531
01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:06.180
<v Speaker 4>like 12 stoves in the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of pans,</v>

1532
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:07.283
<v Speaker 4>cooking pieces of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing books about the seasons and </v>

1533
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 4>tomatoes and starting again.</v>

1534
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do it.</v>

1535
01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Like we love that being a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one dimensional really,</v>

1536
01:13:16.861 --> 01:13:17.694
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that whether it's like Olivia with </v>

1537
01:13:19.331 --> 01:13:20.164
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like going to visit and Neil farm </v>

1538
01:13:21.211 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

1539
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:23.543
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's makes it worthwhile up to this </v>

1540
01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:28.104
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you guys have a great philosophy </v>

1541
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:30.624

<v Speaker 4>that really came through with the board </v>

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Like people don't think about that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get into this job,</v>

1609
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1610
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.300
<v Speaker 3>they think it's this warrior thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this were savage.</v>

<v Speaker 3>buy but buy a sailboat.</v>

1615
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 3>You have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1616
01:17:15.771 --> 01:17:19.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can't live that life of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking.</v>

1617
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 3>And why do you think that life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>synonymous with chefs?</v>

1618

<v Speaker 3>you will persevere.</v>

1620
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 3>If you understand how to promote </v>
<v Speaker 3>excessive eating and excessive drinking,</v>

1621
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.953
<v Speaker 3>you will be recompensed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you build a place where people come </v>

1622
01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:41.780
<v Speaker 3>and eat too much and drink too much and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that spend too much,</v>

1623
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:43.580

01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 3>a house,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what a restaurant looks like and how to </v>

<v Speaker 3>different idiosyncrasies.</v>

1634
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.240
<v Speaker 3>But for my whole apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol was a reward.</v>

1635
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1642
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not every word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's forget about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Shitty food industry.</v>

1647
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:43.994
<v Speaker 3>But we're also in the wine industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>because 50 percent of what you're doing </v>

1648
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:46.694
<v Speaker 3>is selling food to people and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of what you're doing is </v>

1649
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:49.304
<v Speaker 3>selling alcohol to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by default you're part of the people </v>

1655
01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a little bit of celebrity.</v>

1656

<v Speaker 3>Had been open for 15 years and you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and he'd go to the seven days in a </v>

1657
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 3>week or seven days in a week and I drank</v>
<v Speaker 3>six of them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just kind of recovering and then </v>

1659
01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:27.443
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is one week turns into two </v>

1660
01:19:28.551 --> 01:19:29.384
<v Speaker 3>to four and then you kind of look back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you realize in 2017 that you may </v>

1661
01:19:34.161 --> 01:19:39.161
<v Speaker 3>have drank 48 weeks out of 52,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1662
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:42.853
<v Speaker 3>and then it goes quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's 10 years and you're a 10 year </v>

1663
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:46.904
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and you've been drinking five</v>
<v Speaker 3>days out of the week for 10 years and </v>

1664
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden you kind of have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1665
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:58.991
<v Speaker 3>You realize that like my day to day is </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on food and wine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All the foods are better for it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1672
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:24.030

<v Speaker 3>idea that you weren't able to control it</v>

1673
01:20:24.031 --> 01:20:24.864
<v Speaker 3>or just that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of this decision would be to </v>

<v Speaker 3>just completely eliminated textbook case</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a person who couldn't.</v>

01:22:33.651 --> 01:22:37.220
<v Speaker 3>relationship with alcohol became not </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive with help.</v>

1722
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I understood through with education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood.</v>

1723
01:22:39.891 --> 01:22:44.891
<v Speaker 3>And now everything's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny too because I cited it as,</v>

1724
01:22:45.471 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an example,</v>

1725
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:48.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to tell him,</v>

1726
01:22:48.111 --> 01:22:49.820
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentoring,</v>

1727
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the canary in the coal mine for </v>

1728
01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:54.020
<v Speaker 3>and I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1730
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.980
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
01:22:54.981 --> 01:22:56.900
<v Speaker 3>after Tony passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1732
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1733
01:22:58.011 --> 01:23:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was working in a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>project doing tilings and it's like,</v>

1734
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard the news in the morning.</v>

1735
01:23:04.251 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went tile all day</v>

1736
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 6>and then I couldn't wait to get home and</v>
<v Speaker 6>have like two bottles of wine.</v>

1737
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

1738
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 6>And we were the same about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't matter.</v>

1739
01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:18.190
<v Speaker 6>Like what we love that appoint look for </v>
<v Speaker 6>example,</v>

1740
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 6>we loved mma read,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we love going to the fights.</v>

1741
01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 6>We were so fortunate would go and see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We met the FERTITTA brothers.</v>

1742
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:27.760
<v Speaker 6>They discussed like we sat with them at </v>
<v Speaker 6>dinner table,</v>

1743
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 6>we met you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we met all those guys.</v>

1744
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.780
<v Speaker 6>David loves wine making all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>winemakers.</v>

1745
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 6>We met the best people in the field that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we loved.</v>

1746
01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:37.600
<v Speaker 6>Charmed life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not happy,</v>

1747
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:41.610
<v Speaker 6>not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like ungrateful fucking little bricks.</v>

1748
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1749
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:45.070
<v Speaker 6>I think part of the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol is a depressant.</v>

1750
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.750
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just,</v>

1751
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get down,</v>

1752
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:49.740
<v Speaker 6>it just</v>

1753
01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.970
<v Speaker 3>brings you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings you down,</v>

1754
01:23:50.971 --> 01:23:51.804
<v Speaker 3>it brings your energy level down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bringing alcohol is a solvent and it </v>

1755
01:23:55.921 --> 01:23:59.880
<v Speaker 3>destroys your soft brain tissue and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was taught that in Rehab.</v>

1756
01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So when you drink acetone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1757
01:24:02.191 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1758
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 3>if it was made by a lovely French </v>
<v Speaker 3>vineyard with Barney Aroma,</v>

1759
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>but do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you miss anything about the flavor of</v>

1760
01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:15.710
<v Speaker 3>wine with a meal or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried not to.</v>

1761
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:19.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to wine tastings.</v>

1762
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.840
<v Speaker 3>I was just that raw wine and less in Los</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>

1763
01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.733
<v Speaker 3>I went to taste all the natural wines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful natural wine festival and you </v>

1764
01:24:26.191 --> 01:24:27.630
<v Speaker 3>can taste them still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taste them.</v>

1765
01:24:27.631 --> 01:24:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rinse my mouth out.</v>

1766
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:30.343
<v Speaker 3>I'm very much involved in natural wine </v>
<v Speaker 3>and viticulture reading and all that </v>

1767
01:24:36.151 --> 01:24:36.984
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be so weird to have a </v>

1768
01:24:37.561 --> 01:24:39.030
<v Speaker 3>mouthful of delicious one.</v>

1769
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:40.500
<v Speaker 3>Just spit it into a bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1770
01:24:40.501 --> 01:24:41.880
<v Speaker 3>it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1771
01:24:41.881 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1772
01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:46.350
<v Speaker 3>because that's why did I drink wine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll factory the nose.</v>

1773
01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:49.580
<v Speaker 3>The flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understanding the winemaker,</v>

1774
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.453
<v Speaker 3>his philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the geography of where the wine comes </v>

1775
01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:56.340
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his work with,</v>

1776
01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:57.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with using organic and biodynamic </v>

1777
01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:01.260
<v Speaker 3>viticulture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not using sulfur,</v>

1778
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:02.323
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just making this amazing organic </v>

1779
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.320
<v Speaker 3>beverage with very little intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natural line without side effects.</v>

1780
01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to swallow it because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug is the same drug that it's in.</v>

1781
01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.730
<v Speaker 3>That's in all the other ones that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't change flavors.</v>

1782
01:25:17.731 --> 01:25:18.810
<v Speaker 3>What's different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1783
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I like is more of the story,</v>

1784
01:25:20.941 --> 01:25:22.460
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vineyard,</v>

1785
01:25:22.461 --> 01:25:23.670
<v Speaker 3>the varietals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1786
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:24.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you eat at a fine restaurant and </v>

01:25:25.741 --> 01:25:30.390
<v Speaker 3>have a delicious steak and wine </v>
<v Speaker 3>accompaniment and then just spit it into</v>

1788
01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:31.260
<v Speaker 3>a bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really worried.</v>

1791
01:25:34.231 --> 01:25:36.000
<v Speaker 3>He shuts his mouth and he goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom.</v>

1792
01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mouth full of wine.</v>

1793
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:40.103
<v Speaker 3>Ryan Ryan grave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our friend from Elaina that worked with </v>

1794
01:25:42.781 --> 01:25:46.200
<v Speaker 3>us for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan goes to a restaurant and acts for a</v>

1795
01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:47.034
<v Speaker 3>bucket and he'll sit with other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wine business and they all drink </v>

1796
01:25:51.961 --> 01:25:52.794
<v Speaker 3>wine and he tastes the wine and he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions about wine and he tastes it </v>

1797
01:25:56.131 --> 01:25:58.170
<v Speaker 3>and spits it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an alcoholic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

1800
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Was My mentor when</v>

1801
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 5>I got out of Rehab because in Rehab they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were telling me you may never be able to</v>

1802
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:13.190
<v Speaker 5>go back to the restaurant was a high </v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of reoffending.</v>

1803
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>actually still tasted and still it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like if you're a heroin,</v>

1837
01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 5>a heroin addict just scratching the skin</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the needle.</v>

1838
01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 5>We don't penetrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't recommend that my,</v>

1839
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:46.003
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my therapist and the people that Rehab </v>

1840
01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 5>do not recommend that I taste wine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>spit it,</v>

1841
01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.220
<v Speaker 5>but they don't.</v>

1842
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 5>But I have friends again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of Somalis and even I,</v>

1843
01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:55.544
<v Speaker 5>I know winemakers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the most famous wine makers in </v>

1844
01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:59.144
<v Speaker 5>the world I've met in burgundy in a bed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are completely sober because they </v>

1845
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:05.234
<v Speaker 5>wanted to break this cycle of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My great grandfather was an alcoholic </v>

1846
01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:11.120
<v Speaker 5>abusive person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather was an alcoholic,</v>

1847
01:28:11.121 --> 01:28:13.520
<v Speaker 5>abusive person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My father was an alcoholic,</v>

1848
01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:18.320
<v Speaker 5>abusive person and I didn't want to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>over this thousand year old winery.</v>

1849
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:19.343
<v Speaker 5>The legacy of my family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to work here and I'm sure </v>

1850
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:22.160
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1851
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:22.993
<v Speaker 5>All the Epi genetics stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't drink when your kids are </v>

1852
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:27.614
<v Speaker 5>young and like they might be a thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you can stop the passing of the </v>

1853
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 5>gene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you did sober October.</v>

1854
01:28:32.691 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 5>How'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fine?</v>

1855
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I did love it.</v>

1856
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:37.663
<v Speaker 5>I was the relapse sobriety wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was a very crazy sober October </v>

1857
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 5>because we added this in St fitness </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenge,</v>

1858
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:44.503
<v Speaker 5>so I was literally working out between </v>
<v Speaker 5>three and a half to five and a half one </v>

1859
01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Six and a half hours in a day.</v>

1860
01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:52.880
<v Speaker 5>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One day I did five and a half hours.</v>

1861
01:28:52.881 --> 01:28:53.714
<v Speaker 5>I did another hour at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six and a half hours in the day it was </v>

1862
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.880
<v Speaker 5>was trying to kill each other to see who</v>
<v Speaker 5>could get the most points.</v>

1863
01:28:58.881 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 5>We have a fitness tracker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We wore a heart rate</v>

1864
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 2>monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that the kitchen would score up </v>

1865
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 2>the amount of points you would get if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>won the belt right there.</v>

1866
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>If you get a 70 percent of your max </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart rate,</v>

1867
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you get three points per minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how crazy it got.</v>

1868
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Seventy percent of your Max heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>is three points per minute.</v>

1869
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Eighty percent and above your Max heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate is four points per minute.</v>

1870
01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 2>One day I got a thousand points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just think about that.</v>

1871
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Think about how many minutes you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise at 80 percent of your max heart</v>

1872
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:29.970
<v Speaker 2>rate to get a thousand fucking points.</v>

1873
01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.760
<v Speaker 6>So you think sober help you with </v>
<v Speaker 6>performance or recoup?</v>

1874
01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I think I was on drugs the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>

1875
01:29:36.541 --> 01:29:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I think I was on the endorphins that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from long range cardio.</v>

1876
01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:41.700
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1877
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a what I was calling the don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck drug.</v>

1878
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 2>There's you get this feeling when you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qa,</v>

1879
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:49.833
<v Speaker 2>like everybody always talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>runner's high and I never really </v>

1880
01:29:51.361 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 2>experienced it even though I'd worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out really hard my whole life.</v>

1881
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been into like long range </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>

1882
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd never done hours and hours of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same activity,</v>

1883
01:30:01.351 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>just droning on either on a bike or </v>
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

1884
01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:05.843
<v Speaker 2>I'd never really done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd run hills for the most part and I'm </v>

1885
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 2>sure it benefited me and it made me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made me relaxed.</v>

1886
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.353
<v Speaker 2>But is it a totally different level when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it for three and a half </v>

1887
01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:16.230
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours a day?</v>

1888
01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.570
<v Speaker 2>It's true survival mechanism that kicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1889
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:20.070
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

1890
01:30:20.071 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you feel wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1891
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you have zero anxiety</v>

1892
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.810
<v Speaker 6>and you're still benefiting from that?</v>

1893
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1894
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:28.030
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's interesting.</v>

1895
01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been out of the house for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week now because of the fires,</v>

1896
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:33.633
<v Speaker 2>so we've been running around and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids aren't in school so they're here </v>

1897
01:30:36.761 --> 01:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with me and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1898
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1899
01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.930
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had a chance to get our stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1900
01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.793
<v Speaker 2>so it's been very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't really been working out </v>

1901
01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:46.474
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only worked out once or twice this </v>

1902
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:49.570
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have more stress.</v>

1903
01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a little bit more tense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more,</v>

1904
01:30:51.941 --> 01:30:53.530
<v Speaker 2>take a deep breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down.</v>

1905
01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.920
<v Speaker 2>During October I had none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>

1906
01:30:56.921 --> 01:30:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was like,</v>

1907
01:30:59.441 --> 01:31:02.980
<v Speaker 2>if you could take how I feel and put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pill form and give it to people,</v>

1908
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.113
<v Speaker 2>everyone will be hooked on it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel fantastic and I never </v>

1909
01:31:06.731 --> 01:31:07.564
<v Speaker 2>understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would see these people running every </v>

1910
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:11.950
<v Speaker 2>day and I thought they were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise fanatics,</v>

1911
01:31:11.951 --> 01:31:16.951
<v Speaker 2>like they just want to be leaner or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to just keep maybe the test.</v>

1912
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what it was,</v>

1913
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.490
<v Speaker 2>but I think there are drug addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are natural drug addicts,</v>

1914
01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:25.300
<v Speaker 2>but in a very positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't call it drug addicts,</v>

1915
01:31:25.301 --> 01:31:27.670
<v Speaker 2>endorphin junkies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are.</v>

1916
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:29.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes sense to do that.</v>

1917
01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:33.800
<v Speaker 6>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every cycle in nature,</v>

1918
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:37.610
<v Speaker 6>it's like feast and famine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like running and resting.</v>

1919
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.010
<v Speaker 6>You know if you follow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're a hunter gatherer,</v>

1920
01:31:40.011 --> 01:31:43.130
<v Speaker 6>you don't hunt every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1921
01:31:43.131 --> 01:31:45.200
<v Speaker 6>you follow a cycle is still free for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>month,</v>

1922
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.310
<v Speaker 6>you'll hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll drag back the meat,</v>

1923
01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.830
<v Speaker 6>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tomi elite a lot,</v>

1924
01:31:48.831 --> 01:31:51.350
<v Speaker 6>and then after the next month there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll be quiet,</v>

1925
01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.213
<v Speaker 6>you'll eat less and then the next month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's very little exercise program </v>

1926
01:31:56.151 --> 01:31:59.380
<v Speaker 6>out there that look at it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you were to look at it over year,</v>

1927
01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 6>maybe you'd see it.</v>

1928
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I see no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>October is more quiet.</v>

1929
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll do my month in October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November,</v>

1930
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 3>we'll be quiet busy with other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that.</v>

1931
01:32:07.241 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back to it in December.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better for the soul too.</v>

1932
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:14.620
<v Speaker 3>You don't have this obsession looming </v>
<v Speaker 3>over you that you have to do it tomorrow</v>

1933
01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>morning and night and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1934
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>well my take on it was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1935
01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:18.904
<v Speaker 2>My take on it is that everyone's anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels and all the different stress and </v>

1936
01:32:21.221 --> 01:32:22.054
<v Speaker 2>all the things we deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is because your body has </v>

1937
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 2>capabilities and you're not using even a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small percentage of those capabilities.</v>

1938
01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:31.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

1939
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 2>We're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go.</v>

1940
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:33.470
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1941
01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:34.803
<v Speaker 2>and we're in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're moving quickly so you're </v>

1942
01:32:36.371 --> 01:32:37.204
<v Speaker 2>constantly aware of all these cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you and there's all the stress </v>

1943
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:44.380
<v Speaker 2>and there's very little physical release</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the body takes part in and for most</v>

1944
01:32:44.381 --> 01:32:45.214
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the the great percentage of our </v>

1945
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:50.110
<v Speaker 2>population lives a sedentary lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sit in their cars until they get to</v>

1946
01:32:50.111 --> 01:32:50.944
<v Speaker 2>the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sit in their office until they get </v>

1947
01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sit in front of the TV till they go</v>

1948
01:32:53.321 --> 01:32:53.740
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>

1949
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.400
<v Speaker 2>This is a giant percentage of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

1950
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:57.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever number the number is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1951
01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.553
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very normal and occasionally they </v>

1952
01:32:59.621 --> 01:33:01.480
<v Speaker 2>work out and when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a struggle.</v>

1953
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:06.990
<v Speaker 2>When you force the body into rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise on a constant basis,</v>

1954
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:12.580
<v Speaker 2>your body's all the needs and have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity,</v>

1955
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 2>the capabilities that it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those needs are satisfied.</v>

1956
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:16.083
<v Speaker 2>So what I found is incredibly low </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety levels and I didn't think I had </v>

1957
01:33:20.021 --> 01:33:20.854
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an anxious person to the point </v>

1958
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 2>where I thought about taking medication </v>
<v Speaker 2>for anxiety,</v>

1959
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 2>like I'm nervous or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't.</v>

1960
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how anxiety free I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be until I did this exercise program for</v>

1961
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:35.330
<v Speaker 2>a month.</v>

1962
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:36.590
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found that in sobriety,</v>

1963
01:33:36.591 --> 01:33:38.600
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suffered.</v>

1964
01:33:38.690 --> 01:33:40.800
<v Speaker 3>I suffered from anxiety our whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>careers.</v>

1965
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,</v>

1966
01:33:43.641 --> 01:33:45.340
<v Speaker 3>300 people are coming for dinner at my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1967
01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.950
<v Speaker 3>it's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My scribbling is their staff.</v>

1968
01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.960
<v Speaker 3>There's 300 people coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never goes away.</v>

1969
01:33:50.961 --> 01:33:51.794
<v Speaker 3>There's always people coming for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's throwing happy 400 people every </v>

1970
01:33:55.221 --> 01:33:56.054
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was drinking that would just </v>

1971
01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:02.000
<v Speaker 3>keep the stress going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm fine.</v>

1972
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:05.030
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this magic number and it kept on</v>

1973
01:34:05.031 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 3>hearing and Rehab and he kept on hearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>through therapy.</v>

1974
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 weeks.</v>

1975
01:34:10.401 --> 01:34:10.821
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1976
01:34:10.821 --> 01:34:11.654
<v Speaker 3>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1977
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:14.810
<v Speaker 3>It was this fucking guys I was telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>you with your 16 weeks or 16 weeks,</v>

1978
01:34:14.811 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big watch.</v>

1979
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen weeks the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen weeks.</v>

1980
01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 3>That morning I woke up that morning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my phone set up to 16 weeks and I</v>

1981
01:34:28.851 --> 01:34:33.851
<v Speaker 3>had this peace and this joy and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood innocence that I hadn't had in</v>

1982
01:34:39.381 --> 01:34:42.530
<v Speaker 3>years on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen weeks.</v>

1983
01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Not because I'd been premeditating into </v>
<v Speaker 3>my head and I was looking forward to the</v>

1984
01:34:45.441 --> 01:34:46.640
<v Speaker 3>16 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe in it,</v>

1985
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:51.380
<v Speaker 3>but it was literally 16 weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sobriety that brought this.</v>

1986
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I was clear that during this club that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had no problem.</v>

1987
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll be in half an hour.</v>

1988
01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as it should be free.</v>

1989
01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Just don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lights are out in the restaurant and</v>

1990
01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.330
<v Speaker 4>five tables are unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming down.</v>

1991
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you think</v>

1992
01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:06.843
<v Speaker 2>some of the anxiety was just your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to the fact that you were </v>

1993
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.280
<v Speaker 2>poisoning?</v>

1994
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.113
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think it's the psyche creating reasons </v>

1995
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:16.243
<v Speaker 4>for you to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mind is telling you you're </v>

1996
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 4>stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a quick remedy for it.</v>

1997
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you try drinking that makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel this way?</v>

1998
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 4>What's your go to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

1999
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.280
<v Speaker 4>I could taste sometimes when I'd fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>into stacks,</v>

2000
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:32.150
<v Speaker 4>full situations at the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three tables.</v>

2001
01:35:32.151 --> 01:35:36.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't like a couple of criminal </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements behaving badly at one table,</v>

2002
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:37.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm the board or of lacking </v>

2003
01:35:39.471 --> 01:35:43.310
<v Speaker 4>respect to their waitress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have to get involved and I could</v>

2004
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.450
<v Speaker 4>almost taste chardonnay and delivery </v>
<v Speaker 4>glads yeah,</v>

2005
01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:47.293
<v Speaker 4>your brain's still plays a trick on </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain was making me high before the </v>

2006
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.070
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always like,</v>

2007
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.713
<v Speaker 4>why do I taste Chablis in my mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the same with sugar </v>

2008
01:35:57.741 --> 01:35:58.574
<v Speaker 4>addiction too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where people eat sugar or lots </v>

2009
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:02.600
<v Speaker 4>of carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly carbs.</v>

2010
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:04.310
<v Speaker 4>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>

2011
01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

2012
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I have to go for three hours without </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>

2013
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:07.423
<v Speaker 4>I have to bring something sweet with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going to get shaky and then </v>

2014
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.660
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your.</v>

2015
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:15.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're feeding basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's your gut biome that</v>

2016
01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.260
<v Speaker 4>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're like feeding a monster inside</v>

2017
01:36:18.261 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 4>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not feeding Fred or David,</v>

2018
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 4>you're feeding something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2019
01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 4>like you're planning a weekend at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cottage or like the kids are going to be</v>

2020
01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:26.744
<v Speaker 4>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to bring two more </v>

2021
01:36:27.471 --> 01:36:28.304
<v Speaker 4>bottles of wine and have to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the wine is cold and have to make </v>

2022
01:36:30.981 --> 01:36:34.220
<v Speaker 4>sure we have that or like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have friends like that.</v>

2023
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.373
<v Speaker 4>I have to make sure you have like for </v>
<v Speaker 4>granola bars because they have to eat </v>

2024
01:36:37.071 --> 01:36:37.904
<v Speaker 4>all the time and you know that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have breakfast you have like a </v>

2025
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:41.864
<v Speaker 4>quick coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go to like four or five in the </v>

2026
01:36:43.251 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 4>afternoon and not shaking and getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>cold and Sweaty,</v>

2027
01:36:47.770 --> 01:36:48.603
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2028
01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends.</v>

2029
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you have a good healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

2030
01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:53.770
<v Speaker 2>If your body's not like sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar dependent,</v>

2031
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:54.783
<v Speaker 4>I think it's funny every time you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes we fall off the wagon and </v>

2032
01:36:59.321 --> 01:37:01.420
<v Speaker 4>stuff not as pretty solid for a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2033
01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that two weeks of drinking more </v>
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>

2034
01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.173
<v Speaker 4>having walks and not eating ice cream </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fries and two weeks of home cooked </v>

2035
01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:12.874
<v Speaker 4>meals and water cutting down on coffee </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that dude will fuck with your </v>

2036
01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:17.020
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2037
01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.240
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We noticed that both of us,</v>

2038
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:21.250
<v Speaker 4>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so many diseases,</v>

2039
01:37:21.251 --> 01:37:25.960
<v Speaker 4>is based simply on overconsumption just </v>
<v Speaker 4>period over consumption of cigarettes,</v>

2040
01:37:25.961 --> 01:37:28.030
<v Speaker 4>over consumption of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over consumption of sugar,</v>

2041
01:37:28.031 --> 01:37:33.031
<v Speaker 4>over consumption of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carbs like restriction brings clarity.</v>

2042
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.193
<v Speaker 2>December restriction diets are one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best remedies for people with </v>

2043
01:37:36.271 --> 01:37:37.770
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2044
01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2045
01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:39.503
<v Speaker 2>cut down almost everything out of your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that people are doing </v>

2046
01:37:41.641 --> 01:37:42.474
<v Speaker 2>today that's very popular but keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this unfortunately is the </v>

2047
01:37:44.911 --> 01:37:45.744
<v Speaker 2>carnivore diet because Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it very popular when he was on the </v>

2048
01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:51.300
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>

2049
01:37:51.301 --> 01:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a spike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the Google search results</v>

2050
01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>or carnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's July</v>

2051
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 5>of 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes like this.</v>

2052
01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 5>He takes off because that's the day that</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan was on the podcast,</v>

2053
01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 5>so he's in the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2054
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:05.123
<v Speaker 5>fucking whatever amount of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people listening to this in order and </v>

2055
01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.473
<v Speaker 5>because of his ranting and raving about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the positive benefits that he's </v>

2056
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 5>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I got on the carnivore diet.</v>

2057
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 5>People really got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I got into it as well,</v>

2058
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:18.654
<v Speaker 5>like what is it about this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started consulting a lot of actual </v>

2059
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:22.404
<v Speaker 5>nutrition experts and scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they believe is what's going on as </v>

2060
01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:25.764
<v Speaker 5>calorie restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That because of the fact that you're </v>

2061
01:38:27.391 --> 01:38:28.224
<v Speaker 5>only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan is only eating steak with salt </v>

2062
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:32.783
<v Speaker 5>and drinking water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is all he's consuming and he feels </v>

2063
01:38:34.921 --> 01:38:38.520
<v Speaker 5>fantastic because it's a lean steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now real estate,</v>

2064
01:38:38.670 --> 01:38:39.241
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatty.</v>

2065
01:38:39.241 --> 01:38:41.460
<v Speaker 5>So then you can't do much because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the fat.</v>

2066
01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.810
<v Speaker 5>You're feeling full.</v>

2067
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2068
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:46.140
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fat is important.</v>

2069
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:47.063
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because this is quite a few </v>

2070
01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:49.344
<v Speaker 5>autoimmune issues that he had went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was having receding gums that went </v>

2071
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:54.370
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2072
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:58.140
<v Speaker 5>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was having severe depression and anxiety</v>

2073
01:38:58.141 --> 01:38:59.640
<v Speaker 5>and all these different issues that went</v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

2074
01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 5>You announced a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight.</v>

2075
01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:05.790
<v Speaker 5>His body leaned up and science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The scientists that have talked about,</v>

2076
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.003
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a very new thing for people to </v>

2077
01:39:08.611 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 5>embark on this and do it on a mass scale</v>
<v Speaker 5>because quite a few people doing it.</v>

2078
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:13.763
<v Speaker 5>What they're attributing it to is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>calorie restriction is that because of </v>

2079
01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:17.244
<v Speaker 5>the fact that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really can't eat that much stake if </v>

2080
01:39:18.971 --> 01:39:20.640
<v Speaker 5>you eat a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2081
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:23.860
<v Speaker 5>it might be a thousand calories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if immediate,</v>

2082
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.713
<v Speaker 5>full,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big fixed day closet galleries the </v>

2083
01:39:26.951 --> 01:39:28.470
<v Speaker 5>stakes a lot at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2084
01:39:28.471 --> 01:39:29.304
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean he might be eating two of </v>

2085
01:39:30.841 --> 01:39:31.800
<v Speaker 5>those in a day.</v>

2086
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:35.850
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you're eating French fries </v>
<v Speaker 5>and soda,</v>

2087
01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.530
<v Speaker 5>empty calories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting shade here.</v>

2088
01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Like way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you think?</v>

2089
01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:41.754
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an 18 ounce rib eye is if you had a </v>

2090
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 5>guest calorically 11,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1800 and 800,</v>

2091
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:52.050
<v Speaker 5>800 bands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have like the end of the rack in.</v>

2092
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.913
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's,</v>

2093
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 5>let's just get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's call it 700.</v>

2094
01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:55.993
<v Speaker 5>It's probably like at 1700 calories a </v>
<v Speaker 5>day because he's not putting cream in </v>

2095
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:00.143
<v Speaker 5>the coffee's not having a seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the water went steak when I </v>

2096
01:40:04.321 --> 01:40:05.700
<v Speaker 5>started eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No gluten,</v>

2097
01:40:05.701 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fully diagnosed,</v>

2098
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making this up.</v>

2099
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:11.220
<v Speaker 5>I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stopped eating gluten.</v>

2100
01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.650
<v Speaker 5>It gets flagged every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

2101
01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets crazy about the gluten </v>
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>

2102
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:17.130
<v Speaker 5>He is like here it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear it.</v>

2103
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to like what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what does it mean?</v>

2104
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:23.060
<v Speaker 5>You don't eat gluten?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smoking cigarettes,</v>

2105
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:24.600
<v Speaker 5>like come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what does it mean?</v>

2106
01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.320
<v Speaker 5>No gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means that you don't go to,</v>

2107
01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drive drew,</v>

2108
01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slip,</v>

2109
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no options out there in the fast</v>

2110
01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:34.380
<v Speaker 5>food world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no.</v>

2111
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.950
<v Speaker 5>So I have to plan my day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I like,</v>

2112
01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:40.320
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat a piece of meat for breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 5>with or eggs or whatever,</v>

2113
01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 5>and then I won't eat until like show up </v>
<v Speaker 5>at work or at home later and eat.</v>

2114
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 5>So it's with you've excluded that </v>
<v Speaker 5>counts.</v>

2115
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.333
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that this steak is so good for </v>

2116
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that you're not eating</v>

2117
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>all this processed food anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't eat it anymore.</v>

2118
01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what the scientists are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the people that are pro meet,</v>

2119
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as culty as the vegans are.</v>

2120
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>The people that are the real pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>carnivore diets,</v>

2121
01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:08.853
<v Speaker 2>they want you to think that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat that's healing and the meat that's </v>

2122
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>helping them meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's making them lean that meat.</v>

2123
01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hurting you.</v>

2124
01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nutritious.</v>

2125
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:18.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of real nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 2>and red meat and this is also a problem </v>

2126
01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:22.384
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of studies that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of vegans love to cite about </v>

2127
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:29.110
<v Speaker 2>heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strokes,</v>

2128
01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:32.890
<v Speaker 2>cancer in relationship to meet these </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemiology studies that were.</v>

2129
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 2>There essentially is they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2130
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:36.940
<v Speaker 2>when you look at people that eat meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>five days a week,</v>

2131
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 2>these are the people that have higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>instances of cancer,</v>

2132
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:42.070
<v Speaker 2>higher instances of diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things.</v>

2133
01:41:42.370 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Where they're not taking into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration is they're not just eating</v>

2134
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:45.694
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're usually eating a cheeseburger </v>

2135
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 2>with fries and a soda and there's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sugar.</v>

2136
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's before dinner and all this bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that's involved with the meat.</v>

2137
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:59.490
<v Speaker 2>There's not any studies that show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who eat a lot or a 12 ounce grass</v>

2138
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:04.930
<v Speaker 2>fed steak with a good plate of sauteed </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinach and olive oil and garlic,</v>

2139
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:05.764
<v Speaker 2>that these people are getting cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't make a nutritional study or </v>

2140
01:42:10.581 --> 01:42:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People fundamentally lie,</v>

2141
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:16.360
<v Speaker 2>so you cannot have people you cannot say</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2142
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 2>this is coco fat and beef tenderloin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you a week portion.</v>

2143
01:42:19.991 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 2>You'll go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you come to report.</v>

2144
01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:22.774
<v Speaker 2>We do blood tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get anecdotal evidence from people </v>

2145
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:27.280
<v Speaker 2>that talk about their own personal diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2146
01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:27.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2147
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult and it's also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically based.</v>

2148
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's on one side with the vegans</v>

2149
01:42:36.341 --> 01:42:38.260
<v Speaker 2>are the other side where the carnivore </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet people,</v>

2150
01:42:38.261 --> 01:42:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I find the same psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics in both groups.</v>

2151
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.380
<v Speaker 2>They want to convert people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to proselytize,</v>

2152
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:47.160
<v Speaker 2>they want people to think that their way</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the right way and they,</v>

2153
01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:50.110
<v Speaker 2>they are not honest about health issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're having.</v>

2154
01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:53.560
<v Speaker 2>You should make like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conference on a deserted island,</v>

2155
01:42:53.561 --> 01:42:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2156
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:55.083
<v Speaker 2>Richmond's gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a Bruce Lee movie and knew you </v>

2157
01:42:56.950 --> 01:43:00.310
<v Speaker 2>invite the vegans on one side and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell them you're also inviting the</v>

2158
01:43:00.311 --> 01:43:01.144
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2159
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.500
<v Speaker 2>and then both groups it just have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2160
01:43:04.130 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>well both think the other group is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drop dead at any second.</v>

2161
01:43:07.211 --> 01:43:08.044
<v Speaker 2>Now the proof is in the pudding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is on your podcast to talk </v>

2162
01:43:12.641 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>about eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's alive and he's not dead.</v>

2163
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:15.980
<v Speaker 2>So it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2164
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.720
<v Speaker 2>like white look any further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2165
01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:20.140
<v Speaker 2>who knows how long they're gonna last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2166
01:43:20.141 --> 01:43:22.200
<v Speaker 2>none of us are getting out of this alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2167
01:43:22.230 --> 01:43:24.320
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to meat,</v>

2168
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:29.820
<v Speaker 2>do you guys prefer a grass fed beef or </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like a corn fed?</v>

2169
01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:31.443
<v Speaker 2>Because I had this discussion with Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was telling me that he actually </v>

2170
01:43:34.901 --> 01:43:36.660
<v Speaker 2>likes corn fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2171
01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:37.503
<v Speaker 2>it's a fattier that there's two schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thought and then there's two schools </v>

2172
01:43:41.141 --> 01:43:44.080
<v Speaker 2>of what is quality beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2173
01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So one school say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2174
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>quality beef is organic</v>

2175
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.040
<v Speaker 3>animal pasture raised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating grass flavors different.</v>

2176
01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not as tender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is high quality beef.</v>

2177
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the other of course says,</v>

2178
01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cow Usta,</v>

2179
01:44:06.411 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 3>prime grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corn fed,</v>

2180
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 3>incredible marbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous fat content.</v>

2181
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Restricted motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say a lesser quality beef.</v>

2182
01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then then the other,</v>

2183
01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.200
<v Speaker 3>but they all start eating wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll pastored at first eating wise,</v>

2184
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gram per pound for pound.</v>

2185
01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.980
<v Speaker 3>The corn fed steak will be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

2186
01:44:36.850 --> 01:44:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some people.</v>

2187
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:42.340
<v Speaker 3>And then for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other one will be,</v>

2188
01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.233
<v Speaker 3>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grass fed organic pasture beef with </v>

2189
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:53.290
<v Speaker 3>a different flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me as a higher quality animal,</v>

2190
01:44:53.410 --> 01:44:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I prefer that taste correct.</v>

2191
01:44:55.261 --> 01:44:57.480
<v Speaker 4>I feel it's a Richard taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a denser,</v>

2192
01:44:57.481 --> 01:44:59.730
<v Speaker 4>darker meat more than iron taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:44:59.731 --> 01:45:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I just like it better and I do like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>corn fed steak.</v>

2194
01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:06.570
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the general public,</v>

2195
01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:07.463
<v Speaker 4>the steak eating public that come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants and counter more grow corn </v>

2196
01:45:12.811 --> 01:45:17.811
<v Speaker 4>fed beef that and the first judge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>character to the quality of that meat is</v>

2197
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:23.790
<v Speaker 4>tendering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tenderness.</v>

2198
01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:25.860
<v Speaker 4>It's marble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not tender.</v>

2199
01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not tender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a reoccurring thing that we fight</v>

2200
01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:29.364
<v Speaker 4>with every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A job while the tender to see the 16 </v>

2201
01:45:32.371 --> 01:45:36.180
<v Speaker 4>ounce fog walk tender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2202
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:37.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are they looking for?</v>

2203
01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Are Your teeth work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we get to take sent back.</v>

2204
01:45:41.281 --> 01:45:41.870
<v Speaker 4>It'll be big</v>

2205
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:42.703
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

2206
01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 4>it's too tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2207
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:46.263
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not always usually go to the </v>

2208
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:48.303
<v Speaker 4>steakhouse and it's tender because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bringing your serving a grass </v>

2209
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:52.330
<v Speaker 4>fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed,</v>

2210
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:55.960
<v Speaker 4>grass fed steak that's not as marbled </v>
<v Speaker 4>as.</v>

2211
01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:57.480
<v Speaker 4>It's not organic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2212
01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:59.530
<v Speaker 4>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an animal that's healthy,</v>

2213
01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.950
<v Speaker 4>but you can also have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an upgrade though.</v>

2214
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:04.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like the natural wine versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional wind fight.</v>

2215
01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we're having,</v>

2216
01:46:05.391 --> 01:46:05.920
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2217
01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:09.250
<v Speaker 4>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're calling it binary now.</v>

2218
01:46:09.251 --> 01:46:12.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's only corn or it's only </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass.</v>

2219
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:13.263
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the solution is maybe a little </v>

2220
01:46:14.921 --> 01:46:16.480
<v Speaker 4>bit of corn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of barley,</v>

2221
01:46:16.481 --> 01:46:18.400
<v Speaker 4>but mostly grassfed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2222
01:46:18.610 --> 01:46:21.310
<v Speaker 4>a brief finish and like quality grains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

2223
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:24.750
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a whole other point I'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to raise giant feedlot.</v>

2224
01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I like to sell beef,</v>

2225
01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:27.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my restaurant that comes from very </v>

2226
01:46:29.961 --> 01:46:31.160
<v Speaker 3>close to my restaurant,</v>

2227
01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.150
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2228
01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.840
<v Speaker 4>When we opened joe beef at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>

2229
01:46:34.841 --> 01:46:36.880
<v Speaker 4>when that first book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first book was written,</v>

2230
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:40.840
<v Speaker 3>a beef was a problem back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2231
01:46:40.841 --> 01:46:43.510
<v Speaker 3>local beef was kind of difficult and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2232
01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:48.070
<v Speaker 3>we were buying beef from larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>wholesalers and we,</v>

2233
01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't how to read the barcodes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boxes,</v>

2234
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:55.160
<v Speaker 3>they would say it was Canadian beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might not be safe.</v>

2235
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.093
<v Speaker 3>It might be north northern USA beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know because only a </v>

2236
01:47:00.661 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 3>professional could read the Barcode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they were saying it was Canadian.</v>

2237
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 3>But one day I had a professional come </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the restaurant and he said,</v>

2238
01:47:06.481 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually this beef is.</v>

2239
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:08.604
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a company with investiture is in </v>

2240
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is from Western Australia and I</v>

2241
01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:15.534
<v Speaker 3>said I don't want to serve anything in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my restaurant from Western Australia </v>

2242
01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:25.280
<v Speaker 3>that's super far removed from the menu </v>
<v Speaker 3>or seek alternatives.</v>

2243
01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:29.013
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a business that's complex </v>

2244
01:47:30.691 --> 01:47:35.691
<v Speaker 3>because there's past years in feed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots slaughterhouse and packers.</v>

2245
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like we have lambs,</v>

2246
01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 3>get a baby lamb that come from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents lamb and then they farm,</v>

2247
01:47:45.061 --> 01:47:45.894
<v Speaker 3>they raised the lamb and they bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the slaughterhouse themselves and </v>

2248
01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 3>then we get a lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beef is like,</v>

2249
01:47:49.710 --> 01:47:51.750
<v Speaker 3>you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like tracing bourbons,</v>

2250
01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:52.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like trading and brokerage and </v>

2251
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:56.064
<v Speaker 3>stuff and we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most sketchy item on a </v>

2252
01:47:58.081 --> 01:47:58.914
<v Speaker 3>restaurant menu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know that I bought land from you </v>

2253
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:02.303
<v Speaker 3>and I know I bought rabbit from Beatrice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know I got goat cheese from this </v>

2254
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 3>family and all of the products in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

2255
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:14.301
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly the farm and the farmer </v>
<v Speaker 3>beef is always dicey because beef always</v>

2256
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:20.080
<v Speaker 3>goes to the packer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be followers,</v>

2257
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:20.933
<v Speaker 3>goes to the distributor you fall to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the general public only really eats </v>

2258
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:28.290
<v Speaker 3>two cuts of beef in restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2259
01:48:28.291 --> 01:48:29.700
<v Speaker 3>three cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tenderloin,</v>

2260
01:48:29.710 --> 01:48:30.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2261
01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:31.083
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2262
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.790
<v Speaker 3>what do you call it in English though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll throw a coat,</v>

2263
01:48:33.110 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 3>you know the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2264
01:48:35.581 --> 01:48:37.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what people lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the hamburgers,</v>

2265
01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.850
<v Speaker 3>beefs or not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2266
01:48:38.851 --> 01:48:39.684
<v Speaker 3>there's two big humps and there's two </v>
<v Speaker 3>big shoulders and there's a lot of </v>

2267
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.984
<v Speaker 3>braids.</v>

2268
01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2269
01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:45.913
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to see that documentary </v>

2270
01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 2>on steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2271
01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.290
<v Speaker 2>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:48:51.710 --> 01:48:52.543
<v Speaker 2>You were in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2273
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:53.743
<v Speaker 2>What did you think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their conclusions and what was the </v>

2274
01:48:56.901 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 2>conclusion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2275
01:48:58.441 --> 01:48:59.274
<v Speaker 2>it just basically we're saying to Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Luger's steakhouse in Brooklyn's a </v>

2276
01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:06.490
<v Speaker 2>greatest stake in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Usda prime corn fed for taste.</v>

2277
01:49:06.970 --> 01:49:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good restaurant.</v>

2278
01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Good story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good history,</v>

2279
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:13.870
<v Speaker 2>great restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are just a few months ago.</v>

2280
01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.661
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:49:14.661 --> 01:49:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.640
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2283
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:19.100
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a subjective thing,</v>

2284
01:49:19.101 --> 01:49:19.934
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flavor in terms of like what you </v>

2285
01:49:22.221 --> 01:49:25.390
<v Speaker 2>actually look for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they as they were talking about like</v>

2286
01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:28.580
<v Speaker 2>your customers saying they're accustomed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a certain type of meat.</v>

2287
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Like they were saying that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>customers are accustomed to this,</v>

2288
01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.270
<v Speaker 2>they're not interested in grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything bad.</v>

2289
01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2290
01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.253
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing that for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grading that beef that way and I </v>

2291
01:49:38.031 --> 01:49:40.550
<v Speaker 2>don't think they should change ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not based on anything.</v>

2292
01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:41.413
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great place where you get </v>

2293
01:49:42.081 --> 01:49:43.040
<v Speaker 2>consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2294
01:49:43.041 --> 01:49:44.840
<v Speaker 2>you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this fantastic steak.</v>

2295
01:49:44.841 --> 01:49:47.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's so old world too and you get</v>

2296
01:49:47.711 --> 01:49:48.401
<v Speaker 2>in there that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2297
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 2>how long has Peter Luger's been around </v>
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

2298
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:50.690
<v Speaker 4>God?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forever.</v>

2299
01:49:50.690 --> 01:49:51.523
<v Speaker 4>Forever hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty years or something insane like </v>

2300
01:49:54.561 --> 01:49:55.740
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they get the money.</v>

2301
01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:56.593
<v Speaker 4>Shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At my trial is very old steak </v>

2302
01:49:57.561 --> 01:49:58.394
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moishe's is a famous restaurant in </v>

2303
01:50:00.051 --> 01:50:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Montreal and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2304
01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:02.233
<v Speaker 4>they do have their beef program and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>should not change because there's new </v>

2305
01:50:04.671 --> 01:50:07.280
<v Speaker 4>conversations happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what he's doing.</v>

2306
01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Lenny lighter and he should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2307
01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.320
<v Speaker 4>keep on doing that in a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>

2308
01:50:12.321 --> 01:50:15.770
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that fred marginal characters </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Fred and I own,</v>

2309
01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:21.700
<v Speaker 4>I always see it like it's not a those </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants maybe or public places.</v>

2310
01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:28.460
<v Speaker 4>My restaurant is my restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I want to do what I want in.</v>

2311
01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:29.693
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2312
01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 4>it's not at the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2313
01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 4>we don't listen so much to the public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2314
01:50:35.351 --> 01:50:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2315
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:39.700
<v Speaker 4>I serve at my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not the customer.</v>

2316
01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:40.553
<v Speaker 4>The customer is always right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the customers often wrong and I'm </v>

2317
01:50:42.141 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 4>always right because we can do salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I play the music,</v>

2318
01:50:45.151 --> 01:50:49.370
<v Speaker 4>I want to serve the food we want to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I served the wines we want to and if you</v>

2319
01:50:49.371 --> 01:50:50.600
<v Speaker 4>don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to come.</v>

2320
01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:53.150
<v Speaker 4>It's our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's this restaurant is for us.</v>

2321
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:54.163
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that I learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>from watching Bourdain's original show </v>

2322
01:50:57.111 --> 01:50:57.944
<v Speaker 2>that no reservation show and that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my opinion on things because I </v>

2323
01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:03.530
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a strong opinion on food </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>

2324
01:51:03.531 --> 01:51:04.364
<v Speaker 2>Other than that I really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it as an art form and </v>

2325
01:51:08.781 --> 01:51:12.320
<v Speaker 2>watching his show and seeing the passion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his,</v>

2326
01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:13.213
<v Speaker 2>his appreciation for food and for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way it's the way it's grown and brought </v>

2327
01:51:18.531 --> 01:51:23.000
<v Speaker 2>to the table and the production of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then ultimately the flavor of it and</v>

2328
01:51:23.001 --> 01:51:23.834
<v Speaker 2>the taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2329
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>and his admiration for chefs and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys as well,</v>

2330
01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:29.980
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his advert,</v>

2331
01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:30.853
<v Speaker 2>his admiration for it and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his appreciation for the way </v>

2332
01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:35.870
<v Speaker 2>everything's put together made me </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

2333
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:37.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an art form.</v>

2334
01:51:37.450 --> 01:51:38.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a craft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2335
01:51:38.381 --> 01:51:40.030
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony did something.</v>

2336
01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Tony was the most faithful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most like we were so lucky to be on that</v>

2337
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:45.970
<v Speaker 4>ship with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2338
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.133
<v Speaker 4>that he took us a board and you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>see he had the same apprenticeship we </v>

2339
01:51:51.461 --> 01:51:52.294
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2340
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:55.300
<v Speaker 4>like suffering and like big bistro </v>
<v Speaker 4>stroke kitchens and stuff.</v>

2341
01:51:55.301 --> 01:51:58.060
<v Speaker 4>And you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

2342
01:51:58.630 --> 01:51:59.463
<v Speaker 4>he didn't make the promise to himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when he'd get rich and famous he </v>

2343
01:52:02.321 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 4>was going to buy a big house and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to people.</v>

2344
01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:10.440
<v Speaker 4>He helped every cook not walk out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kitchen and get famous but get a voice,</v>

2345
01:52:11.610 --> 01:52:13.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>television show.</v>

2346
01:52:13.481 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 4>The work he did in private is not look </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a dirty guy that makes the pasta in</v>

2347
01:52:18.011 --> 01:52:18.671
<v Speaker 4>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2348
01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2349
01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.000
<v Speaker 4>the manager in the suit and the owners.</v>

2350
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.490
<v Speaker 4>But who's the guy in the back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had appreciation for everybody and he</v>

2351
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:30.440
<v Speaker 4>had a real passion for the process and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the marginal character is like,</v>

2352
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:31.683
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of commercial restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the city of Montreal in any given </v>

2353
01:52:34.601 --> 01:52:38.410
<v Speaker 4>city of that he went to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was able to isolate,</v>

2354
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.273
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the marginal characters in every city </v>

2355
01:52:41.831 --> 01:52:43.330
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2356
01:52:43.331 --> 01:52:45.020
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2357
01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:50.160
<v Speaker 4>we're historically bound kind of Fred </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I practice a weird faction of French</v>

2358
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:54.830
<v Speaker 4>cooking called cuisine bourgeoise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>only kind of Tony and a handful of other</v>

2359
01:52:54.831 --> 01:52:57.710
<v Speaker 4>guys couldn't look at what we do and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2360
01:52:57.711 --> 01:52:59.020
<v Speaker 4>those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2361
01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:01.420
<v Speaker 4>they're up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

2362
01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:05.050
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are the only people,</v>

2363
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 4>the last of the Mohicans that do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of food.</v>

2364
01:53:08.150 --> 01:53:08.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2365
01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know we can't stop.</v>

2366
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 4>We got to keep on with what a great guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get it to.</v>

2367
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because nobody does,</v>

2368
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.400
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody understands.</v>

2369
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:20.360
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the rabbit hole where down Tony</v>

2370
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:21.194
<v Speaker 4>did the.</v>

2371
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2372
01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:24.933
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2373
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000
<v Speaker 2>he really did a deeply influenced my </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for food in the way I think</v>

2374
01:53:30.111 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2375
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:34.243
<v Speaker 2>treating it as an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just thought it was just </v>

2376
01:53:35.751 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it as like,</v>

2377
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are making temporary art.</v>

2378
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 2>They're making art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

2379
01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you're going to enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know you're,</v>

2380
01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:44.041
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2381
01:53:44.041 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't put it on film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can,</v>

2382
01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:47.563
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to get it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just gonna want to go out and </v>

2383
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:49.904
<v Speaker 2>experience it.</v>

2384
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:50.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately food is you can't we go and </v>

2385
01:53:52.611 --> 01:53:55.610
<v Speaker 4>do like we were asked to do like </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrations,</v>

2386
01:53:55.611 --> 01:53:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go on a big stage.</v>

2387
01:53:57.151 --> 01:53:57.984
<v Speaker 4>It's 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to talk about food or make like </v>

2388
01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 4>little crackers with smoked salmon </v>
<v Speaker 4>onstage.</v>

2389
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Food is not fit for a stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2390
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:07.360
<v Speaker 4>Food is for a table for us to enjoy it </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a fork and knife.</v>

2391
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:10.130
<v Speaker 4>We talk about it and go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what food is.</v>

2392
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 4>Paypal offers food shows all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't work.</v>

2393
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 4>What's the concept?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2394
01:54:15.441 --> 01:54:16.274
<v Speaker 4>you guys can be in a pickup truck and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you go and visit your suppliers and </v>

2395
01:54:19.101 --> 01:54:20.930
<v Speaker 4>maybe I have a bottle of wine with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>after.</v>

2396
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2397
01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:27.580
<v Speaker 4>like we worked hard not to copy or </v>
<v Speaker 4>fellow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>culinarians.</v>

2399
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:31.303
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at TV producers are out there </v>

2400
01:54:33.771 --> 01:54:38.771
<v Speaker 4>just like blatantly proposing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>previous show to you again.</v>

2401
01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:40.443
<v Speaker 4>Well that's one of the things</v>

2402
01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.260
<v Speaker 2>right after anthony died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some talk about,</v>

2403
01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:45.360
<v Speaker 4>oh</v>

2404
01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Hugh Ramsay doing some very similar show</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the outcry against it was enormous.</v>

2405
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just getting assaulted </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

2406
01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was crazy</v>

2407
01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:56.483
<v Speaker 4>that everybody that I was talking to our</v>
<v Speaker 4>agents who represents us for our book </v>

2408
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.740
<v Speaker 4>and she was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the same.</v>

2409
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:05.893
<v Speaker 4>All the big production companies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being paraded by people pitching who is </v>

2410
01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:15.690
<v Speaker 4>going to be the next Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2411
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:17.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say that,</v>

2412
01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 4>but one of the character and you guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could take over.</v>

2413
01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do it because you guys track,</v>

2414
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:25.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it went in West Virginia and it </v>

2415
01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:30.410
<v Speaker 4>wasn't like Republican or Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he went to places.</v>

2416
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:32.660
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah sure I have my views,</v>

2417
01:55:32.661 --> 01:55:34.430
<v Speaker 4>but let's break bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

2418
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:38.780
<v Speaker 4>And I always said that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all our countries are divided on issues,</v>

2419
01:55:38.781 --> 01:55:43.290
<v Speaker 4>but they're nobody that overlaps them </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a coherent vision.</v>

2420
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Everybody</v>

2421
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 2>loves each other when there's delicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>food on the table that and guys like you</v>

2422
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:49.223
<v Speaker 2>with like a clear view and irrational </v>
<v Speaker 2>and science based and evidence based </v>

2423
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.520
<v Speaker 2>view on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like Tony just have such a voice now</v>

2424
01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:02.820
<v Speaker 2>in our countries that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see you doing a food show.</v>

2425
01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I love food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

2426
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:06.953
<v Speaker 2>I'll never do a food show and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't imagine not because you ask </v>

2427
01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:12.990
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like doing show.</v>

2428
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love having guys like you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about food,</v>

2429
01:56:16.051 --> 01:56:21.051
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a special type of person to</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to travel 300 days a year,</v>

2430
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's essentially what Tony was </v>

2431
01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:26.940
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that has a massive toll.</v>

2432
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2433
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:28.723
<v Speaker 2>it takes a massive toll on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a massive toll on your psyche </v>

2434
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 2>family everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not healthy.</v>

2435
01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.233
<v Speaker 2>I know there's not enough Melatonin or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cbd or the lenses to help you with </v>

2436
01:56:42.571 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2437
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I traveled more than enough already and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've cut my traveling way back.</v>

2438
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm down to only 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC is a year now,</v>

2439
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:50.660
<v Speaker 2>and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:53.770
<v Speaker 2>comedy around that and stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2441
01:56:53.771 --> 01:56:54.604
<v Speaker 2>I consciously make the effort to travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>much less because I just don't think </v>

2442
01:56:58.591 --> 01:57:00.510
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's good for you.</v>

2443
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also that road life,</v>

2444
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:05.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2445
01:57:05.191 --> 01:57:06.024
<v Speaker 2>the drinking and all that other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes with it that accentuates all </v>

2446
01:57:08.431 --> 01:57:09.840
<v Speaker 2>the problems that you have with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2447
01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.693
<v Speaker 2>with travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's also one of the </v>

2448
01:57:12.391 --> 01:57:13.330
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2449
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:14.623
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was dragging tony down when he would </v>

2450
01:57:16.201 --> 01:57:19.830
<v Speaker 2>talk about the sadness and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness of being on the road.</v>

2451
01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but from knowing him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>partying with him,</v>

2452
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:24.593
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but the thought that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that was probably accentuated by the </v>

2453
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:28.464
<v Speaker 2>alcohol consumption and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you guys could speak to that now </v>

2454
01:57:31.861 --> 01:57:32.694
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2455
01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 2>you're clean and you're not experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2456
01:57:35.070 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 2>those rugged hangovers every morning.</v>

2457
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always worried for Tony that way.</v>

2458
01:57:38.911 --> 01:57:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hotel,</v>

2459
01:57:41.491 --> 01:57:45.540
<v Speaker 2>living planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trains and automobiles constantly and it</v>

2460
01:57:45.541 --> 01:57:47.360
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like for a year it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2461
01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:48.463
<v Speaker 2>well years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad life if the watch river monsters at </v>

2462
01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:52.283
<v Speaker 2>11 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burping Jamison and I'm referring to </v>

2463
01:57:55.051 --> 01:58:00.051
<v Speaker 2>many occasions in our life where like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're traveling in a hotel room and you</v>

2464
01:58:00.730 --> 01:58:03.160
<v Speaker 2>were in a beautiful place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like just,</v>

2465
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:05.820
<v Speaker 2>you feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2466
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.793
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken steps to mitigate some of </v>

2467
01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:08.874
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big ones is I travel with </v>

2468
01:58:09.841 --> 01:58:10.674
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bring really good comics to work </v>

2469
01:58:13.141 --> 01:58:15.840
<v Speaker 2>with me on the road so that when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these cities,</v>

2470
01:58:15.841 --> 01:58:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm in these cities with friends and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just go.</v>

2471
01:58:17.671 --> 01:58:19.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go,</v>

2472
01:58:19.831 --> 01:58:22.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll go eat together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go work out together,</v>

2473
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:23.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to keep the unhealthy shit to a </v>

2474
01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:25.704
<v Speaker 2>minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus I'm more of a marijuana </v>

2475
01:58:27.091 --> 01:58:29.160
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic than I am a drinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

2476
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:32.280
<v Speaker 2>It's legal and back now we stores in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire country,</v>

2477
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Canada as well in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're connected as usual.</v>

2478
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:37.650
<v Speaker 2>We got a little bit the special </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>

2479
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:39.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're everywhere else in French.</v>

2480
01:58:39.930 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Then on top of yet you</v>

2481
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.720
<v Speaker 4>can't grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it,</v>

2482
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:46.210
<v Speaker 4>in cannabis?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cannabis.</v>

2483
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 4>You can't grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't grow,</v>

2484
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:53.410
<v Speaker 4>and you have to only consume the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government's going grow anyway.</v>

2485
01:58:53.411 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not worried about that government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know what they did,</v>

2486
01:58:56.081 --> 01:58:56.561
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2487
01:58:56.561 --> 01:58:57.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2488
01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:58.163
<v Speaker 4>we have a monopoly liquor board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have like storage or commissioner </v>

2489
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:04.510
<v Speaker 4>commissioner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we have the cannabis commission.</v>

2490
01:59:04.511 --> 01:59:05.344
<v Speaker 4>So what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it got legal and October 17th at </v>

2491
01:59:07.811 --> 01:59:11.570
<v Speaker 4>midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stores we're opening October 17th at</v>

2492
01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.433
<v Speaker 4>10 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cops were giving tickets to people </v>

2493
01:59:14.921 --> 01:59:15.754
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed during that little layover </v>
<v Speaker 4>time because they knew that it was </v>

2494
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:22.210
<v Speaker 4>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They bought it legally.</v>

2495
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.330
<v Speaker 4>So some people get ticketed for smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Illegal.</v>

2496
01:59:25.331 --> 01:59:29.110
<v Speaker 4>We'd align it for legal weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2497
01:59:29.111 --> 01:59:30.390
<v Speaker 4>What a bunch of asks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2498
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 4>we just drank the Koolaid on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you know,</v>

2499
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:36.250
<v Speaker 4>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll put more money into Medicare.</v>

2500
01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:37.423
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

2501
01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:38.603
<v Speaker 2>ultimately lead to relaxing of people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions and ideas about marijuana and </v>

2502
01:59:41.971 --> 01:59:44.940
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that marijuana,</v>

2503
01:59:44.941 --> 01:59:45.774
<v Speaker 2>just like alcohol can be used as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crutch and it could eventually overcome </v>

2504
01:59:48.961 --> 01:59:50.340
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it,</v>

2505
01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:51.540
<v Speaker 2>but I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2506
01:59:51.541 --> 01:59:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every now and again,</v>

2507
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:53.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that came out of </v>

2508
01:59:55.171 --> 01:59:56.004
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober October was taking a whole month </v>

2509
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:59.910
<v Speaker 2>off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that hey,</v>

2510
01:59:59.911 --> 02:00:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

2511
02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.393
<v Speaker 2>I can function fine without it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it made me more apprehensive about </v>

2512
02:00:06.451 --> 02:00:09.510
<v Speaker 2>regular use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of using it every day,</v>

2513
02:00:09.511 --> 02:00:10.344
<v Speaker 2>I'll use it a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week or two days a week or something </v>

2514
02:00:11.911 --> 02:00:12.744
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2515
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:14.730
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate it more when it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

2516
02:00:14.731 --> 02:00:15.564
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do get high with my friends on </v>

2517

<v Speaker 5>they went in and chip some parts out.</v>

2631
02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:40.553
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

2632
02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:42.653
<v Speaker 5>in retrospect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I spoke to some rheumatologists and </v>

2633
02:05:44.791 --> 02:05:46.230
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2634
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:47.064
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan Peterson because the auto immune </v>

2635
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:52.090
<v Speaker 5>thing can be everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2636
02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:53.213
<v Speaker 5>And now the doctor says like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>Celiac caused the inflammation and so </v>

2637
02:05:56.821 --> 02:05:58.950
<v Speaker 5>many places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I would say and all that,</v>

2638
02:05:58.970 --> 02:06:03.180
<v Speaker 5>like maybe the drinking to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>inclination towards abuse,</v>

2639
02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:05.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this inclination towards depression,</v>

2640
02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:08.640
<v Speaker 5>this back problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2641
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:10.920
<v Speaker 5>it's all related to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

2642
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:13.380
<v Speaker 5>the proof is in the pudding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't eat bread,</v>

2643
02:06:13.381 --> 02:06:14.214
<v Speaker 5>I don't eat sweets very little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mostly meet and I feel 100 times </v>

2644
02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:20.004
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck if fits in my head </v>

2645
02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:25.140
<v Speaker 5>for sober now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four months,</v>

2646
02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 5>five months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2647
02:06:26.761 --> 02:06:29.970
<v Speaker 5>so it works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that it's in your head,</v>

2648
02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:34.380
<v Speaker 5>but it's definitely been proven that all</v>
<v Speaker 5>those foods cause inflammation.</v>

2649
02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:35.513
<v Speaker 5>But I do think that Jujitsu in </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular is ruthless on your back </v>

2650
02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:40.170
<v Speaker 5>because of the torsions.</v>

2651
02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2652
02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big people on top of you.</v>

2653
02:06:42.881 --> 02:06:44.760
<v Speaker 5>You're yanking them around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're moving it back.</v>

2654
02:06:44.761 --> 02:06:47.700
<v Speaker 5>And very and very few people strengthen </v>
<v Speaker 5>their back.</v>

2655
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:49.050
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big issue.</v>

2656
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:49.884
<v Speaker 5>And after we're done here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take you into my gym and </v>

2657
02:06:51.161 --> 02:06:51.994
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to show you some machines that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought specifically to strengthen my </v>

2658
02:06:54.571 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had some disc issues too,</v>

2659
02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:01.140
<v Speaker 5>and the doctors are pretty adamant about</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting me under the knife.</v>

2660
02:07:01.410 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2661
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:04.890
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't like the idea of it.</v>

2662
02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:07.800
<v Speaker 5>I've had many surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had both my knees reconstructed.</v>

2663
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 5>I know when you need surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you don't.</v>

2664
02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:11.483
<v Speaker 5>And the more I looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more I realize that there's doctors </v>

2665
02:07:14.761 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 5>that they have a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So everything's a nail that's a nail.</v>

2666
02:07:18.871 --> 02:07:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Let me just fucking whack that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not like,</v>

2667
02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:21.893
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to change your </v>

2668
02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:23.484
<v Speaker 5>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to lose some </v>

2669
02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 5>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to strengthen those</v>

2670
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:29.520
<v Speaker 5>muscles around your back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you do do that,</v>

2671
02:07:29.521 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 5>I find that the results are superior in </v>
<v Speaker 5>many cases.</v>

2672
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 5>It's a combination like yoga works </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderfully for testing.</v>

2673
02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decompression of the spine is,</v>

2674
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:40.770
<v Speaker 2>is critical because you're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>compressing.</v>

2675
02:07:40.771 --> 02:07:41.311
<v Speaker 2>You always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2676
02:07:41.311 --> 02:07:42.144
<v Speaker 2>these chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting in these chairs from a </v>

2677
02:07:44.061 --> 02:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>company called fully and they're called </v>
<v Speaker 2>capisce co's.</v>

2678
02:07:47.070 --> 02:07:48.730
<v Speaker 2>And these are Ergonomic chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2679
02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.573
<v Speaker 2>as we've been sitting in this place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two and a half hours in the </v>

2680
02:07:51.211 --> 02:07:52.320
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't,</v>

2681
02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:55.800
<v Speaker 2>our backs aren't hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel good too.</v>

2682
02:07:56.010 --> 02:07:56.843
<v Speaker 2>They're comfortable as like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew there was a solution how to </v>

2683
02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:01.080
<v Speaker 2>find the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily this,</v>

2684
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:03.900
<v Speaker 2>this company contacted me and sent us </v>
<v Speaker 2>these chairs.</v>

2685
02:08:03.930 --> 02:08:04.763
<v Speaker 2>This is what we needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to fucking shitload of chairs </v>

2686
02:08:06.301 --> 02:08:07.134
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was the same thing with the </v>

2687
02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:10.170
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew there was a solution.</v>

2688
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried decompression.</v>

2689
02:08:12.901 --> 02:08:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I tried a bunch of different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>decompression.</v>

2690
02:08:15.241 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I figured out the best ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2691
02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I have those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2692
02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:22.430
<v Speaker 2>those things are the way you hang by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ankle.</v>

2693
02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:26.220
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is the name of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

2694
02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Hooks known the upside down thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

2695
02:08:29.971 --> 02:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>They're a sponsor of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex swings.</v>

2696
02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Teeter totter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teeter makes those like,</v>

2697
02:08:34.291 --> 02:08:36.570
<v Speaker 2>just relaxing in those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have one back there.</v>

2698
02:08:36.571 --> 02:08:39.720
<v Speaker 2>You clamp your ankles in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just collect that back.</v>

2699
02:08:39.721 --> 02:08:40.554
<v Speaker 2>Just stretch out again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a bunch of different </v>

2700
02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:45.210
<v Speaker 2>exercise that I do with yoga this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretcher back out as well.</v>

2701
02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:47.340
<v Speaker 2>We're in a constant state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>compression,</v>

2702
02:08:47.341 --> 02:08:48.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constant gravity,</v>

2703
02:08:49.110 --> 02:08:51.180
<v Speaker 2>constant pushing you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a guy like me,</v>

2704
02:08:51.181 --> 02:08:56.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm always lifting weights to some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got these heavy is pushing up and</v>

2705
02:08:56.970 --> 02:08:59.130
<v Speaker 2>got up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to spend as much time.</v>

2706
02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:01.590
<v Speaker 2>But we'll lengthening as you do pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2707
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>And you also have to stretch everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>out because the more your hamstrings are</v>

2708
02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to pull down on your back.</v>

2709
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:11.850
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that have back pains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a connected feet.</v>

2710
02:09:11.851 --> 02:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Dangling tight hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2711
02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I have a theory through the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of things starts in school,</v>

2712
02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:20.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you look at kids.</v>

2713
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 4>I have two boys and one daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know Henry,</v>

2714
02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Ivan and Eleanor and they five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

2715
02:09:26.651 --> 02:09:28.330
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can do monkey bars,</v>

2716
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:29.680
<v Speaker 4>pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscle ups,</v>

2717
02:09:29.770 --> 02:09:31.990
<v Speaker 4>you know like they do judo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they play hockey.</v>

2718
02:09:31.991 --> 02:09:34.540
<v Speaker 4>They're very active.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But school,</v>

2719
02:09:34.930 --> 02:09:38.950
<v Speaker 4>the way that physically a classroom is </v>
<v Speaker 4>designed is wrong.</v>

2720
02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:40.233
<v Speaker 4>It's like putting them in a cast for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next 15 years and then they're going to </v>

2721
02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:46.120
<v Speaker 4>come out of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was unable to climb a rope.</v>

2722
02:09:46.150 --> 02:09:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm able to do monkey bars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unable to do anything right.</v>

2723
02:09:49.391 --> 02:09:52.810
<v Speaker 4>And then they're going to go through </v>
<v Speaker 4>more school and sit down for more times,</v>

2724
02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:53.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they don't get enough physical </v>

2725
02:09:54.581 --> 02:09:56.310
<v Speaker 4>activity and not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2726
02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:59.800
<v Speaker 4>not even the education towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even the education nutricia yeah.</v>

2727
02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 4>And they get graded and evaluated on how</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they listened in gym class,</v>

2728
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:07.420
<v Speaker 4>which is completely insane.</v>

2729
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

2730
02:10:08.511 --> 02:10:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just making them sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all that time during the day.</v>

2731
02:10:13.311 --> 02:10:14.144
<v Speaker 2>We're just preparing them for some job </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a natural in the </v>

2732
02:10:15.921 --> 02:10:16.754
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

2733
02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Good little taxpayers and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it too.</v>

2734
02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:24.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a model of school that was based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on like religious schools,</v>

2735
02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:25.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2736
02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:28.080
<v Speaker 4>and like old Catholic schools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say in Quebec.</v>

2737
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.860
<v Speaker 4>How did you keep them from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>distracted?</v>

2738
02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:33.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ruler,</v>

2739
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.033
<v Speaker 4>the fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to the corner of the leather </v>

2740
02:10:35.121 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 4>strap now we haven't changed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>classroom,</v>

2741
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:42.600
<v Speaker 4>the schedule and the curriculum barely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no more straps,</v>

2742
02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:43.310
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2743
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:44.143
<v Speaker 4>we haven't changed anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's normal that it particularly </v>

2744
02:10:47.391 --> 02:10:50.270
<v Speaker 4>little boys don't listen in school that </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2745
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:55.160
<v Speaker 4>We have to find a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to redesign school from like the</v>

2746
02:10:55.161 --> 02:10:57.020
<v Speaker 4>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the design of the classroom,</v>

2747
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:58.670
<v Speaker 4>the hallways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the introduction,</v>

2748
02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we have to bring restaurants back </v>

2749
02:11:01.941 --> 02:11:04.290
<v Speaker 4>into school cafeteria and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2750
02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.133
<v Speaker 4>it like cafeteria is and I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's you the talk with Jeff Bridges </v>

2751
02:11:08.511 --> 02:11:09.344
<v Speaker 4>about that because he's in the school </v>
<v Speaker 4>lunches thing and the problem with </v>

2752
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:12.704
<v Speaker 4>school lunches is that if you subsidize </v>
<v Speaker 4>half the kids then you have a kid with </v>

2753
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:19.760
<v Speaker 4>like a badge here that says like poor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2754
02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:25.420
<v Speaker 4>So the only way to do that then I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are a bit anti socialist,</v>

2755
02:11:25.521 --> 02:11:27.340
<v Speaker 4>but you have to feed all the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2756
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 4>It's crucial.</v>

2757
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jesus Christ,</v>

2758
02:11:31.361 --> 02:11:32.194
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about food and also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of community that's established </v>

2759
02:11:35.111 --> 02:11:36.670
<v Speaker 2>when everybody eats together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna,</v>

2760
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:37.743
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna create this rift between </v>

2761
02:11:40.210 --> 02:11:44.620
<v Speaker 2>students where you establish that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>student is poor than the other ones just</v>

2762
02:11:44.621 --> 02:11:47.410
<v Speaker 2>going to fuck them up already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's going to already make them</v>

2763
02:11:47.411 --> 02:11:48.240
<v Speaker 2>insecure</v>

2764
02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:51.000
<v Speaker 4>unless you have the labor force with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

2765
02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:53.130
<v Speaker 4>like not to say that we're gonna make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids work,</v>

2766
02:11:53.131 --> 02:11:56.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's to be a learning experience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can take their turns.</v>

2767
02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Preparing family meals inside of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>school system is a valuable tool</v>

2768
02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:04.390
<v Speaker 2>tool and if it was done and handled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and appreciation,</v>

2769
02:12:04.391 --> 02:12:08.320
<v Speaker 2>if they have classes perhaps that showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>how important food is,</v>

2770
02:12:08.530 --> 02:12:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe even show an episode of no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reservations or you know,</v>

2771
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:12.743
<v Speaker 2>or parts unknown and show how people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate food and what food really is </v>

2772
02:12:18.191 --> 02:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>and how great it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2773
02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:24.790
<v Speaker 2>and also it would open their eyes to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of food as a career of,</v>

2774
02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:25.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting into the same position that </v>

2775
02:12:26.981 --> 02:12:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you guys are in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2776
02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:30.520
<v Speaker 2>this is something that's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>

2777
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:31.363
<v Speaker 2>Mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time a kid was </v>

2778
02:12:32.021 --> 02:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to become a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2779
02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:36.520
<v Speaker 2>is a standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2780
02:12:36.521 --> 02:12:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you never get encouraged to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

2781
02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>they just call you a fuck up and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put you on drugs.</v>

2782
02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:44.420
<v Speaker 4>It never comes out when they do a survey</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2783
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:45.263
<v Speaker 4>90 percent of our labor force inside the</v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants is you could anybody who </v>

2784
02:12:48.511 --> 02:12:49.344
<v Speaker 4>cooks inside the restaurants is someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who didn't work inside the traditional </v>

2785
02:12:54.541 --> 02:12:55.740
<v Speaker 4>school system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2786
02:12:55.741 --> 02:12:58.230
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we employ a dropouts.</v>

2787
02:12:58.400 --> 02:12:59.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:12:59.250 --> 02:13:01.020
<v Speaker 4>But brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2789
02:13:01.021 --> 02:13:03.150
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's brilliant people on the team.</v>

2790
02:13:03.151 --> 02:13:06.360
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the school system did not work for them.</v>

2791
02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the same thing with both of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my jobs,</v>

2792
02:13:09.211 --> 02:13:12.000
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the UFC or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy.</v>

2793
02:13:12.330 --> 02:13:13.163
<v Speaker 2>Everyone that I'm close with is a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the traditional sense like we </v>

2794
02:13:17.281 --> 02:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us fit in.</v>

2795
02:13:18.641 --> 02:13:19.474
<v Speaker 2>It's very few people that get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy that were thriving and </v>

2796
02:13:22.591 --> 02:13:23.424
<v Speaker 2>some other career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us were extremely frustrated </v>

2797
02:13:26.251 --> 02:13:27.084
<v Speaker 2>with traditional environments and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us didn't do well in school because </v>

2798
02:13:30.541 --> 02:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>we felt and just couldn't wait to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightmares about going back to school.</v>

2799
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you have add as a child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I got it all,</v>

2800
02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:38.813
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that gives you energy </v>

2801
02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that makes you better at stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got that.</v>

2802
02:13:44.050 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 2>They'll call it a bad thing and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2803
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't concentrate while I'm fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>bored.</v>

2804
02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.613
<v Speaker 2>Give them knocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated me something that I can </v>

2805
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me something that I actually enjoy.</v>

2806
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:55.613
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that there's something wrong </v>

2807
02:13:57.961 --> 02:13:58.794
<v Speaker 2>with me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no interest and what they're </v>

2808
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:01.764
<v Speaker 2>selling and it's being sold by some </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpaid under motivated person who </v>

2809
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:06.713
<v Speaker 2>really is just following some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum and they have to do that </v>

2810
02:14:08.761 --> 02:14:12.480
<v Speaker 2>because they want to keep their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what kids are being subjected to</v>

2811
02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:13.314
<v Speaker 2>all across the world in the most fertile</v>
<v Speaker 2>time of their life in terms of their </v>

2812
02:14:17.851 --> 02:14:20.970
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their creativity and their free time.</v>

2813
02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:22.043
<v Speaker 2>Frontal cortex is a sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're ready to take everything and no </v>

2814
02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:28.374
<v Speaker 2>one would ever say to some kid who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cracking jokes in class and running </v>

2815
02:14:32.611 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 2>around being a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one would ever say,</v>

2816
02:14:34.381 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever thought about being a comedian?</v>

2817
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one says that.</v>

2818
02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Just never comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile everybody loves comedians.</v>

2819
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:43.403
<v Speaker 2>People love to go see comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody ever says to some fuck up </v>

2820
02:14:45.901 --> 02:14:47.190
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2821
02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.620
<v Speaker 2>you might be a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2822
02:14:49.621 --> 02:14:51.060
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't come up.</v>

2823
02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.473
<v Speaker 4>They will do the test and like David was</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be a travel agent was I was </v>

2824
02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:58.073
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be a golf pro in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be a golf pro at a </v>

2825
02:15:02.111 --> 02:15:02.950
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2826
02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.013
<v Speaker 4>and then according to the questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of my friend who flies planes </v>

2827
02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:08.053
<v Speaker 4>was supposed think to be a folly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Artists make sounds of horses with </v>

2828
02:15:10.701 --> 02:15:12.520
<v Speaker 4>coconuts and movies like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

2830
02:15:13.290 --> 02:15:15.120
<v Speaker 4>That's what they told them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After the questionnaire,</v>

2831
02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:17.910
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck kind of questionnaire do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys have in Canada?</v>

2832
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:21.110
<v Speaker 3>The success of restaurant though you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to think though,</v>

2833
02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:26.320
<v Speaker 3>is due to a lot of very sad people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone through the academic process.</v>

2834
02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:27.913
<v Speaker 3>I have a disproportion amount of lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and professionals and people who wear </v>

2835
02:15:34.191 --> 02:15:35.024
<v Speaker 3>suits that love to come to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and drink wine and let the </v>

2836
02:15:39.351 --> 02:15:40.184
<v Speaker 3>dog stopped barking inside their heads </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're really fucking </v>

2837
02:15:43.041 --> 02:15:44.310
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2838
02:15:44.311 --> 02:15:45.144
<v Speaker 3>when you spent your whole day in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>72nd floor of the IBM tower downtown in </v>

<v Speaker 2>Arctic in the 19 seventies and he's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>there since the only thing he's ever </v>

<v Speaker 2>photographs.</v>

2918
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:08.160
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea what's happening when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2919
02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2921
02:19:11.970 --> 02:19:13.290
<v Speaker 2>but this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2922
02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:14.193
<v Speaker 2>this guy lives alone in Alaska with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife in the Arctic national refuge and </v>

2923
02:19:20.631 --> 02:19:21.464
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get in with a float plane </v>

2924
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:27.090
<v Speaker 2>and he just hunted Caribou and he lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his family.</v>

2925
02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Wife is into it and they have children </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and children leave and </v>

2926
02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.030
<v Speaker 2>eventually went on to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2927
02:19:35.031 --> 02:19:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of their kids was two years old,</v>

2928
02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:39.193
<v Speaker 2>died in a canoe accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The canoe fell over and the kid fell </v>

2929
02:19:42.351 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>into the river and they revisit the spot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time of her birthday.</v>

2930
02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:51.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this guy really believes that people</v>

2931
02:19:51.921 --> 02:19:52.754
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're happier and healthier when they </v>

2932
02:19:56.271 --> 02:20:01.271
<v Speaker 2>live a hunter gatherer lifestyle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>choleric restriction.</v>

2933
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.340
<v Speaker 2>All he does is eat Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2934
02:20:04.341 --> 02:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the guy is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2935
02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.690
<v Speaker 2>eating Caribou and during the time where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're filming this,</v>

2936
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.823
<v Speaker 2>his cabin and is caribou stash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets attacked by a grizzly bear and he </v>

2937
02:20:13.011 --> 02:20:13.844
<v Speaker 2>shoots the grizzly bear on film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chases it down to the night and </v>

2938
02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:18.613
<v Speaker 2>blasts it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the grizzly bears and eaten one </v>

2939
02:20:20.931 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>of his dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2940
02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:25.600
<v Speaker 2>this is motherfuckers out there living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>

2941
02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:27.140
<v Speaker 2>he's a very smart guy.</v>

2942
02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:30.230
<v Speaker 2>He's not what you would think when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of someone like this,</v>

2943
02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:31.064
<v Speaker 2>you think of someone who has some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of inbred halfwit who's living up </v>

2944
02:20:35.601 --> 02:20:37.160
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he's very intelligent,</v>

2945
02:20:37.161 --> 02:20:39.880
<v Speaker 2>very introvert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

2946
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.963
<v Speaker 2>maybe introverted for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem to have a hard time </v>

2947
02:20:43.011 --> 02:20:45.020
<v Speaker 2>talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if he's introverted,</v>

2948
02:20:45.350 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely restricted his,</v>

2949
02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:50.540
<v Speaker 2>his access to dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2950
02:20:50.541 --> 02:20:52.400
<v Speaker 2>he's out there alone in the forest by </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

2951
02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:53.234
<v Speaker 2>but he makes a very compelling point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a natural feeling that he </v>

2952
02:20:57.171 --> 02:21:00.150
<v Speaker 2>gets from doing this where everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls into place.</v>

2953
02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:00.984
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly getting exercise because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hiking and chasing after these </v>

2954
02:21:03.801 --> 02:21:04.634
<v Speaker 2>Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there's natural human reward </v>

2955
02:21:06.651 --> 02:21:07.484
<v Speaker 2>systems that are in place in his DNA for</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting and gathering and cooking this </v>

2956
02:21:10.611 --> 02:21:13.100
<v Speaker 2>food over an open fire and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

2957
02:21:13.101 --> 02:21:13.934
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just thinks it's the way people </v>

2958
02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.180
<v Speaker 2>really are designed to live.</v>

2959
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:22.210
<v Speaker 2>We're absolutely not meant to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>piled on top of each other within,</v>

2960
02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:23.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 million of us in a square mile and </v>

2961
02:21:26.151 --> 02:21:27.470
<v Speaker 2>the island of Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2962
02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:29.473
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when there was the </v>

2963
02:21:31.821 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 2>floods in Manhattan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2964
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:36.740
<v Speaker 2>All the money in the world couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you out.</v>

2965
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:37.993
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to walk across the Brooklyn </v>

2966
02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Bridge to leave Manhattan with everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2967
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2968
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a real worry because of </v>

2969
02:21:46.851 --> 02:21:48.650
<v Speaker 2>climate change that was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening every year.</v>

2970
02:21:48.651 --> 02:21:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>

2971
02:21:49.641 --> 02:21:50.474
<v Speaker 2>is this the new normal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember Shane Smith at some piece of </v>

2972
02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:54.710
<v Speaker 2>the walkout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2973
02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane had to walk out and.</v>

2974
02:21:55.821 --> 02:21:59.720
<v Speaker 2>But he had some piece on vice where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were detailing the inside of his,</v>

2975
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:01.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment building.</v>

2976
02:22:01.161 --> 02:22:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Like the fucking thing was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooded like six feet high and water,</v>

2977
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:06.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people were worried,</v>

2978
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:09.440
<v Speaker 2>worried like this is going to be what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening on a regular basis.</v>

2979
02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Now this climate change thing has </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

2980
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I have a heightened sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2981
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:15.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I have three kids,</v>

2982
02:22:15.351 --> 02:22:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I think about.</v>

2983
02:22:17.151 --> 02:22:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I have ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2984
02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:21.140
<v Speaker 2>I bought a generator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2985
02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I checked the batteries are rechargeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>batteries for all of the that I have.</v>

2986
02:22:25.891 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2987
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.903
<v Speaker 3>own solar panels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own the Duffel bag full of everything </v>

2988
02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:32.730
<v Speaker 3>that I need to throw in the back of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>pickup truck,</v>

2989
02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:33.564
<v Speaker 3>grabbed my kids and I know which way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive away from the city to go to the </v>

2990
02:22:36.721 --> 02:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something I've planned just because</v>

2991
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm the ward of these small humans whom </v>
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

2992
02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2993
02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:50.920
<v Speaker 4>it's funny you talked about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>restriction again and the thing just I'm</v>

2994
02:22:51.951 --> 02:22:53.800
<v Speaker 4>thinking of preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2995
02:22:53.801 --> 02:22:54.634
<v Speaker 4>and the most common thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare his food and prepare cans and </v>

2996
02:22:58.671 --> 02:22:59.504
<v Speaker 4>cans and cans of food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still they eat so much of that food </v>

2997
02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:03.733
<v Speaker 4>that the best way to prepare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best way to prepare would be to </v>

2998
02:23:07.761 --> 02:23:12.761
<v Speaker 4>start to eat less and learn how to live </v>
<v Speaker 4>at 1700 calories,</v>

2999
02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:14.173
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and learn how to live with the people </v>

3000
02:23:16.281 --> 02:23:17.114
<v Speaker 4>around you because if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>spend like two months in the bunker or </v>

3001
02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:25.210
<v Speaker 4>in a bug out location or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not some asshole to your kids and</v>

3002
02:23:26.151 --> 02:23:28.400
<v Speaker 4>your friends and family and people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3003
02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:29.910
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3004
02:23:29.911 --> 02:23:33.060
<v Speaker 2>this is really fascinating when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when disasters do strike,</v>

3005
02:23:33.061 --> 02:23:35.460
<v Speaker 2>because everyone gets a lot friendlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3006
02:23:35.461 --> 02:23:39.430
<v Speaker 2>and this is one thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced myself this week because uh,</v>

3007
02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:41.670
<v Speaker 2>when we got evacuated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 2:30</v>

3008
02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:46.440
<v Speaker 2>in the morning on Thursday and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire a rock's throw from my house.</v>

3009
02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

3010
02:23:48.361 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to hundreds of acres of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

3011
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:51.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just roaring over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started to see houses started seeing </v>

3012
02:23:54.461 --> 02:23:55.294
<v Speaker 2>the gas lines explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houses burst into flames and it was </v>

3013
02:23:58.621 --> 02:24:02.130
<v Speaker 2>right down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're seeing this and you know,</v>

3014
02:24:02.131 --> 02:24:02.851
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3015
02:24:02.851 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got outside,</v>

3016
02:24:04.111 --> 02:24:05.640
<v Speaker 2>we're in the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The neighbors come over,</v>

3017
02:24:05.641 --> 02:24:06.800
<v Speaker 2>everyone's talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

3018
02:24:06.810 --> 02:24:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting the fuck out of here.</v>

3019
02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:11.220
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they given the evacuation orders?</v>

3020
02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3021
02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:12.990
<v Speaker 2>we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I go,</v>

3022
02:24:12.991 --> 02:24:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3023
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta go.</v>

3024
02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:16.223
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it,</v>

3025
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:18.810
<v Speaker 2>if we're wrong and we come back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house is still here.</v>

3026
02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:19.673
<v Speaker 2>That's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to get out of these things </v>

3027
02:24:21.991 --> 02:24:24.030
<v Speaker 2>quickly because they can turn south </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

3028
02:24:24.031 --> 02:24:28.500
<v Speaker 2>But there was this sense of comradery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and community that that happens and then</v>

3029
02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:30.900
<v Speaker 2>quite a few of us all went to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel,</v>

3030
02:24:30.901 --> 02:24:31.734
<v Speaker 2>including my friend Tom Segura and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and his family went to this hotel </v>

3031
02:24:34.381 --> 02:24:35.214
<v Speaker 2>too with some of my friends from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood who were all there huddled </v>

3032
02:24:37.891 --> 02:24:39.000
<v Speaker 2>in together and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>

3033
02:24:39.390 --> 02:24:42.270
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were a little extra friendly.</v>

3034
02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a.</v>

3035
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:44.663
<v Speaker 2>There was the same kind of feeling after</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 when I was in New York </v>

3036
02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:48.803
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was people are little bit more </v>

3037
02:24:50.041 --> 02:24:50.620
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>

3038
02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:52.690
<v Speaker 3>We felt that during the ice storm back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the day,</v>

3039
02:24:52.691 --> 02:24:57.220
<v Speaker 3>people were like I saying the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we live on,</v>

3040
02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:58.420
<v Speaker 3>and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3041
02:24:58.450 --> 02:25:00.490
<v Speaker 3>who's got a wood burning stove?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

3042
02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:01.324
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger does come over and then people </v>

3043
02:25:02.831 --> 02:25:03.664
<v Speaker 3>would go to Roger's house and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden all these neighbors that just </v>

3044
02:25:05.711 --> 02:25:06.544
<v Speaker 3>wave at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all at Roger's house by the wood </v>

3045
02:25:09.311 --> 02:25:10.144
<v Speaker 3>burning stove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going back to the houses to get </v>

3046
02:25:12.941 --> 02:25:14.440
<v Speaker 3>blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>planning,</v>

3047
02:25:14.441 --> 02:25:18.100
<v Speaker 3>sleeping arrangements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>planning food arrangements,</v>

3048
02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:19.263
<v Speaker 3>and assessing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving each other their personal space </v>

3049
02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:23.103
<v Speaker 3>and learning how to speak to each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a respect of mattered that we might </v>

3050
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:30.961
<v Speaker 3>have to do this for several days and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the through tragedy,</v>

3051
02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:38.260
<v Speaker 3>a sense of community was built somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>or reinforced for a brief moment in time</v>

3052
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>which made going back to our regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives on that street better.</v>

3053
02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3054

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3055

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3057
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he kind of talks about that,</v>

3058
02:25:52.221 --> 02:25:53.054
<v Speaker 2>about how in part situations of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and when people are really </v>

3059
02:25:58.131 --> 02:26:01.850
<v Speaker 2>pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people bond together and they find</v>

3060
02:26:01.851 --> 02:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>that these are the happiest times of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>

3061
02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>People that even go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that they missed the comradery</v>

3062
02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:10.280
<v Speaker 2>of the bunker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They admit the miss,</v>

3063
02:26:10.281 --> 02:26:12.050
<v Speaker 2>the camaraderie of being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trenches.</v>

3064
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>They missed the camaraderie of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

3065
02:26:14.421 --> 02:26:15.254
<v Speaker 2>huddled up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what's going to happen in </v>

3066
02:26:17.271 --> 02:26:18.104
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but counting and dependent upon each </v>

3067
02:26:19.641 --> 02:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>other for their very live.</v>

3228
02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 3>so that was flattering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3230
02:33:54.571 --> 02:33:59.430
<v Speaker 3>a little lunch and do we talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they pitched us to take over one of</v>

3231
02:33:59.431 --> 02:34:00.264
<v Speaker 3>the rooms and the palms upstairs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I always flattering we had a </v>

3232
02:34:05.161 --> 02:34:05.994
<v Speaker 3>wonderful meeting but we knew right away</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were having the meeting and that </v>

3233
02:34:08.371 --> 02:34:10.490
<v Speaker 3>was not for us and it was never going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

3234
02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:11.333
<v Speaker 3>We have young children and we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad place to at the time was tough in </v>

3235
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:17.610
<v Speaker 3>our life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3236
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 3>still</v>

3237
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.670
<v Speaker 5>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still not.</v>

3238
02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was pretty dark,</v>

3239
02:34:21.251 --> 02:34:25.570
<v Speaker 5>but it was nice and flattering and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think fred moved them onto mark Vacherie</v>

3240
02:34:25.571 --> 02:34:29.920
<v Speaker 5>who eventually did the project from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Philadelphia and in retrospect,</v>

3241
02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:33.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3242
02:34:33.221 --> 02:34:34.960
<v Speaker 5>I was nice flattering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we wouldn't do that.</v>

3243
02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way we couldn't do joe beef </v>

3244
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 5>anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't eat.</v>

3245
02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:42.430
<v Speaker 5>The dining public doesn't exist unless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it's on my street.</v>

3246
02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:44.320
<v Speaker 5>So Montreal is just such a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3247
02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:49.180
<v Speaker 5>The idea is like when before they </v>
<v Speaker 5>offered any a room there,</v>

3248
02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:50.073
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there like a decommission laundromat </v>

3249
02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:54.453
<v Speaker 5>in the back?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where employees only that reset </v>

3250
02:34:56.890 --> 02:34:57.723
<v Speaker 5>all the wrong things mad at 800 square </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet that we can make a five table </v>

3251
02:35:01.181 --> 02:35:04.120
<v Speaker 5>French restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're pitching us the top floor of the</v>

3252
02:35:04.121 --> 02:35:04.954
<v Speaker 5>palms and we're asking for the door next</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the garbage container in the alley </v>

3253
02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:09.033
<v Speaker 5>with no windows and they were looking at</v>
<v Speaker 5>us like we're insane table for trust </v>

3254
02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:17.570
<v Speaker 5>rather than his brother and his brother </v>
<v Speaker 5>was looking at Lorenzo like,</v>

3255
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:22.330
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we sent them some books.</v>

3256
02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm sure they're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's such a funny,</v>

3257
02:35:27.370 --> 02:35:30.240
<v Speaker 5>funny way of responding to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want to give you the top four,</v>

3258
02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:31.093
<v Speaker 5>the palms in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have for fucking 800 hundred </v>

3259
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:37.150
<v Speaker 5>square foot room and the back alley that</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody could access?</v>

3260
02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:38.733
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't make it so expensive that </v>
<v Speaker 5>basketball players think it's too much </v>

3261
02:35:40.751 --> 02:35:43.240
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3262
02:35:43.241 --> 02:35:47.200
<v Speaker 5>that would be a very interesting spot </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure it would if,</v>

3263
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:48.043
<v Speaker 5>if you did create something like that or</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone did an unbelievably exclusive </v>

3264
02:35:52.631 --> 02:35:53.464
<v Speaker 5>spot that literally has 20 seats </v>
<v Speaker 5>available in a night and they only open </v>

3265
02:35:57.911 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 5>for one sitting right there and we want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to build the.</v>

3266
02:36:01.390 --> 02:36:03.520
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the movie the Roxbury.</v>

3267
02:36:04.390 --> 02:36:08.300
<v Speaker 5>We want to build the French connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That restaurant all the other one with j</v>

3268
02:36:08.301 --> 02:36:09.134
<v Speaker 5>dot lo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that one?</v>

3269
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Gigli.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ishtar made major Manhattan.</v>

3270
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:15.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guarantee if someone did do </v>

3271
02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:20.080
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly because of Vegas,</v>

3272
02:36:20.081 --> 02:36:21.900
<v Speaker 5>it's all about who you know and who you.</v>

3273
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:23.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can get in,</v>

3274
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get into Joe Lamb.</v>

3275
02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Joe Lammas in Vegas.</v>

3276
02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:30.310
<v Speaker 5>It's right behind the garbage container.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The leaky one.</v>

3277
02:36:30.311 --> 02:36:31.720
<v Speaker 5>Next to the grease trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3278
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Girls and they're Jimmy Choo's have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>step through these puddles of greys.</v>

3279
02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Louboutin on their way to the back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it would,</v>

3280
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:40.893
<v Speaker 5>ironically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be probably the hot spot in </v>

3281
02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:44.830
<v Speaker 5>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know Joel,</v>

3282
02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:45.763

<v Speaker 5>Lorenzo didn't get it probably wouldn't </v>

3283
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:51.100
<v Speaker 5>be very profitable though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously.</v>

3284
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:53.320
<v Speaker 5>Well when they took over the palms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was excited.</v>

3285
02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:56.560
<v Speaker 5>I know that nine steakhouse there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>excellent.</v>

3286
02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 5>I haven't been there in years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I used to be a great place,</v>

3287
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.880
<v Speaker 5>but mark was there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3306
02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.213
<v Speaker 3>we took that kind of like,</v>

02:37:47.530 --> 02:37:51.140
<v Speaker 3>They have 24 seats and he bought a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>red slicer and he said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So when we open joe beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first items on the menu was </v>

3316
02:38:08.181 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 3>our version of the lobster spaghetti </v>
<v Speaker 3>that mark vettery was doing.</v>

3317
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And just a simple homage to that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later,</v>

3318
02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:20.390
<v Speaker 3>years later we met him and we told them </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story and became friends.</v>

3319
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:24.170
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why did it take for seats?</v>

3320
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:25.580
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this thing look like?</v>

3321
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3322
02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.450
<v Speaker 3>you seen those big Italian red burchell </v>
<v Speaker 3>a meat slicers.</v>

3323
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:31.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley.</v>

3324
02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.133
<v Speaker 3>So did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because it would add to the </v>

3325
02:38:34.101 --> 02:38:36.350
<v Speaker 3>ambiance to have this cool thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italy.</v>

3326
02:38:36.351 --> 02:38:39.940
<v Speaker 3>This is a pretty standard piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment that you'd have on the bars.</v>

3327
02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Does it turns slow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big blade that rotates slowly.</v>

3328
02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very sharp.</v>

3329
02:38:45.351 --> 02:38:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't a pinwheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:38:47.250 --> 02:38:49.550
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't melt the fat of the Ham.</v>

3331
02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't get this white film.</v>

3332
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:55.850
<v Speaker 3>So it makes like perfectly thin cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>slices of perfect ham.</v>
