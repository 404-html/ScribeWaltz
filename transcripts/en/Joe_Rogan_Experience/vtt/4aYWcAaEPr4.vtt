1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.443
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches of the faction that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to become prime minister was by </v>

2
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>guaranteeing them that he wouldn't move </v>
<v Speaker 1>too fast on gay marriage.</v>

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.623
<v Speaker 1>So it's a minority of a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of concern of like culturally </v>

4
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.054
<v Speaker 1>conservative conservatives who represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural districts with a bunch of farmers </v>

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>and the farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>it's always God damn farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke,</v>

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.853
<v Speaker 1>one of my old specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only two types of people that </v>

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>care about gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were really dumb,</v>

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>or people that are secretly worry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks are delicious.</v>

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Fucking farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got to get them to suck a dick</v>

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>all the Hoopla about what about just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and suck it.</v>

14
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't even like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd be like,</v>

15
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very guy.</v>

16
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the guy who was second oldest</v>

17
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>whole sticks and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a claw is that Seattle was,</v>

18
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>he was dressed up in like leather and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd go out in the farm in the middle of</v>

19
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the night and he'd like give.</v>

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.243
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the guy who got </v>

21
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>arrested several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the guy with died.</v>

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>He died from getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was.</v>

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>They used to call him Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hands.</v>

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I love that you know his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>There was a documentary called zoo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.023
<v Speaker 1>it was all about zoophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a real sexual attraction that </v>

27
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>people have to farm animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always white people by the way.</v>

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] hollow white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.133
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy who got arrested was </v>

30
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just covered in leather,</v>

31
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>black leather bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from Australia.</v>

32
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.793
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of adding insult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury for the animal that you're </v>

33
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>actually wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leather.</v>

34
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.204
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing.</v>

35
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing your skin at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time as I.</v>

36
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not wearing a horse here though.</v>

37
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.981
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different species,</v>

39
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm this guy who lived in enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>claw.</v>

40
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>They had found each other online on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the horse,</v>

41
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.843
<v Speaker 1>him and all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they developed this relationship online </v>

42
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.863
<v Speaker 1>with these people that were really into </v>
<v Speaker 1>horses and getting fucked by farm </v>

43
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:08.394
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they invested in this property </v>

44
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and they got this farm and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>these horses.</v>

45
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>There was over 100 hours of footage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people getting fucked by animals.</v>

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they type it.</v>

47
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

53
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.820

<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>

56
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Charges in Tennessee.</v>

57
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

58
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it was a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year is this?</v>

59
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after I'm.</v>

60
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>That guy was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

61
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

62
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>A former Washington state man who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>convicted of at an enum cloth farm where</v>

63
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>a man was fatally injured while having </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with a horse in 2005.</v>

64
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is accused of having sex with animals on</v>

65
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.394
<v Speaker 1>a Tennessee farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the same people that was in </v>

66
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to grow out of it.</v>

67
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.823
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you're hardwired is the way </v>

68
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you're hardwired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

69
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.763
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think the ones my friend got </v>

70
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>fucked to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might want to reconsider it.</v>

71
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that sensible,</v>

72
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.094
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing is like being gay or </v>

73
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:25.684
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get in trouble because when we </v>

74
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>talk about pedophilia and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

75
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I sort of make the same analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I have.</v>

76
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean whilst it's the worst conceivable</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that I can imagine anyone doing </v>

77
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.674
<v Speaker 1>morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some sympathy for people who are </v>

78
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.344
<v Speaker 1>hard wired in such a way that they get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on from infants or animals or </v>

79
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:41.921
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

80
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:42.754
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason I'm not a pedophile is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I'm morally superior is </v>

81
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>because I've never been attracted to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anyone who's not post pubescent,</v>

82
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're right.</v>

83
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.403
<v Speaker 1>The real problem becomes in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decipher what is causing some person to </v>

84
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.004
<v Speaker 1>have these feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it an instance of them being </v>

85
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>molested themselves and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>

86
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>which is Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disproportionately.</v>

87
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the spectrum of a different ways </v>

88
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:15.661
<v Speaker 1>that the mind functions is so complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so confusing as to what's the origin</v>

89
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 1>of these behavior patterns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of abuse is because of a </v>

90
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>malfunction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a,</v>

91
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.293
<v Speaker 1>is there a tumor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is going on in </v>

92
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.024
<v Speaker 1>someone's brain that leads them down </v>
<v Speaker 1>these paths and I don't think that's </v>

93
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>been answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

94
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the ticket back to be bestiality</v>

95
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and like having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a horse a blow job.</v>

96
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.193
<v Speaker 1>Like is there anything necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>unethical about giving a host of blow </v>

97
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>job is the horse is pushing back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say no,</v>

98
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.103
<v Speaker 1>what if?</v>

99
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

100
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you offer up your butt to a horse and</v>

101
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just digging in there.</v>

102
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>He just shook his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you though,</v>

103
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.324
<v Speaker 1>like what is morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is actually morally wrong with </v>

104
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking a horse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the horse is into it?</v>

105
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Well the horse fucks you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all the horses is a top.</v>

106
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

107
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>the video of the guy getting fucked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death by the horse though is horrific of</v>

108
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.054
<v Speaker 1>course available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was he not able to get out of this </v>

109
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the horse out of pin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>around my house just in case somebody </v>

115
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.620

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

235

<v Speaker 1>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take care of.</v>

241
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:52.360

<v Speaker 1>Gilis fucking way to die.</v>

242
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>The Darwin awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one who may be awesome.</v>

243
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.723
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's better than being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nursing home and having some guy kick </v>

244
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:00.274
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there anything in between that </v>

245
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>allows my only two options?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either they get to Beta nursing home and</v>

246
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.503
<v Speaker 1>somebody kicked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to get mainly raped to death by a </v>

247
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

248
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Gender options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

249
00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:11.944
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point of view is that this guy in </v>

00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:14.794
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked to death by a horse </v>

251
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:18.964
<v Speaker 1>provided me with hundreds of hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment that I would have never </v>

252
00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:25.510
<v Speaker 1>gotten without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy dies of als has only one minute</v>

<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've watched it so many times,</v>

255
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about all the people </v>

256
00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:35.980
<v Speaker 1>throughout the world who will now Google</v>

<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

279
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:32.161
<v Speaker 1>on the edge of the top of us guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

281
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you're counting on these Chinese lithium</v>
<v Speaker 1>ion batteries.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who knows if they're going to burst into</v>

283
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's doing handstands.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that gives you a thrill,</v>

289
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.703
