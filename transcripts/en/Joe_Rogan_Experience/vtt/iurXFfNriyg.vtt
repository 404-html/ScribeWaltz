<v Speaker 1>Ma'Am.</v>

7
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>You have a real flip phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a real foot said that you.</v>

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>You didn't go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never left.</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I never left her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you never went like iphone,</v>

10
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>android?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

12
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>never even thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never even thought about it.</v>

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see people taking pictures and using</v>

14
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>apps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

15
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

17
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the APP so I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no draw at all.</v>

18
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that using the internet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answering email.</v>

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I have a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a laptop at home and I do access </v>

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're out you don't want to </v>

21
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>mess with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one of them out.</v>

22
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to be out in the world.</v>

23
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

24
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the world.</v>

25
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get either thing.</v>

26
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>He would get along very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Ari,</v>

27
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>he went back to a flip phone and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks disdainfully sort of like a former</v>

28
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics look it at everybody with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

29
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way you could just enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>one drink you loser,</v>

30
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

32
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I just look around at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm an anthropologist and I am </v>

34
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>interested in human behavior and I look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the behavior like literally the </v>

35
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>physical behavior of people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with smartphones and it doesn't,</v>

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>it looks I'm antisocial and unhappy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious and I don't want to be.</v>

37
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to feel like.</v>

38
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I think those people feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

39
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>

40
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm a junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

41
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because,</v>

42
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:42.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a restaurant the other day and </v>

43
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.761
<v Speaker 1>I was looking around and literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the restaurant was looking </v>

44
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:43.761
<v Speaker 1>at their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was talking to,</v>

45
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking,</v>

46
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:49.731
<v Speaker 1>what if there was a drug that did that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there was a drug that didn't </v>

47
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.241
<v Speaker 1>kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just sucked up all your time and </v>

48
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.011
<v Speaker 1>you just stared blankly at your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did everything that you do while </v>

49
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you're using a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be terrified,</v>

50
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>like you're staring at your hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed into cars.</v>

51
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>You're staring at your hand and walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Poles.</v>

52
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that social media.</v>

54
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the big lie of our generation is</v>

55
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>the phrase social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really isn't.</v>

56
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It's antisocial media and it has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of uses and know whatever.</v>

57
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>But it's not social in any human sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

58
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at suicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression rates,</v>

59
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>ptsd rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety rates,</v>

60
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>they're doing nothing but going up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our society,</v>

61
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>just something tragic just happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

63
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are indicators of something and </v>

64
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.731
<v Speaker 1>they're all going up in our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that we're a very </v>

65
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:37.731
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

66
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>relatively peaceful society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something's going on.</v>

67
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>the internet or social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean obviously,</v>

69
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that those things are </v>

70
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.591
<v Speaker 1>happening at the same time does make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder that these new devices certainly </v>

71
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>don't bring happiness because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers are going in the wrong </v>

72
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're designed to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

74
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's certainly designed to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you access to information go perhaps,</v>

75
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

76
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>with some discipline they can be used in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a way that that benefit</v>

77
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.450
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

78
00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:10.451
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of that information is </v>

79
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:10.451
<v Speaker 3>available in your laptop at your desk at</v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

80
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people want to be socially,</v>

81
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 3>socially connected constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what they're doing and that I </v>

82
00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:26.081
<v Speaker 3>think keeps people from actually fully </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing whatever they're actually </v>

83
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:26.990
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's definitely some truth to</v>

84
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.390
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do like the fact that I can ask my</v>

85
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.400
<v Speaker 3>phone questions like if I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and I can add a new feature on </v>

86
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.801
<v Speaker 3>this Google Pixel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we squeezed the side of it and the </v>

87
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Google assistant comes up and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask it questions.</v>

88
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You squeeze it and ask a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

89
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.310
<v Speaker 3>that's some space age shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

90
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.510
<v Speaker 3>or it's downright creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 3>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

92
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

93
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

94
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you have all of human knowledge in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>front pocket.</v>

95
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accessible at every moment.</v>

96
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I do understand the power of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the appeal of it.</v>

97
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there aren't great things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

98
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Of course there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

99
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me the downside outweighs the upside</v>

100
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 3>for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it doesn't.</v>

101
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:11.441
<v Speaker 3>But if you look again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at mental health statistics </v>

102
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.321
<v Speaker 3>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing something wrong because </v>

103
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:14.321
<v Speaker 3>they're all going in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

104
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder if the mental health </v>

105
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.890
<v Speaker 3>statistics are indicative of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

106
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think lifestyle,</v>

107
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 2>what you do with your time during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

108
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980
<v Speaker 2>and I know a lot of people live a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply unsatisfying lives and I don't </v>

109
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 2>know if the phone accentuates that </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

110
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were talking the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>about we were at the airport,</v>

111
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>we're waiting to fly home and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>some girl and she was talking,</v>

112
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:43.011
<v Speaker 2>we were just ease dropping and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about like the amazing race and </v>

113
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 2>how she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 2>this show so boring now and I can't wait</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

115
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat this and then I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat that and I,</v>

116
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to get a raise at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all nonsense,</v>

117
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 2>non engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not interesting.</v>

118
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.320
<v Speaker 2>There's no real life to anything she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

119
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 2>And like this is most of our country or</v>

120
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 3>a large part of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh absolutely.</v>

121
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing about social media is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it sort of weaponizes blend this,</v>

122
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 3>it allows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives people a platform for the most </v>

123
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 3>mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uninteresting aspects of their lives </v>

124
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.071
<v Speaker 3>because they have to constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly be producing some kind of </v>

125
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 3>output of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and if not,</v>

126
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 3>producing it certainly absorbing it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

127
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were both feeling good</v>

128
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 2>mining when I'm on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothin,</v>

129
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>nothin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothin,</v>

130
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 2>nothin.</v>

131
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh murder.</v>

132
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh look at this little monkey found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

133
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

134
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's other people you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have on the show that could speak more </v>

135
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 3>intelligently to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that,</v>

136
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that um,</v>

137
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 3>risk of suicide and face facebook are </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlated.</v>

138
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are are on facebook and in </v>

139
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.951
<v Speaker 3>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are at an increased risk of </v>

140
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 3>depression and thoughts of suicide and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that.</v>

141
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

142
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's correlation </v>

143
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>equals causation though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

144
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that people on facebook all</v>

145
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the time are doing that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already depressed?</v>

146
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

147
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the question and what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation means.</v>

148
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 3>We have to look at something more </v>
<v Speaker 3>closely.</v>

149
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anxiety rates and teenagers have </v>

150
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.340
<v Speaker 3>skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

151
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 3>anxiety partly comes from a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>painful self awareness.</v>

152
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:24.451
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's amplified by social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media because you can never escape the </v>

153
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:24.451
<v Speaker 3>opinions of your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

154
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.390
<v Speaker 3>that's crippling to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

155
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:26.320
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

156
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't the most popular kid in class </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a long shot.</v>

157
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:29.710
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I came home,</v>

158
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever my whatever my issues were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were on hold until,</v>

159
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid in high school,</v>

160
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 3>there was issues around hold till 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM the next morning.</v>

161
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:42.421
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a 12 hour break from your </v>

162
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:42.421
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you don't.</v>

163
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:42.421
<v Speaker 3>And it's really tough on kids.</v>

164
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine growing up today,</v>

165
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I think we got very lucky that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we experienced the Internet in </v>

167
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

169
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>think I was 27 the first time I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone online and that's a nice,</v>

170
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one knew what online was back </v>

171
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't leaving any traces,</v>

172
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you were just going out and looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

173
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

175
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

176
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 3>How old was I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was about 36.</v>

177
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember a girl asked me,</v>

178
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 3>do you ever logged on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>

179
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald,</v>

180
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to explain to me what that </v>

181
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 2>meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I literally said to all,</v>

182
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 2>that's never going to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

183
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 2>That's like a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.740
<v Speaker 2>isn't that what they said about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first computers,</v>

186
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.120
<v Speaker 2>like that was one of IBM's a initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactions to the idea of the personal </v>

187
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the reaction to the first</v>

188
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:36.030
<v Speaker 2>of everything except maybe the bow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrow.</v>

189
00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean like when they invented the bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow,</v>

190
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 2>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

191
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 2>that is going to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is cool.</v>

192
00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everything else,</v>

193
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that's</v>

194
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.840
<v Speaker 3>skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't,</v>

195
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 3>we don't need anything more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

196
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.460
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the amazing thing about </v>

197
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.921
<v Speaker 3>the human mind is that we invent this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and it doesn't mean that it's </v>

198
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:57.121
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we evolved over hundreds of </v>

199
00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:57.121
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years to live a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different environment that we live now.</v>

200
00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:02.040
<v Speaker 3>So these things that we invent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that they're sort of </v>

201
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.250
<v Speaker 3>psychologically good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they definitely are incredible.</v>

202
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are definitely amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

203
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that necessarily they're </v>

204
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.901
<v Speaker 2>good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think this is kind of sound </v>

205
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:15.081
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even think they're </v>

206
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:15.081
<v Speaker 2>necessarily designed for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're designed for the future,</v>

207
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even think it's a design.</v>

208
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I just think that all things move in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever more complex direction and whatever</v>

209
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:26.691
<v Speaker 2>a person is now is not going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing a thousand years from now or </v>

210
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 2>100 years from now even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's going to be some sort of</v>

211
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:32.451
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic can actually train us in </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronics like we're going to have it </v>

212
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 2>installed in our body.</v>

213
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Well that gets to a kind of profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>question like what is the point of </v>

214
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 3>existence of human existence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of it?</v>

215
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Is the point for as many humans as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible to leafs to lead safe human </v>

216
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.000
<v Speaker 3>fulfilled lives?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it for the human race as an entity</v>

217
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 3>to produce the highest technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievements and insights,</v>

218
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

219
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.010
<v Speaker 3>and I don't have a vote either way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

220
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.020
<v Speaker 3>but that it does sort of seem to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question and that technology.</v>

221
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know does not lead to fulfillment and</v>

222
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 3>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does lead design,</v>

223
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 3>topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insight and to,</v>

224
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

225
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under profound understanding of how the </v>

226
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.590
<v Speaker 3>universe works in a physical sense.</v>

227
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if what we're doing is just </v>

228
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.951
<v Speaker 2>being caught up in the momentum of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this innovation and instead of like low </v>

229
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 2>using discipline or using some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational objective analysis of what it </v>

230
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 2>takes to be happy and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing,</v>

231
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.120
<v Speaker 2>pushing some of that stuff aside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging and actually physical </v>

232
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 2>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out and doing things and making </v>

233
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 2>that almost like a prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

234
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at your daily chart.</v>

236
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even get enough vitamins,</v>

237
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

238
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get enough activity like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

239
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You need that in order to be in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel right,</v>

240
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 2>to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel balanced.</v>

241
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it feeling right is the point of </v>

242
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.671
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then iphone are probably not a good </v>

243
00:09:59.671 --> 00:09:59.671
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

244
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 3>If the exchange of data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the exchange of information is the </v>

245
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.690
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

246
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:09.691
<v Speaker 3>then they're a great innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it really depends on what we're all </v>

247
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.061
<v Speaker 3>here for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I W I was in San Francisco with my wife </v>

248
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.821
<v Speaker 3>and I were walking behind these two kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were talking about about robots and </v>

249
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.321
<v Speaker 3>one was they were sort of kids that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sort of in the know about all </v>

250
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:19.600
<v Speaker 3>this stuff and one guy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

251
00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:20.470
<v Speaker 3>they're taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:10:20.471 --> 00:10:21.880
<v Speaker 3>in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

253
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:22.360
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

254
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:27.361
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are going to be completely </v>

255
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:27.361
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I said to my wife,</v>

256
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always were unnecessary,</v>

257
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.720
<v Speaker 3>like none of this had to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the world needs.</v>

258
00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Human beings do exist and for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose,</v>

259
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:34.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>

260
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.020
<v Speaker 3>we are here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't have to be here.</v>

261
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 3>And so if robots replace us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go right back to where we would have </v>

262
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.550
<v Speaker 3>been if we hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we hadn't evolved.</v>

263
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.220
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a funny way of thinking </v>

264
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.220
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like none of this is actually necessary.</v>

265
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.220
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be happening.</v>

266
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly doesn't.</v>

267
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

268
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 2>if we are finite life forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're only going to be lived to be,</v>

269
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 years and when your health is going </v>

270
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 2>to fail and you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>

271
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 2>what should be our goal is to feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

272
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 2>To have community in relation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of that book.</v>

273
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

274
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 2>your book's fantastic by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read it twice and I read it again.</v>

275
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I read it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I read it again since,</v>

276
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since our first podcast.</v>

277
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.150
<v Speaker 3>You very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

278
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 3>I've been getting a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep getting a lot of good responses </v>

279
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

280
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 3>and I think partly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

281
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.191
<v Speaker 3>whether you're a Democrat or Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a pretty unsettling time in </v>

282
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:29.191
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

283
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are coming to the book a </v>

284
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.031
<v Speaker 3>little bit just partly because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering what is the glue that holds us</v>

285
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 3>all together and is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it exists still.</v>

286
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

287
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:44.281
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real question in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's minds about what is it that </v>

288
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:44.281
<v Speaker 3>binds us together?</v>

289
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:44.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there certainly is.</v>

290
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:48.831
<v Speaker 2>And you really covered a lot of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just not commonly discussed aspects </v>

291
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the need for real community,</v>

292
00:11:55.061 --> 00:12:00.061
<v Speaker 2>the need to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the need to have something on the </v>

293
00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:05.041
<v Speaker 2>line now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the need to be in situations where </v>

294
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>there's real consequences and that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems that this is part of the glue that</v>

295
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>holds us together.</v>

296
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about technology is it buffers</v>

297
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:13.790
<v Speaker 3>us from real consequences in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical world,</v>

298
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 3>which is what's great about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

299
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.100
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the downside is that as you,</v>

300
00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:21.680
<v Speaker 3>as humans get buffered from consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need,</v>

301
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.170
<v Speaker 3>they need each other less and less in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to survive.</v>

302
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:29.171
<v Speaker 3>So now it's sort of modern modern homo </v>
<v Speaker 3>sapiens in a suburban house with an </v>

303
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:30.260
<v Speaker 3>iphone and a garage door opener and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

304
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a paycheck at work and you don't</v>

305
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.110
<v Speaker 3>need your neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.450
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get help.</v>

307
00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Speaker 3>You gather food or hunt food or defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from the gang,</v>

308
00:12:38.481 --> 00:12:39.740
<v Speaker 3>from the other neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

309
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 3>it all kind of gets taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a great liberation from your </v>

310
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Speaker 3>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your community.</v>

311
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 3>But it deprives you of that essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>human reliance on other people around </v>

312
00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:57.281
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes people feel good and </v>

313
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:57.281
<v Speaker 3>safe and like they're leading meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

314
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:01.391
<v Speaker 3>And so that transition to having a life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not part of any community,</v>

315
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a really tough one for people.</v>

316
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:10.661
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>for high depression rates and such in </v>

317
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.090
<v Speaker 3>high ptsd rates in our society.</v>

318
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that lack of community is a very</v>

319
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:18.741
<v Speaker 2>confusing thing when you see most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sliding into their garage and </v>

320
00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:22.371
<v Speaker 2>shutting the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into their house and they don't </v>

321
00:13:22.371 --> 00:13:24.501
<v Speaker 2>even know their neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How that's really highlighted in your </v>

322
00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:27.600
<v Speaker 2>book how alien that is to the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience until fairly recently.</v>

323
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:33.030
<v Speaker 2>This idea of like living in these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was in New York City this past </v>

324
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.191
<v Speaker 2>weekend and there's enormous apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Jim was talking about </v>

325
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lived,</v>

326
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton lives in this enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment building.</v>

327
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody there.</v>

328
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in a house,</v>

329
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.150
<v Speaker 2>a building essentially a house with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand people.</v>

330
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any of them.</v>

331
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And listen,</v>

332
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean I live in a little tenement </v>
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>

333
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same idea.</v>

334
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 3>There's a little cubby holes we all live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

335
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

336
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 3>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I grew up in a suburb,</v>

337
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 3>but I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the building I live in,</v>

338
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the lower east side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the building I live in.</v>

339
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I run into people in the landing and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>staircase.</v>

340
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 3>There's no elevator in the staircase and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to know them a little bit.</v>

341
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the suburbs is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's a stone.</v>

342
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's a stone's throw away behind a</v>

343
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:13.480
<v Speaker 3>big hedge and you and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to share an elevator with</v>

344
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 3>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be totally isolated.</v>

345
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 3>And I grew up in that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crushing and,</v>

346
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I was in a material sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was lucky we were affluent family,</v>

348
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>but I was not lucky in any human sets.</v>

349
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He say it was crushing to live the </v>

350
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 2>American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

351
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.140
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American dream is living in a nice </v>

352
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:36.140
<v Speaker 2>quiet suburb.</v>

353
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen to.</v>

354
00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot that stream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like about it,</v>

355
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

356
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data will tell you that people in </v>

357
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.330
<v Speaker 3>those situations are not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in,</v>

358
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

359
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 3>the metrics by which we measure human </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment and human happiness,</v>

360
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 3>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they suck in the suburbs.</v>

361
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

362
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

363
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and generally modern society is,</v>

364
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:03.161
<v Speaker 3>as affluence goes up in society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide rate goes up to the </v>

365
00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 3>depression rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ptsd,</v>

366
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.260
<v Speaker 3>ptsd rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff goes up with,</v>

367
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.740
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

368
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 3>without fluids.</v>

369
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed that in some of the circles</v>

370
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that I am hanging around with now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Nice people,</v>

371
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but the children of my children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my children's friends,</v>

372
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.990
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

373
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I am interacting with these people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know from work,</v>

374
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know from social circles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

375
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 2>And most of them are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them are on pills.</v>

376
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like half of them are on pills.</v>

377
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

378
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

379
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the adderall and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking anxiety medication and they're </v>

380
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.731
<v Speaker 2>taking antidepressants and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixing it all together with alcohol and </v>

381
00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:50.080
<v Speaker 2>some new freak out every week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's literally no physical fear for </v>

382
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's driving a Mercedes.</v>

383
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's living in a gated community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's.</v>

384
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.980
<v Speaker 2>It's all smooth edges and corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is a very soft and easy and </v>

385
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.750
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big appeal seems to be the newest </v>

386
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 2>objects chase the newest objects.</v>

387
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 3>It ends a really well known phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you introduce a disaster into </v>

388
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.410
<v Speaker 3>that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you introduced the blitz in London or</v>

389
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:23.940
<v Speaker 3>an earthquake or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have flood tidal wave of war.</v>

390
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.070
<v Speaker 3>People wake up out of their dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're in a kind of dream state.</v>

391
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm a part and for some people that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

392
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>induced by pills and some people it's </v>

393
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.501
<v Speaker 3>just induced by isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're in a kind of dream state </v>

394
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:42.051
<v Speaker 3>where they're not part of society in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful way and a catastrophe wakes </v>

395
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 3>them up out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

396
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 3>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean over and over again you can hear </v>

397
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 3>testimony of people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

398
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.690
<v Speaker 3>I really miss those days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The days after the earthquake,</v>

399
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.680
<v Speaker 3>during the blitz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

400
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:57.681
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you from generation after generation </v>

401
00:16:57.681 --> 00:16:57.681
<v Speaker 3>that goes through there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there their things,</v>

402
00:16:57.681 --> 00:17:02.271
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are tough things those days are </v>

403
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:02.271
<v Speaker 3>missed and they're missed because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

404
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.220
<v Speaker 3>the thing they actually like most is </v>
<v Speaker 3>being an essential part of a small group</v>

405
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.480
<v Speaker 3>that is struggling to survive.</v>

406
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Like that is the human experience for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

407
00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:11.910
<v Speaker 3>We're wired for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're wired to like it.</v>

408
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that responded to that </v>

409
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.101
<v Speaker 3>challenge tended to pass on their DNA </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that didn't respond well </v>

410
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:22.611
<v Speaker 3>didn't pass on their DNA were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>descendants of the people that sort of </v>

411
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 3>took some thrill and from that challenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

412
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 3>and acted well and with vigor and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>community in the face of hardship and </v>

413
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.640
<v Speaker 3>danger were the descendants of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people inevitably.</v>

414
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

415
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.680
<v Speaker 3>because the people that didn't act well </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't survive is as well,</v>

416
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:39.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't pass on their genes.</v>

417
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:39.840
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

418
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.780
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of the things we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>missing in the big.</v>

419
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 3>The big trick is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not saying we're now in the </v>

420
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 3>suburbs band the car and live in a lean </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

421
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean no one would say that huge to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this society too,</v>

422
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:55.611
<v Speaker 3>but the trick is how can we have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>close communal connection that buffers </v>

423
00:17:56.131 --> 00:18:01.131
<v Speaker 3>us from our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from mental health problems that makes </v>

424
00:18:01.131 --> 00:18:01.131
<v Speaker 3>us feel meaningful and fulfilled?</v>

425
00:18:01.131 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 3>How can we have that and have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of modern society,</v>

426
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

427
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 3>can we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we do both?</v>

428
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the big challenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what I see in America,</v>

429
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I love this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I see in my lifetime,</v>

430
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have mass shootings.</v>

431
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't happen.</v>

433
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 3>You go into a church with a machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill as many people as you can.</v>

434
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Let's just didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is going on?</v>

435
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean to me it's a country in kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those things are all a symptom of</v>

436
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 3>a country that's in the kind of psychic </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>

437
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people on their iphones.</v>

438
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I sort of get it but it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also it makes me think you're </v>

439
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.790
<v Speaker 3>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're so anxious that you can't </v>

440
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:43.790
<v Speaker 3>bear not to look at your feed for more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than 20 seconds.</v>

441
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an addiction for sure.</v>

442
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally getting dopamine shots </v>

443
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.750
<v Speaker 2>every time you check your feed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very small.</v>

444
00:18:52.751 --> 00:18:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a trickle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a real,</v>

445
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.550
<v Speaker 2>like it's not really worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get any real good feeling.</v>

446
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely.</v>

447
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the end of the end of it,</v>

448
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the drive in,</v>

449
00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:03.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

450
00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:05.900
<v Speaker 3>get your cheeseburger and fries and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shake or whatever.</v>

451
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Afterwards you're full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

452
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.350
<v Speaker 3>you didn't get any nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

453
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.080
<v Speaker 3>and social media is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of socially full.</v>

454
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.020
<v Speaker 3>But actually it's all calories that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

455
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to sustain you.</v>

456
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found for me personally that people</v>

457
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of fulfillment out of tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>

458
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>of likeminded people doing similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are difficult.</v>

459
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it amongst like rock climbers,</v>

460
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot of rock climbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

461
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.910
<v Speaker 2>they find like real community in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock climbers and runners get it.</v>

462
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

463
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 2>And the Jiu Jitsu community horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

464
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

465
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:49.851
<v Speaker 2>I experienced it in a deep way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I ever went hunting </v>

466
00:19:49.851 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 2>because hunting was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had a wall that I didn't know.</v>

467
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 2>There was a door on it and I opened up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the door and oh,</v>

468
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole new area back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your,</v>

469
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 2>your DNA like goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what to do with this.</v>

470
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.410
<v Speaker 2>We're hunting now and you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

471
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:09.411
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is lighting up parts of my </v>

472
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>brain or parts of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my genetics.</v>

473
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

474
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I went through that same door when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started boxing.</v>

475
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 3>I started late in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 50.</v>

476
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:21.201
<v Speaker 3>I go through a big life change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first marriage ended and I needed </v>

477
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed something a little different.</v>

478
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really works for people is a situation </v>

479
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:32.181
<v Speaker 3>where they're evaluated for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior rather than for how and where </v>

480
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 3>they were born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

481
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So or how much money they have,</v>

482
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 3>which is a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it is a function of a to some degree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

484
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 3>how you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you were born.</v>

485
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

486
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

487
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 3>in high school you evaluated for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

488
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 3>you come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you look for all that stuff.</v>

489
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 3>You don't have control over any of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

490
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 3>But in the boxing ring out hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a million things like this,</v>

492
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.670
<v Speaker 3>you're evaluated by your peers for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct and that you have complete </v>

493
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 3>control over soldiers the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

494
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:05.850
<v Speaker 3>and I was with this platoon in combat </v>
<v Speaker 3>for non,</v>

495
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 3>for a year in eastern Afghanistan.</v>

496
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Those guys didn't care if you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>luck with your bad looking if your dad </v>

497
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 3>was in prison or not really give a shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

498
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 3>That what they cared is how you acted in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that situation.</v>

499
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 3>And would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you,</v>

500
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.600
<v Speaker 3>would you put the group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the welfare of the group ahead of your </v>

501
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Speaker 3>own welfare?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was his basic human basic human</v>

502
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:30.301
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the group more important to you than </v>

503
00:21:30.301 --> 00:21:33.121
<v Speaker 3>you are to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we all answered that question </v>

504
00:21:33.121 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 3>with a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're good.</v>

505
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in situations,</v>

506
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 3>hunting in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

507
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:43.801
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're not bringing your street </v>

508
00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:43.801
<v Speaker 3>identity in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

509
00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:48.210
<v Speaker 3>you're just a human being trying to act </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as possible with dignity and </v>

510
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 3>respect for others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're good and it doesn't matter.</v>

511
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you suck at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

512
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you have that basic respect </v>

513
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.341
<v Speaker 3>and hard work ethic and being freed from</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things you're not responsible for </v>

514
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.250
<v Speaker 3>and so and are not judged for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a huge liberation and it really </v>

515
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>makes people feel close to each other.</v>

516
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so people need mom and it's also.</v>

517
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that a lot of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on today is just the fact that I don't </v>

518
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.530
<v Speaker 4>think people are supposed to work in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>office all day.</v>

519
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably bad for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>

520
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.740
<v Speaker 4>I think it's sitting in a chair all day </v>
<v Speaker 4>is terrible for you.</v>

521
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:24.620
<v Speaker 4>I think staring at a computer all day is</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible for you.</v>

522
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 4>All these things that people do or just </v>
<v Speaker 4>counter to their contrary to what your </v>

523
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.840
<v Speaker 4>body was designed for and that must </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause a lot of depression and anxiety in</v>

524
00:22:35.841 --> 00:22:36.260
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

525
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

526
00:22:37.171 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to know what we were evolved</v>

527
00:22:39.571 --> 00:22:44.571
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at current modern day </v>

528
00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:48.321
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherers who more or less </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists agree represent our </v>

529
00:22:48.321 --> 00:22:51.561
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary past and you'll find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's at least two hours of pretty </v>

530
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:52.980
<v Speaker 3>vigorous movement everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

531
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:58.010
<v Speaker 3>fast walking basically two hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 3>by virtually everyone in the community.</v>

532
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are almost never out of contact </v>

533
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

534
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean out of physical products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proximity with other people that you </v>

535
00:23:08.631 --> 00:23:11.961
<v Speaker 3>know extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's about four or five hours a day </v>

536
00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:14.640
<v Speaker 3>devoted to survival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food gathering,</v>

537
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:15.900
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We work eight,</v>

538
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:16.860
<v Speaker 3>10 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

539
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.260
<v Speaker 3>The most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote primitive hunter gatherers and </v>

540
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.651
<v Speaker 3>some of the harshest environments in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world spend around four hours a day </v>

541
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:26.040
<v Speaker 3>surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it survival is a group endeavor.</v>

542
00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:30.630
<v Speaker 3>It brings everyone together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's needed high protein,</v>

543
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:33.110
<v Speaker 3>low no processed foods obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

544
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

545
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.050
<v Speaker 3>the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's a very pure diet.</v>

546
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people who live like that have </v>

547
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:42.500
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily good health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

548
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 3>and if they survive childbirth and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>first early years,</v>

549
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm often live into their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into their seventies,</v>

550
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 3>eighties to 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

551
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>West Bay basically live as long as </v>

552
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 3>westerners do with no medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention.</v>

553
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty extraordinary.</v>

554
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.460
<v Speaker 3>That is externally</v>

555
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.740
<v Speaker 2>when you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

556
00:23:58.741 --> 00:24:01.800
<v Speaker 2>what I saw an article and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read the article,</v>

557
00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:06.801
<v Speaker 2>but the headline was something along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of I was talking about artificial </v>

558
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:10.491
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the rise of artificial </v>

559
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.300
<v Speaker 2>intelligence will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 2>will even out inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember looking at that and one </v>

561
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>boy that's like giving into the hive </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

562
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.790
<v Speaker 2>like artificial intelligence is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure all the woes of the world.</v>

563
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll let the computer thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and everything's going to be even.</v>

564
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm thinking about it,</v>

565
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.460
<v Speaker 3>the two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were walking behind San Francisco,</v>

566
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.300
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was artificial intelligence they were</v>

567
00:24:34.301 --> 00:24:35.920
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously they're connected.</v>

568
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.080
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

569
00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 3>it was ai and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

570
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

571
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's either ai is either the </v>
<v Speaker 3>final blossoming of the human mind or </v>

572
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.470
<v Speaker 3>it's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone knows which it is.</v>

573
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.050
<v Speaker 3>It could easily</v>

574
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 2>be the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking for the last few </v>

575
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.360
<v Speaker 2>years that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're some sort of electronic </v>

576
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 2>caterpillar is giving birth to some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly.</v>

577
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing is we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the biological thing that makes </v>

578
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>the electronic thing and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic thing is going to go,</v>

579
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 2>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got it now.</v>

580
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And then we assume that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we hold dear,</v>

581
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 2>like emotions and comradery and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that we have community,</v>

582
00:25:14.001 --> 00:25:14.960
<v Speaker 2>that that's important.</v>

583
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:15.850
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

584
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 2>if we live and we die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to us while we're alive.</v>

585
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:26.401
<v Speaker 2>But what if we didn't exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it important in air quotes to the </v>

586
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:28.030
<v Speaker 2>universe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it important to the planet?</v>

587
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily just important as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human</v>

588
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:36.670
<v Speaker 3>understanding of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it was incalculably unlikely </v>

589
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.380
<v Speaker 3>that the universe would exist and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>life would start on this particular </v>

590
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 3>planet or on any planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it was extremely unlikely that even</v>

591
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:49.451
<v Speaker 3>the universe would exist and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard to say that anything would </v>

592
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 3>be important to add to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a system that,</v>

593
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.640
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

594
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.740
<v Speaker 3>statistically shouldn't have happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that doesn't have a conscious and </v>

595
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 3>moral mind behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

596
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

597
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:08.681
<v Speaker 3>of course we're not important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we were sitting on the moon </v>

598
00:26:08.681 --> 00:26:11.621
<v Speaker 3>and you watched a nuclear exchange </v>
<v Speaker 3>between Russia and the United States </v>

599
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 3>that obliterated civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were sitting on the moon,</v>

600
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:18.671
<v Speaker 3>you'd barely be able to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would barely notice anything </v>

601
00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:18.671
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

602
00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty close.</v>

603
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Of course it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So keep in mind that all those emotions,</v>

604
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:27.940
<v Speaker 3>everything we are had survival value in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our past or we,</v>

605
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.170
<v Speaker 3>that we wouldn't have those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

606
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

607
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.651
<v Speaker 3>we're the legacy of an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>process that went on for 2 million </v>

608
00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:37.400
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we feel sadness,</v>

609
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>if we feel anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we feel shame,</v>

610
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 3>all of those things had survival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival,</v>

611
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:47.531
<v Speaker 3>value for humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the individuals that had the </v>

612
00:26:47.531 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 3>capacity for those emotions made better </v>
<v Speaker 3>citizens within their little community.</v>

613
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 3>We're better hunters were better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

614
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 3>and so those emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find them meaningful,</v>

615
00:26:56.911 --> 00:27:01.911
<v Speaker 3>but actually what they are is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>helped us survive and now we have so </v>

616
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 3>altered our circumstances that survival </v>
<v Speaker 3>is no longer a question.</v>

617
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 3>And so what do we do with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings?</v>

618
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:14.661
<v Speaker 3>What did we do with those capacities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to hunt that the dopamine </v>

619
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 3>that you get from hitting a target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

620
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 3>teenage boys will sit in a basement for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

621
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.980
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years playing video games to practice </v>

622
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.991
<v Speaker 3>their training for hunting right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning for hunting and war and they're </v>

623
00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:30.081
<v Speaker 3>getting rewarded with dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what should have been </v>

624
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:30.081
<v Speaker 3>happening for 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

625
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 3>And now there's nothing to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to fight.</v>

626
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 3>They're still doing the behavior as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>should because they're wired for it,</v>

627
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 3>but there's no useful purpose for it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making themselves irrelevant.</v>

628
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.090
<v Speaker 3>They're human casualties of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology and it's,</v>

629
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I find it really tragic.</v>

630
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Are they more irrelevant than someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who plays sports?</v>

631
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think our relevance comes from our,</v>

632
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our relationship with our community and </v>

633
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.870
<v Speaker 3>our society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

634
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.710
<v Speaker 3>at least if you play sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're part of,</v>

635
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you're part of the human community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

636
00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:09.171
<v Speaker 3>and when you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're playing a video game by </v>

637
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:09.171
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really not</v>

638
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 2>by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of kids,</v>

639
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:14.721
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing now is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing these online games at playing </v>

640
00:28:14.721 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>against other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk to each other online.</v>

641
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:18.260
<v Speaker 2>They have headsets and they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

642
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 2>east sports is a big growing thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

643
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:23.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

644
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating thing because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also sort of based on your ability to </v>

645
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 2>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.550
<v Speaker 2>the ones who are the heroes are the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are like,</v>

647
00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was playing quake,</v>

648
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 2>there was this dude named fatality was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

649
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.650
<v Speaker 2>his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just killed everybody was awesome,</v>

650
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.520
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.530
<v Speaker 2>he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the king because he was just the </v>

652
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.440
<v Speaker 2>best at the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the community of people that were </v>

653
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 2>only judged by their performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had risen to this very high level,</v>

654
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but it was a community.</v>

655
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

656
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.590
<v Speaker 3>if you look at humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at chimpanzees,</v>

657
00:28:54.591 --> 00:28:57.850
<v Speaker 3>we clearly need the proximity of others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the physical proximity about it.</v>

658
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the only way I can evaluate that </v>

659
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.111
<v Speaker 3>is to say that's an that's awesome </v>
<v Speaker 3>training for hunting and war and the </v>

660
00:29:05.301 --> 00:29:08.930
<v Speaker 3>military does use those games to train </v>
<v Speaker 3>their soldiers and so I get it.</v>

661
00:29:08.931 --> 00:29:13.931
<v Speaker 3>It's effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would do is look at suicide and </v>

662
00:29:13.931 --> 00:29:15.620
<v Speaker 3>depression rates and gamers and see are </v>
<v Speaker 3>they above or below the national average</v>

663
00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:20.090
<v Speaker 3>for that age group and if they're above </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's a problem.</v>

664
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Either depressive people are seeking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as a refuge or that activity makes </v>

665
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.330
<v Speaker 3>people withdrawn and depressed and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know like either way it's a problem that</v>

666
00:29:29.331 --> 00:29:31.340
<v Speaker 3>needs to be solved that I have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the data is,</v>

667
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.840
<v Speaker 3>but that's where I would look.</v>

668
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're researching all this data </v>

669
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:37.910
<v Speaker 2>and you're putting together a book like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe in your,</v>

670
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 2>you're putting it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you thinking to yourself that you </v>

671
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 2>have know that it's</v>

672
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 4>not just an interesting study on human </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior,</v>

673
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's also probably important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to read,</v>

674
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 4>to kind of get an understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

675
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:56.191
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get an understanding of what it is </v>

676
00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 4>it's causing people to have all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and anxiety that it may be.</v>

677
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that needs to be said.</v>

678
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any categories,</v>

679
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.520
<v Speaker 3>category statement I shouldn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of authors when they write </v>

680
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.241
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their firm conviction that their </v>

681
00:30:11.241 --> 00:30:11.730
<v Speaker 3>book needs to be read by the public and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will help the public in some way,</v>

682
00:30:11.731 --> 00:30:16.731
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will eliminate life illuminated </v>

683
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:16.731
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luminate the world in some way.</v>

684
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:16.731
<v Speaker 3>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

685
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:19.380
<v Speaker 3>that's just a starting point for the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of work that a book takes,</v>

686
00:30:19.381 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a child.</v>

687
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Your assumption is the child is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good person in the world.</v>

688
00:30:23.581 --> 00:30:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Not a terrible person winds up shooting </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a church,</v>

689
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a starting basic assumption.</v>

690
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:31.590
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was writing tribe,</v>

691
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to make sense of a number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different number of different things.</v>

692
00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:40.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one was that what the soldiers I was </v>

693
00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:43.101
<v Speaker 3>with in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really struck some months later </v>

694
00:30:43.101 --> 00:30:43.650
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of them wanted to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of flea,</v>

695
00:30:43.651 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 3>bitten godforsaken outpost where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>got shot at it every day and didn't want</v>

696
00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:48.360
<v Speaker 3>to come home to the US.</v>

697
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like that needs explaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

698
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

699
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and it made me think of this uncle that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I had sort of surrogate uncle named </v>

700
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Ellis Ellis settle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

701
00:30:58.861 --> 00:31:03.861
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was Lakota Sioux and Apache is born </v>

702
00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:04.590
<v Speaker 3>in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29 out west.</v>

703
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.750
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a very rough,</v>

704
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.280
<v Speaker 3>interesting life and he's very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

705
00:31:08.281 --> 00:31:13.281
<v Speaker 3>And I remember him telling me he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of mentor figure for me and I </v>

706
00:31:13.281 --> 00:31:13.530
<v Speaker 3>remember him telling me when I was in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>

707
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.130
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

708
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.200
<v Speaker 3>all throughout the history of the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

709
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.780
<v Speaker 3>along the frontier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is how he put it.</v>

710
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:23.870
<v Speaker 3>He said white people were always running</v>
<v Speaker 3>off to join the Indians and the Indians </v>

711
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>never ran off to join the white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so here was this fact again,</v>

712
00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:28.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no one wants to go,</v>

713
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.040
<v Speaker 3>go back to or go to the sort of modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

714
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.950
<v Speaker 4>This wasn't even the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the modern world in 18,</v>

715
00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:35.280
<v Speaker 4>65,</v>

716
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.340
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or eight or 17,</v>

717
00:31:37.341 --> 00:31:38.570
<v Speaker 3>55 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at the,</v>

718
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.770
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

719
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right at the time it was the modern </v>

720
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

721
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so no one,</v>

722
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically the post agricultural,</v>

723
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:51.800
<v Speaker 3>really a revolution world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the industrial world,</v>

724
00:31:51.801 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 3>the world of organized religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organized government of,</v>

725
00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.230
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an industrial economy and an agriculture</v>

726
00:32:00.231 --> 00:32:04.100
<v Speaker 3>based system where people had jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got up at dawn and plowed the fields</v>

727
00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:09.101
<v Speaker 3>all day and went to bed and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>minister and your king told you what to </v>

728
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:09.101
<v Speaker 3>do and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

729
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what nobody wants to be part </v>

730
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.951
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the soldiers I was with at </v>

731
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:17.951
<v Speaker 3>Restrepo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

732
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:21.080
<v Speaker 3>And so it just made me think maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the soldiers are missing isn't war,</v>

733
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.440
<v Speaker 3>although that certainly has its charms </v>
<v Speaker 3>for some people,</v>

734
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's community is that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other community with </v>

735
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

736
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.050
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

737
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Community with consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Likewise for the native Americans were </v>

738
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the tribal societies in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe with the young men,</v>

739
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:42.310
<v Speaker 3>young men and some young women along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>were looking for was an escape from the </v>

740
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 3>sort of oppressiveness of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>congregation on Sunday mornings,</v>

741
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:51.461
<v Speaker 3>the oppressiveness of the society that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were toiling in the regimented </v>

742
00:32:51.461 --> 00:32:55.571
<v Speaker 3>nature of an agric agrarian society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe what they longed for was the </v>

743
00:32:55.571 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 3>closeness and freedom of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a tribal society.</v>

744
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 3>And indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

745
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:04.610
<v Speaker 3>there was this incredible sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemorrhaging of people from the frontier</v>

746
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:09.611
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the tribes and some and even when </v>

747
00:33:09.611 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 3>people were kidnapped on rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

748
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.880
<v Speaker 3>by the Indians kidnapped from their log </v>
<v Speaker 3>homes along the frontier and,</v>

749
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 3>and abducted and forcibly adopted into </v>
<v Speaker 3>these tribal societies.</v>

750
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

751
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 3>when given the chance to come home to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>repatriated some years later,</v>

752
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 3>very often these people refuse to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to go back,</v>

753
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to stay with their adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried their adopted community.</v>

754
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.820
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

755
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:41.110
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it says a lot about what the way </v>

756
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.110
<v Speaker 3>humans are wired to</v>

757
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.200
<v Speaker 4>wanted to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

758
00:33:41.201 --> 00:33:46.201
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the craziest aspects of </v>

759
00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:46.201
<v Speaker 4>your book that I'd never heard that </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

760
00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:47.230
<v Speaker 4>And how many people had done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

761
00:33:47.231 --> 00:33:52.231
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were kidnapped and then they said </v>

762
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:52.231
<v Speaker 4>we like it here better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

763
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

764
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.770
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about more than 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

765
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.800
<v Speaker 4>So we think of as modern society today </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the only escalated those anxieties </v>

766
00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 4>and woes and all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>separated them from the tribal world.</v>

767
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.970
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things about tribes is </v>

768
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.950
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are sort of inherently </v>

769
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:16.361
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It very hard to pass on pass on wealth </v>

770
00:34:16.361 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>and a non capitalist society in a mobile</v>
<v Speaker 3>nomadic society is impossible to pass on</v>

771
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 3>wealth because you can't carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

772
00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to carry wealth when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

773
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 3>when you're in a nomadic hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

774
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're very,</v>

775
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:33.770
<v Speaker 3>very egalitarian and they also guard </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the sort of abuses of power,</v>

776
00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 3>sort of one alpha male trying to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bully people and take more than his</v>

777
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:42.251
<v Speaker 3>share or for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sort of freeloading and not </v>

778
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 3>contributing to the group survival </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort and sort of scamming a little bit</v>

779
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 3>of food here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of whatever they're.</v>

780
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Both of those sins against the community</v>
<v Speaker 3>are really harshly punished.</v>

781
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:54.941
<v Speaker 3>So it's very galitary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ian and I got a Galitary aneurysm is </v>

782
00:34:54.941 --> 00:34:55.690
<v Speaker 3>something we are all wired for it.</v>

783
00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the distresses of a </v>

784
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 3>modern capitalist society is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be a Galitary and um,</v>

785
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:02.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

786
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's painful for people.</v>

787
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 3>But then if you introduce a crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

788
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.390
<v Speaker 3>the blitz in London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

789
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an earthquake in Italy that I studied,</v>

790
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that money doesn't </v>

791
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:16.160
<v Speaker 3>matter anymore when the floodwaters are </v>
<v Speaker 3>rising,</v>

792
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:21.161
<v Speaker 3>when the bombs are falling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social class doesn't matter at all in </v>

793
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like being in the,</v>

794
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 3>in the boxing gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you conduct yourself with respect to</v>

795
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 3>the others around you is actually what </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets evaluated in a,</v>

796
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a poor man can be brave and generous </v>

797
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 3>just as easily as a rich man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no advantage to being wealthy or</v>

798
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 3>powerful when it comes to those basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>human qualities.</v>

799
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.050
<v Speaker 3>And that is a huge liberation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm,</v>

800
00:35:42.051 --> 00:35:47.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in New York City and after nine </v>

801
00:35:47.051 --> 00:35:48.471
<v Speaker 3>slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bit of that in New York </v>

802
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:48.471
<v Speaker 3>City.</v>

803
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:48.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:48.471
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of more people in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

805
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:48.471
<v Speaker 3>a lot of rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

806
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we all know that,</v>

807
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 3>but after nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one was rich or poor or anything.</v>

808
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:57.231
<v Speaker 3>We were all New Yorkers wondering if </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was going to be another bomb </v>

809
00:35:57.231 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 3>dropped on us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically another attack on the city.</v>

810
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 3>So what happened in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide rate went down.</v>

811
00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the violent crime rate went down.</v>

812
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam vets in New York said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had pete,</v>

813
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:12.411
<v Speaker 3>who suffered from Ptsd said that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms disappeared after nine slash </v>

814
00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:16.821
<v Speaker 3>11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was needed and people and </v>

815
00:36:16.821 --> 00:36:19.191
<v Speaker 3>everyone for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was equal because we were all </v>

816
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 3>facing some danger that terrified us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for all of its tragedy,</v>

817
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 3>that is an intoxicating social state to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in for human beings.</v>

818
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.090
<v Speaker 4>That's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre,</v>

819
00:36:29.091 --> 00:36:34.091
<v Speaker 4>but it's also so make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I also thought </v>

820
00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:35.720
<v Speaker 4>was fascinating in your book where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about ptsd,</v>

821
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:40.810
<v Speaker 4>Ptsd sufferers and how people in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>veterans hospitals would be absolutely </v>

822
00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:45.230
<v Speaker 4>furious if they thought someone was </v>
<v Speaker 4>faking their symptoms and that,</v>

823
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to be physically restrained to </v>

824
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.751
<v Speaker 4>keep from attacking people that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought were just joking the system and </v>

825
00:36:52.751 --> 00:36:55.370
<v Speaker 4>how many people are on ptsd benefits.</v>

826
00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the numbers are really elusive,</v>

827
00:36:58.481 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

828
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:05.190
<v Speaker 3>you know what I have sort of anecdotally</v>
<v Speaker 3>from veterans as well as people within </v>

829
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.350
<v Speaker 3>the va,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Va administration who were acting as</v>

830
00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:13.351
<v Speaker 3>therapists or whatever a group </v>
<v Speaker 3>counselors is that there's certain </v>

831
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:13.351
<v Speaker 3>number of people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

832
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fraction is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain number of people </v>

833
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 3>who were not traumatized in war and ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>is hard to prove or disprove and it's,</v>

834
00:37:21.311 --> 00:37:24.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so obviously wide open for um,</v>

835
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 3>either an unintentional misdiagnosis or </v>
<v Speaker 3>an intentional misrepresentation,</v>

836
00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:32.590
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I mean,</v>

837
00:37:32.591 --> 00:37:34.840
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and any bureaucratic system gets scammed</v>

838
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 3>and pts deep benefits are no different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

839
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 3>but it really is traumatizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean seriously angering and </v>

840
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.021
<v Speaker 3>traumatizing to soldiers who really were</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatized because they really were in </v>

841
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:50.461
<v Speaker 3>combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And keep in mind only about 10 percent </v>

842
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:50.740
<v Speaker 3>of the US military experiences direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat.</v>

843
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 4>How would they know if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously traumatized?</v>

844
00:37:55.351 --> 00:38:00.351
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that's fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that as you were talking about in </v>

845
00:38:00.351 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 4>these small societies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free loaders are looked down upon as are</v>

846
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 4>the greedy Alpha males and try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominate the wealth like that.</v>

847
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 4>The in these societies like egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas are a much more,</v>

848
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.080
<v Speaker 4>much more openly expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's much more important that this is </v>

849
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Speaker 4>represented by these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately suffering.</v>

850
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Seeing someone was scamming the system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and angry.</v>

851
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Whereas say if you had a hurt knee or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that and you were going </v>

852
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.120
<v Speaker 4>to a doctor and you saw someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>faking a back injury,</v>

853
00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:35.121
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be upset right where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were just robbing money from the </v>

854
00:38:35.121 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 4>insurance company and getting free.</v>

855
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hurt knee doesn't have a sort </v>

856
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 3>of emotional cargo to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

857
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:45.691
<v Speaker 3>But combat does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're in combat and you lost </v>

858
00:38:45.691 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 3>your best buddy and you got trauma from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as well,</v>

859
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:48.130
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

860
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.090
<v Speaker 3>and then you're in some group therapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing at the va with some guy who was in</v>

861
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 3>a rear base the whole time and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>claiming 100 percent ptsd disability for</v>

862
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:57.880
<v Speaker 3>some that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

863
00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would make you angry.</v>

864
00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 3>It makes me angry because combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is extremely emotional and he get,</v>

865
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it one in a million?</v>

866
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 3>One in 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000.</v>

867
00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:11.251
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what the rates are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure what the va does and </v>

868
00:39:11.251 --> 00:39:11.280
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

869
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some ways incentivized not to find </v>

870
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

871
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

872
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you from like the real deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat vets that happens,</v>

873
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.791
<v Speaker 3>they smell it instantly and one way it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets sorted out is that those guys who </v>

874
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 3>are misrepresenting themselves get </v>
<v Speaker 3>questioned by the combat vets.</v>

875
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Holy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what unit were you with?</v>

876
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened exactly.</v>

877
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mortar hit the other side of the base.</v>

878
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty big base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been there,</v>

879
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:38.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a mile away and you're </v>

880
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:38.101
<v Speaker 3>traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding?</v>

881
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:38.101
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

882
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:38.101
<v Speaker 3>They'll get questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

883
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

884
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:40.900
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

885
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 3>my question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's bullshitting you about how</v>

886
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:47.851
<v Speaker 3>much you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much a fighting's done with MMA or </v>

887
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:47.851
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

888
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 3>wherever your area of expertise is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can smell a fraud </v>

889
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 3>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

890
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Well everyone can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things is one of the </v>

891
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.701
<v Speaker 3>characteristics of humans because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we live in collective societies </v>

892
00:39:59.701 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 3>where we have to sort of trust one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

893
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 3>We're extremely good at smelling out </v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresentation and fraud were really,</v>

894
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:09.031
<v Speaker 3>really good at it and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that feels intolerable is to have</v>

895
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:14.221
<v Speaker 3>someone who was unfairly gaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gaining from the hard work of the rest </v>

896
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 3>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

897
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I should just say,</v>

898
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 3>when I say a Galitary aneurysm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that there's no hierarchy.</v>

899
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

900
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Systems need hierarch need to order,</v>

901
00:40:24.281 --> 00:40:24.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need Heart.</v>

902
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean groups need hierarchy so that not</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's a general.</v>

903
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:33.031
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone's a private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you need organization within the </v>

904
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.730
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm Galitary Ian means that nobody </v>

905
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.040
<v Speaker 3>gets extra rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

906
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 3>like all have the basically the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights in the group.</v>

907
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:42.020
<v Speaker 3>That's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

908
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 4>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all completely makes sense.</v>

909
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:48.410
<v Speaker 4>It particularly makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that these people who were real</v>

910
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:53.411
<v Speaker 4>combat vets who saw real action would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously able to discern whether </v>

911
00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 4>or not someone was faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

912
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that this.</v>

913
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of mirrors what you were </v>

914
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 4>saying about these small tribes that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these small tribes,</v>

915
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.350
<v Speaker 4>someone who's a freeloader is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely dangerous to the group.</v>

916
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:11.870
<v Speaker 4>You'll look at it as a liability he </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at as someone who just can't be </v>

917
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 4>trusted and you need trust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need community.</v>

918
00:41:14.991 --> 00:41:19.991
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what you're saying about a </v>

919
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 4>combat troops that what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know is that you're going to be willing </v>

920
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 4>to put your own safety secondary to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>safety,</v>

921
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.900
<v Speaker 3>the troop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

922
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.600
<v Speaker 3>And if everyone does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is safer.</v>

923
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 3>But if</v>

924
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.930
<v Speaker 4>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if some one person doesn't do that,</v>

925
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always in the movies,</v>

926
00:41:34.281 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always the one guy who runs away or</v>

927
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 4>the one guy who sells out or.</v>

928
00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

929
00:41:40.651 --> 00:41:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

930
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.730
<v Speaker 3>those human themes are enduring and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>

931
00:41:44.731 --> 00:41:46.740
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes speak to a lot of liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>audiences,</v>

932
00:41:46.741 --> 00:41:47.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

933
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I,</v>

934
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I love doing this to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

935
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Democrat,</v>

936
00:41:51.991 --> 00:41:53.670
<v Speaker 3>so I sort of know those people pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

937
00:41:53.671 --> 00:41:55.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Massachusetts and I get it,</v>

938
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

939
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all,</v>

940
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:58.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

941
00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:03.141
<v Speaker 3>who hears it gets war and doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know anything or have anything to do </v>

942
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:03.141
<v Speaker 3>with war and Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

943
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:07.531
<v Speaker 3>Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course everyone raises their </v>

944
00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:07.531
<v Speaker 3>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

945
00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:07.531
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I say,</v>

946
00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:12.261
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who here has paid money to go be </v>

947
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:13.560
<v Speaker 3>entertained by a Hollywood war movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone raises their hand.</v>

948
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.400
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I go onto say to them is,</v>

949
00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:18.240
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

950
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.150
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if work and get a room full of passivist</v>

951
00:42:21.151 --> 00:42:23.680
<v Speaker 3>to go pay money to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

952
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.460
<v Speaker 3>there's something important going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that narrative.</v>

953
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to the movies to watch </v>

954
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 3>people get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

955
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.591
<v Speaker 3>You're not a sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to the movies to see these </v>

956
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:40.860
<v Speaker 3>very ancient human concerns of who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>loyal to the group,</v>

957
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.900
<v Speaker 3>who's a coward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's brave,</v>

958
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.180
<v Speaker 3>who's willing to risk their life for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>

959
00:42:45.181 --> 00:42:45.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

960
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.070
<v Speaker 3>these are things that have kept humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive or endangered them as the case may</v>

961
00:42:50.071 --> 00:42:54.390
<v Speaker 3>be for a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're compelling narratives.</v>

962
00:42:54.391 --> 00:42:59.391
<v Speaker 3>And in war you see those things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a sort of accelerated intense </v>

963
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.780
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

964
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a suburb.</v>

965
00:43:02.341 --> 00:43:07.341
<v Speaker 3>You almost never see someone have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose between their own safety and the </v>

966
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:07.341
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never happens.</v>

967
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:10.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with the suburbs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>war that happens every moment,</v>

968
00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.190
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

969
00:43:11.191 --> 00:43:16.191
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it gives you this sort of like human </v>

970
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:19.161
<v Speaker 3>narrative in this incredibly compressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>intense form which reconfirms the value,</v>

971
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the human values we all have about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

972
00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:24.810
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to love that group.</v>

973
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you disliked some of the people in </v>

974
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.631
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's what it means to be part of </v>

975
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:34.311
<v Speaker 3>a group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what has kept humans alive </v>

976
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:34.311
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>

977
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Even see that narrative in science </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiction,</v>

978
00:43:35.251 --> 00:43:37.660
<v Speaker 4>futuristic movies like the Matrix right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

979
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Speaker 4>the one guy who sells out the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans to the,</v>

980
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.870
<v Speaker 4>to the Matrix and just says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

981
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be in the matrix.</v>

982
00:43:45.301 --> 00:43:47.620
<v Speaker 4>I want to have a great life and eat good</v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

983
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:47.820
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

984
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

985
00:43:48.641 --> 00:43:49.300
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you,</v>

986
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.530
<v Speaker 3>once you are aware of this narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it everywhere and I mean,</v>

987
00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:58.531
<v Speaker 3>one part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some research that I did that </v>

988
00:43:58.531 --> 00:43:58.531
<v Speaker 3>didn't actually make it into the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't quite fit it in,</v>

989
00:43:58.531 --> 00:43:58.840
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

990
00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed someone who had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consulting firm in Hollywood that did </v>

991
00:44:04.331 --> 00:44:08.920
<v Speaker 3>basically sort of like market research </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the big studios and they would,</v>

992
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.550
<v Speaker 3>they would screen films for audiences </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then ask the audience's questions </v>

993
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.960
<v Speaker 3>about the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the characters,</v>

994
00:44:16.961 --> 00:44:21.961
<v Speaker 3>about how to construct the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would sort of trying to figure out </v>

995
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:21.961
<v Speaker 3>what's the public one is c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

996
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 3>So what they found was that in disaster </v>
<v Speaker 3>films,</v>

997
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.280
<v Speaker 3>very typically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

998
00:44:26.281 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Speaker 3>we're a community was facing a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disaster,</v>

999
00:44:29.201 --> 00:44:30.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A plague or uh,</v>

1000
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.230
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1001
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1002
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.250
<v Speaker 3>a flood or a war or whatever when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1003
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 3>when the community had to rally to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive,</v>

1004
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1005
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 3>An alien invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what does a million scenarios.</v>

1006
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:43.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's all the same basic story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have these different characters.</v>

1007
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:48.531
<v Speaker 3>There's usually a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a male figure that takes the lead to </v>

1008
00:44:48.531 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 3>difficulty defend the space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1009
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
<v Speaker 3>There is often a female figure that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to him that sort of takes </v>

1010
00:44:56.161 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 3>place of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the community that's being defended,</v>

1011
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes care of the dresses,</v>

1012
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 3>the wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dresses,</v>

1013
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 3>the emotional wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean turn takes care of all that stuff</v>

1014
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.510
<v Speaker 3>while the man or the men are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically defending the place there's.</v>

1015
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:17.780
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a guy who offered was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really wealthy or well off before the </v>

1016
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.581
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's continuing to act in a self </v>

1017
00:45:22.581 --> 00:45:25.521
<v Speaker 3>serving way even during the catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when everyone's needed and everybody </v>

1018
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 3>gets mad at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy always dies,</v>

1019
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 3>always dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another character.</v>

1020
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just very common in these </v>

1021
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 3>narratives and easily Beta male.</v>

1022
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1023
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1024
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1025
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 3>but keep in mind that these narratives </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Ford by public opinion or this isn't </v>

1026
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 3>the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trying to make the public,</v>

1027
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>

1028
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 3>feed the public like gender roles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1029
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever this is the public saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

1030
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:57.891
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the studios are responding to the </v>

1031
00:45:57.891 --> 00:45:57.891
<v Speaker 3>questionnaires that these researchers </v>
<v Speaker 3>give out.</v>

1032
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 3>So one of the really interesting things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is totally inflammatory,</v>

1033
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.730
<v Speaker 3>but the role of the person defending </v>
<v Speaker 3>like fizzle,</v>

1034
00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:11.731
<v Speaker 3>you physically defending the community </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they try to put a woman in that </v>

1035
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 3>role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have a problem with it and,</v>

1036
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:18.381
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and frankly often women have a problem </v>

1037
00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:18.381
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really,</v>

1038
00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting and women are just as</v>

1039
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 3>important as men in a crisis or in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1040
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:23.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1041
00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:28.971
<v Speaker 3>what the public seems to want is the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the sword and the woman with the </v>

1042
00:46:28.971 --> 00:46:29.440
<v Speaker 3>bandage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1043
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.750
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1044
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.150
<v Speaker 3>or with the sort of reassuring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1045
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.950
<v Speaker 3>like it gets divided like that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1046
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:39.951
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the studio's forcing something </v>

1047
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:42.531
<v Speaker 3>on people as the people watching these </v>
<v Speaker 3>films saying just voting on what the </v>

1048
00:46:42.531 --> 00:46:43.200
<v Speaker 3>narrative that they like best.</v>

1049
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other characters that I thought was </v>

1050
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 3>really hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's often that,</v>

1051
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.221
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an estranged husband who's betrayed his </v>

1052
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:52.221
<v Speaker 3>wife and family in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on the outs,</v>

1053
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1054
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 3>with his family and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his wife.</v>

1055
00:46:55.741 --> 00:47:00.741
<v Speaker 3>And then the crisis happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The martians invade the floodwaters </v>

1056
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:00.741
<v Speaker 3>rise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

1057
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And he comes to the rescue and does the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right thing and saves his wife and </v>

1058
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 3>family and maybe even the wife's new </v>
<v Speaker 3>boyfriend.</v>

1059
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean he even could have gotten to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

1060
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because he does the right thing,</v>

1061
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.690
<v Speaker 3>she takes him back.</v>

1062
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

1063
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:21.111
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really just playing out these </v>

1064
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:21.111
<v Speaker 3>ancient archetypes to exactly what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1065
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean they read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1066
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.050
<v Speaker 3>those storylines resonate because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're ancient and because those,</v>

1067
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.600
<v Speaker 3>those roles in society helped us </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

1068
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And there's always the woman who in </v>
<v Speaker 3>absence of the strong male figure rises </v>

1069
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 3>to the occasion herself when some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>research I did with tribe,</v>

1070
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.440
<v Speaker 3>what I found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied this coal mine disaster in </v>

1071
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was all men trapped a two O,</v>

1072
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 3>two miles down in these collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 3>passageways in the miles.</v>

1073
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Two miles down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two miles down a,</v>

1074
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 3>an angled shaft down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:56.971
<v Speaker 3>So they had an explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some gases ignited and the passageways </v>

1076
00:47:56.971 --> 00:47:58.970
<v Speaker 3>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're two miles in their gaslight.</v>

1077
00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1078
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their batteries.</v>

1079
00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:04.240
<v Speaker 3>24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their water last 48 hours.</v>

1081
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Pretty soon they're just sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness.</v>

1082
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Not Knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only if they'll survive,</v>

1083
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 3>not knowing if their bodies will ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>even be recovered,</v>

1084
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.710
<v Speaker 3>they no way waveness sitting in darkness</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying.</v>

1085
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 3>So whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>

1086
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes needs leadership.</v>

1087
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:23.910
<v Speaker 3>So in the first minutes and hours there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were these sort of Alpha males that </v>

1088
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 3>weren't necessarily crew bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1089
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:30.751
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't within the traditional </v>

1090
00:48:30.751 --> 00:48:32.551
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just guys who grabbed a pick </v>

1091
00:48:32.551 --> 00:48:32.551
<v Speaker 3>ax and a shovel and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on guys,</v>

1092
00:48:32.551 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 3>we're going to try to dig our way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they basically,</v>

1093
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally attacked the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these collapsed mine shafts.</v>

1094
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:44.780
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was too much rubble to dig </v>

1095
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:44.780
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were two miles down.</v>

1096
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:44.780
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1097
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:44.780
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1098
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.640
<v Speaker 3>they dig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dug and dug and dug and it required </v>

1099
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>

1100
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all men down there,</v>

1101
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 3>but there was one sort of leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was this very aggressive.</v>

1102
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 3>He didn't care what anyone else felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1103
00:48:56.651 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 3>you're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit.</v>

1104
00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Grab a shovel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to solve this problem.</v>

1105
00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Like totally unempathic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1106
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:09.090
<v Speaker 3>When they realized they couldn't dig </v>
<v Speaker 3>their way out and they ran out of </v>

1107
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 3>batteries and they're sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness,</v>

1108
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.670
<v Speaker 3>a new kind of leader was required and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was someone who was able to keep </v>

1109
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 3>people's spirits up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is empathic,</v>

1110
00:49:15.881 --> 00:49:17.580
<v Speaker 3>who listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy was really scared,</v>

1111
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.060
<v Speaker 3>was able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey listen man,</v>

1112
00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to be scared.</v>

1113
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:22.160
<v Speaker 3>We're all scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1114
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 3>that kind of voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of leadership.</v>

1115
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typically in society,</v>

1116
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 3>the male role would be the guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pickax attacking the problem.</v>

1117
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.200
<v Speaker 3>The female role would be the person sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like trying to keep the group </v>

1118
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 3>emotionally together and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1119
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 3>and functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1120
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.700
<v Speaker 3>but what happens in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a situation where there's all of one </v>

1121
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.651
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those gender roles will be filled no </v>

1122
00:49:49.651 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>

1123
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 3>It would just be filled by people of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same sex.</v>

1124
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:56.000
<v Speaker 3>So if it was all women down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1125
00:49:56.001 --> 00:50:01.001
<v Speaker 3>one woman would have grabbed the pickax </v>
<v Speaker 3>and taken on what would be typically </v>

1126
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 3>considered a quote male role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's female.</v>

1127
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 3>So the gender roles that society needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>to survive in adversity,</v>

1128
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 3>in war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in nature,</v>

1129
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.020
<v Speaker 3>in a collapsed coal mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It needs both gender roles,</v>

1130
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 3>but either sex can fill those roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1131
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:22.351
<v Speaker 3>And we will sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't matter who's male and </v>

1132
00:50:22.351 --> 00:50:22.351
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What matters to that?</v>

1133
00:50:22.351 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Those two basic kinds of leadership and </v>
<v Speaker 3>caretaking get taken care of.</v>

1134
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did those guys get out?</v>

1135
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.840
<v Speaker 3>They eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rescuers eventually got to them.</v>

1136
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 3>How long were they down there for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over a week.</v>

1137
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I might even been two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1138
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:38.130
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1139
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:39.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1140
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 3>eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can't remember.</v>

1141
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something,</v>

1142
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 3>it's something like a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1143
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.290
<v Speaker 3>how did they survive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean barely.</v>

1144
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1145
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1146
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 3>they ran out of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1147
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.600
<v Speaker 3>they were eating the bark off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>timbers.</v>

1148
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1149
00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the support structures,</v>

1150
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they were eating coal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1151
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 3>you can call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to.</v>

1152
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were drinking their own urine.</v>

1153
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1154
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1155
00:50:58.271 --> 00:50:59.180
<v Speaker 3>the guys died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1156
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 3>not everyone survived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one guy was trapped.</v>

1157
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 3>His arms trapped between two collapse </v>
<v Speaker 3>timbers and they were,</v>

1158
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:09.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a pretty lively conversation </v>

1159
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:12.101
<v Speaker 3>about and he was begging them to cut his</v>
<v Speaker 3>arm off so that he could at least be </v>

1160
00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:14.801
<v Speaker 3>free and there was a pretty lively </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with the other men in the </v>

1161
00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like did we do that or not?</v>

1162
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they decided not to do that.</v>

1163
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 3>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they had was an acs.</v>

1164
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we chopped his arm off and free him.</v>

1165
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 3>He might die from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1166
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.900
<v Speaker 3>And he was removed from where those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

1167
00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:28.520
<v Speaker 3>So he was lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing.</v>

1168
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:29.810
<v Speaker 3>He was lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1169
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:31.520
<v Speaker 3>cut my arm off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to join you guys.</v>

1170
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 3>And they didn't any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any died.</v>

1171
00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1172
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Amazing sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1174
00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Not to whatever to steer this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation too much,</v>

1175
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:50.741
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a microcosm in some ways for </v>

1176
00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:50.741
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1177
00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:54.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean every country is potentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a coal mine trying to figure </v>

1178
00:51:54.131 --> 00:51:54.131
<v Speaker 3>out how to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1179
00:51:54.131 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean the day before nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know like 9:11</v>

1180
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:56.340
<v Speaker 3>was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1181
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1182
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 3>and the only way for any group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1183
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.880
<v Speaker 3>whether you it's $330,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million or 18 people as it was in the </v>

1184
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.610
<v Speaker 3>coal mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way for any group of people </v>

1185
00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:11.610
<v Speaker 3>that to survive is to act collectively.</v>

1186
00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans don't survive in nature by </v>

1187
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.791
<v Speaker 3>themselves and so in that coal mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both kinds of people were needed.</v>

1188
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.060
<v Speaker 3>They happen to be all men but it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need it.</v>

1189
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1190
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Gender doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sex doesn't matter.</v>

1191
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.890
<v Speaker 3>They need to both kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They needed aggressive Alphas that </v>

1192
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:33.791
<v Speaker 3>attack the problem and didn't care how </v>
<v Speaker 3>people felt and were interested in like </v>

1193
00:52:33.791 --> 00:52:35.300
<v Speaker 3>strict law and order and the group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do this,</v>

1194
00:52:35.301 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do what I say is a survival.</v>

1195
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 3>You needed those kinds of people and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed the other kind like,</v>

1196
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be all right.</v>

1197
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Are you feeling okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>empathic person.</v>

1200
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 3>You needed that also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at the politics in this</v>

1201
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:58.181
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need both conservatism and </v>

1202
00:52:58.181 --> 00:52:58.181
<v Speaker 3>liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1203
00:52:58.181 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Speaker 3>You cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a completely conservative America</v>

1204
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:03.890
<v Speaker 3>will be well defended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1205
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.750
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to mess with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1206
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 3>America first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one will mess with us,</v>

1207
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 3>but what will let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will be left unaddressed is some of</v>

1208
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:14.560
<v Speaker 3>the internal dynamics of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1209
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 3>which is frankly not at the foremost of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative thought.</v>

1210
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean sort of racial disparity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic disparity and all that stuff.</v>

1211
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:27.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not at the foremost of the </v>

1213
00:53:27.161 --> 00:53:27.161
<v Speaker 3>conservative agenda and it shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to be,</v>

1214
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't need to be because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forefront of the liberal agenda.</v>

1215
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 3>And God forbid you have a country that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely run by liberals.</v>

1216
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 3>It'll get overrun immediately by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearest armed neighbor.</v>

1217
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you.</v>

1218
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Liberals just aren't wired that way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be suspicious of the world.</v>

1219
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.520
<v Speaker 3>But what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what liberals do quite well is to try to</v>

1220
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:49.360
<v Speaker 3>figure out a sort of system of fairness </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the group that gets it.</v>

1221
00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Know it's just tries to equalize things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get everyone to sort of participate </v>

1222
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.891
<v Speaker 3>in to be valued and taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean that it's all lovely,</v>

1223
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:02.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's needed also and so that </v>

1224
00:54:02.961 --> 00:54:04.920
<v Speaker 3>every country is at its best when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have both of those dynamics going on and</v>

1225
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 3>they're in a kind of dynamic tension </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other,</v>

1226
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:12.140
<v Speaker 3>but neither completely takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that breaks my heart </v>

1227
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 3>watching this country is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there's this idea on both sides,</v>

1228
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:19.671
<v Speaker 3>on the liberal side and on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative side that the other not </v>

1229
00:54:19.671 --> 00:54:22.341
<v Speaker 3>only is totally wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's totally immoral and shouldn't </v>

1230
00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:22.341
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1231
00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:26.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just not true in this country is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to find peace until both sides</v>

1232
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 3>of the political equation sort of reach </v>
<v Speaker 3>across and shake the other person's hand</v>

1233
00:54:31.231 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1234
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.480
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you on almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1235
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:36.360
<v Speaker 3>but I'm glad you're with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need you and I need to because I don't</v>

1236
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:41.361
<v Speaker 3>think like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need you to think like you do and </v>

1237
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 3>until this country figures out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1238
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:46.521
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be in this sort of awful </v>
<v Speaker 3>partisans strife that eventually will </v>

1239
00:54:46.521 --> 00:54:50.571
<v Speaker 3>destroy us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bullets are not going to take down </v>

1240
00:54:50.571 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 3>this country words well and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be our words and it just breaks</v>

1241
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:55.440
<v Speaker 3>my heart to see this dynamic not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on and on,</v>

1242
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but getting</v>

1243
00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.560
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

1244
00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.240
<v Speaker 4>It does seem to be getting worse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

1245
00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:03.241
<v Speaker 4>And what's seems to be new is the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the liberals to silence people on </v>

1246
00:55:03.641 --> 00:55:07.090
<v Speaker 4>the right and to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think that free speech is important.</v>

1247
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:11.770
<v Speaker 4>What's important is their ideas and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>their ideas are especially.</v>

1248
00:55:11.771 --> 00:55:16.771
<v Speaker 4>I think now that trump is president and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people feel even more emboldened</v>

1249
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.150
<v Speaker 3>locked up in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1250
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.720
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1251
00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:21.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean honestly,</v>

1252
00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it's equally both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1253
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.200
<v Speaker 3>But I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1254
00:55:24.201 --> 00:55:26.510
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the right with the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1255
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.650
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Democrat,</v>

1256
00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:28.370
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1257
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I love evaluating my own size problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they drive me.</v>

1258
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:34.460
<v Speaker 3>They make me more upset than the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing's problems,</v>

1259
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because because they're my people.</v>

1260
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1261
00:55:36.741 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>

1262
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 3>can you act a little better?</v>

1263
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:44.320
<v Speaker 4>Pleased to see the irony though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've chosen a tribe and that </v>

1264
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.400
<v Speaker 4>tribe of people that you don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these people are just.</v>

1265
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.550
<v Speaker 4>It's a political tribe.</v>

1266
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1267
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:48.080
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1268
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I share those political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those political ideals and the </v>

1269
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>conservative ideals I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't share,</v>

1270
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 3>but I would hate to live in a country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't have conservatives in it </v>

1271
00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.950
<v Speaker 3>even though I disagree because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with them.</v>

1272
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be surrounded by people </v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with.</v>

1273
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are conservatives to do not </v>

1274
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:07.600
<v Speaker 3>want liberals in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1275
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Shame on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1276
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.960
<v Speaker 3>And likewise for liberals come in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and on both sides.</v>

1277
00:56:10.961 --> 00:56:15.580
<v Speaker 3>So I think both sides tried to silence </v>
<v Speaker 3>the voices of the other side.</v>

1278
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1279
00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1280
00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's committed equally on both</v>

1281
00:56:18.851 --> 00:56:21.820
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I wanted to bring up,</v>

1282
00:56:21.821 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 3>because I actually made mistake last </v>
<v Speaker 3>time I was on your on your show,</v>

1283
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned a book and I got the name </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and it's such a good book and I </v>

1284
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 3>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw on twitter that people trying</v>

1285
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 3>to find it and they couldn't because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got the name rock,</v>

1286
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.600
<v Speaker 3>it's called our political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our political nature,</v>

1287
00:56:35.601 --> 00:56:40.240
<v Speaker 3>and by a guy named Avi Tushman and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>collected an awful lot of data about the</v>

1288
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:45.241
<v Speaker 3>fact that political opinion is about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent determined by genetics.</v>

1289
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you inherit about half of your political</v>

1290
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 3>opinion and the other half is acquired </v>
<v Speaker 3>through experience,</v>

1291
00:56:53.801 --> 00:56:56.170
<v Speaker 3>through exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you grew up in a liberal family,</v>

1292
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting you probably you're,</v>

1293
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.720
<v Speaker 3>you're about 50 percent likely to wind </v>
<v Speaker 3>up being a liberal because you absorb </v>

1294
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 3>though that way of seeing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm a Democrat,</v>

1295
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 3>if I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grown up in a conservative family,</v>

1296
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think having read this </v>

1297
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:17.191
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm actually a genetic </v>

1298
00:57:17.191 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 3>conservative that adopted liberal values</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of my environment.</v>

1299
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic liberals who have adopted </v>

1300
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:23.880
<v Speaker 3>conservative values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it.</v>

1301
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.870
<v Speaker 3>It's about 50 slash 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is,</v>

1302
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>so it's Avi Tishman our political </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

1303
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it wrong.</v>

1304
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to correct that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point of this to me is that,</v>

1305
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.480
<v Speaker 3>and he knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean scientists know this because when</v>

1306
00:57:37.481 --> 00:57:42.481
<v Speaker 3>they look at identical twins that share </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of their DNA,</v>

1307
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 3>identical twins later in life are far </v>
<v Speaker 3>more likely to have the same political </v>

1308
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 3>opinion than fraternal twins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which don't share all their DNA.</v>

1309
00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.080
<v Speaker 3>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1310
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 3>so that's how they know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they looked at identical twins,</v>

1311
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 3>there's a much higher concordance of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political opinion later in life than for</v>

1312
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:01.840
<v Speaker 3>fraternal twins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they know that it's around 50</v>

1313
00:58:01.841 --> 00:58:04.990
<v Speaker 3>percent of your political view is </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined by genetics.</v>

1314
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 3>If it's determined by genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means it had survival value.</v>

1315
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:14.011
<v Speaker 3>That means that liberalism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism both had survival value in </v>

1316
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 3>our evolutionary past and is as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>result,</v>

1317
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:22.201
<v Speaker 3>has become encoded in our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like other behaviors like generosity,</v>

1318
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 3>other character traits like generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courage,</v>

1319
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are all encoded in our DNA because</v>

1320
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 3>they had survival value will likewise </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism and liberalism,</v>

1321
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:35.941
<v Speaker 3>which means that in the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discussion in this country about </v>

1322
00:58:35.941 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can disagree with people,</v>

1323
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 3>go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy comes out of disagreement and </v>

1324
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.271
<v Speaker 3>compromise is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you cannot do is point your </v>

1325
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 3>finger across the aisle and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only are you wrong but you shouldn't</v>

1326
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:50.230
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like go away,</v>

1327
00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:50.920
<v Speaker 3>disappear.</v>

1328
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.920
<v Speaker 3>You're not part of what America is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that assertion is completely </v>

1329
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 3>contradictory to evolution and if and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's contradicted your evolution,</v>

1330
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 3>it won't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that people have a really</v>

1331
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:05.980
<v Speaker 3>difficult time managing conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even managing verbal conflict,</v>

1332
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 3>that when someone disagrees with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to silence that person.</v>

1333
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:13.981
<v Speaker 3>They want to yell at that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to scream and they they think </v>

1334
00:59:13.981 --> 00:59:16.501
<v Speaker 3>about their own thoughts rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting themselves in the position of </v>

1335
00:59:16.501 --> 00:59:19.341
<v Speaker 3>the other person or objectively </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that there is an important </v>

1336
00:59:19.341 --> 00:59:19.870
<v Speaker 3>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd both.</v>

1337
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>It's important to have both sides.</v>

1338
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:27.370
<v Speaker 4>It's important to even be challenged on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ideas so you can solidify what's </v>

1339
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:29.510
<v Speaker 4>the root cause of your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

1340
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:30.990
<v Speaker 4>where were they coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1341
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1342
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.240
<v Speaker 4>how much have you examined these ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you just married to them because </v>

1343
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.681
<v Speaker 4>they were given to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are these things you've adopted or are </v>

1344
00:59:41.681 --> 00:59:45.551
<v Speaker 4>these really well considered thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've put through the mill?</v>

1345
00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1346
00:59:46.801 --> 00:59:48.840
<v Speaker 3>the thing is there were rules to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contests,</v>

1347
00:59:48.841 --> 00:59:49.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1348
00:59:49.351 --> 00:59:51.300
<v Speaker 3>there are rules and MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1349
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:55.170
<v Speaker 3>There are rules and boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were rules in marriages,</v>

1350
00:59:55.171 --> 00:59:55.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>

1351
00:59:55.901 --> 01:00:00.901
<v Speaker 3>you would never stay in a marriage where</v>
<v Speaker 3>your spouse treated you the way the </v>

1352
01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:03.930
<v Speaker 3>political parties treat each other right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1353
01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:05.700
<v Speaker 3>You would never stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1354
01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:07.560
<v Speaker 3>there's incredibly contemptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mocking,</v>

1355
01:00:07.561 --> 01:00:10.160
<v Speaker 3>disparaging tone that both sides have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

1356
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Outta here.</v>

1357
01:00:11.431 --> 01:00:16.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife clearly just thinks I'm a </v>

1358
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:16.431
<v Speaker 3>complete dirt bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or no one had talked.</v>

1359
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:18.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't talk to someone like that that</v>

1360
01:00:18.121 --> 01:00:19.860
<v Speaker 3>you have any respect for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1361
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think no one would stay in a marriage </v>

1362
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>like that and what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is new,</v>

1363
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1364
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't grow up with this.</v>

1365
01:00:26.551 --> 01:00:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a new thing where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political parties talk to each other.</v>

1366
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement is great,</v>

1367
01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come from,</v>

1368
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want eventually you compromise and </v>

1369
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:38.520
<v Speaker 3>you figure something out where nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>

1370
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:38.520
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:38.790
<v Speaker 3>the machine goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1372
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.800
<v Speaker 3>The ship sails on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's new now is this content and it </v>

1373
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:47.490
<v Speaker 3>toxic in marriage and it's toxic in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>country too.</v>

1374
01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:49.170
<v Speaker 3>And this is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1375
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.820
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1376
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:55.970
<v Speaker 3>if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really take in the reality that </v>

1377
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:59.700
<v Speaker 3>this truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that half of our political opinions are </v>

1378
01:00:59.700 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 3>genetically wired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get rid of the contempt,</v>

1379
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1380
01:01:00.931 --> 01:01:03.270
<v Speaker 3>it's part of what we are as most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are aware of that.</v>

1381
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not right.</v>

1382
01:01:04.171 --> 01:01:05.370
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1383
01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1384
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.430
<v Speaker 3>and Congress plays on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1385
01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:13.431
<v Speaker 3>It's a great campaign strategy to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>say things that are hateful things about</v>

1386
01:01:14.251 --> 01:01:16.200
<v Speaker 3>the other side and consolidate your </v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

1387
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And if you consult in both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this right,</v>

1388
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:23.770
<v Speaker 3>and if you consolidate your base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're more likely to win the </v>

1389
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:26.991
<v Speaker 3>election you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a more solid political </v>

1390
01:01:26.991 --> 01:01:27.870
<v Speaker 3>position so they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know behavior,</v>

1391
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:30.330
<v Speaker 3>behavioral psychologists will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that one way to,</v>

1392
01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:30.990
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1393
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 3>make a group cohere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it a closed ranks and strengthened </v>

1394
01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:41.931
<v Speaker 3>its group commitment to itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One way to do that is to introduce an </v>

1395
01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:45.291
<v Speaker 3>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when there's no enemy groups </v>

1396
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.100
<v Speaker 3>naturally disperse because people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>go off to do their individual thing.</v>

1397
01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1398
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:49.830
<v Speaker 3>you have the freedom to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no threat anywhere.</v>

1399
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Introduce a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1400
01:01:51.511 --> 01:01:54.720
<v Speaker 3>everyone's in a group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what politicians do is they,</v>

1401
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they create a threat where there is </v>

1402
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1403
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 3>they say that other political party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually trying to destroy </v>

1404
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.650
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not part of the democracy.</v>

1405
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:07.470
<v Speaker 3>They're actually trying to destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to destroy this country.</v>

1406
01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing happened at the beginning</v>

1407
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:12.540
<v Speaker 3>of the Spanish civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father grew up in Spain and I studied</v>

1408
01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:13.860
<v Speaker 3>this matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war quite a lot.</v>

1409
01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.730
<v Speaker 3>The democratic reforms that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were coming in the thirties,</v>

1410
01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just land things like,</v>

1411
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vote for women,</v>

1412
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:21.800
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1413
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:26.810
<v Speaker 3>pretty normal things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were a threat to the power </v>

1414
01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 3>structure in Spain and the military and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1415
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far right in Spain,</v>

1416
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 3>the fascist basically said that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic reforms where people who were</v>

1417
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 3>trying to destroy Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you create an enemy that consolidates</v>

1418
01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 3>your power and you go on to win the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>

1419
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 3>It's great campaign strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just terrible for the nation.</v>

1420
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1421
01:02:43.991 --> 01:02:46.360
<v Speaker 2>lock her up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock her up.</v>

1422
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.220
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when trump was running,</v>

1423
01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:49.180
<v Speaker 2>that was the big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1424
01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:52.060
<v Speaker 2>The enemy that yet this was the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was Hillary Clinton.</v>

1425
01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:57.061
<v Speaker 2>She represented the evil Democrats who </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been stealing and robbing and</v>

1426
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:58.420
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1427
01:02:58.421 --> 01:02:59.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen,</v>

1428
01:02:59.351 --> 01:03:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement with Democrats.</v>

1429
01:03:01.721 --> 01:03:06.721
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a different matters say that </v>

1430
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:09.001
<v Speaker 3>they're actually antithetical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats are antithetical to free </v>

1431
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:09.870
<v Speaker 3>democratic ideals,</v>

1432
01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:15.270
<v Speaker 2>but just seems to meet to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a good party right now that </v>

1433
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans are mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Democrats are a mess.</v>

1434
01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they both suck,</v>

1435
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>so reform them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1436
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or creative work,</v>

1437
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>isn't there also an issue with just </v>
<v Speaker 2>having two sides,</v>

1438
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having the Yankees versus the red sox </v>

1439
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>every year in the world series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those two sides,</v>

1440
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I just</v>

1441
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 3>do represent the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetic strains in our liberal and </v>

1442
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1443
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.580
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to break down one way or </v>

1444
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:39.580
<v Speaker 3>another in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1445
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.210
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1446
01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:45.211
<v Speaker 3>it is sort of a binary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean our brains are sort of binary in </v>

1447
01:03:45.211 --> 01:03:45.211
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1448
01:03:45.211 --> 01:03:48.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean as humans surviving the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to defend your group and you </v>

1449
01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 3>need fairness within the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1450
01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.140
<v Speaker 3>the two things you have to do to survive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and remain a group.</v>

1451
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1452
01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:59.020
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so those tasks have been sort of </v>

1453
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.921
<v Speaker 3>like subcontracted out to conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>into liberals and it's been that way for</v>

1454
01:04:02.351 --> 01:04:07.351
<v Speaker 3>a very long time and you can even see </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those same behaviors like </v>

1455
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>insearch in chimpanzee society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1456
01:04:07.391 --> 01:04:09.490
<v Speaker 3>So this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very ancient behavior.</v>

1457
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:15.030
<v Speaker 3>So like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you have to grips with it </v>

1458
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.810
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that the two groups have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>act so a bismal with each other.</v>

1459
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:21.810
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really think that if you want to </v>

1460
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:21.810
<v Speaker 3>save the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to sort of save this country</v>

1461
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:22.780
<v Speaker 3>morally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politically,</v>

1462
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.330
<v Speaker 3>nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

1463
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1464
01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 3>really what you need is a bipartisan </v>
<v Speaker 3>committee in Congress that calls people </v>

1465
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:37.291
<v Speaker 3>out and calls them out for doing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying things that undermine our sense </v>

1466
01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:43.171
<v Speaker 3>of unity as a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Democrats say he's not my </v>

1467
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:46.561
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that undermines the understanding of </v>

1468
01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 3>what democracy is easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

1469
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Like he got voted in man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what happens in a democracy </v>

1470
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:54.070
<v Speaker 3>is the guy you didn't vote for ends up </v>
<v Speaker 3>being your president.</v>

1471
01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:56.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what a democracy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just deal with it,</v>

1472
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>

1473
01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I hate that I'm a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for him.</v>

1474
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:02.440
<v Speaker 3>But I hate when people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And likewise,</v>

1475
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 3>when Donald trump sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when citizen trump was accusing Barack </v>

1476
01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I understand not liking Obama,</v>

1477
01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care if you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or don't like him,</v>

1478
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.160
<v Speaker 3>but when citizen trump accused Barack </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama of not being a citizen and gop </v>

1479
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.730
<v Speaker 3>didn't repudiate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1480
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:22.390
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>

1481
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Citizen trump was telling every veteran </v>
<v Speaker 3>and soldier fighting overseas that their</v>

1482
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 3>commander in chief was an imposter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a fraud,</v>

1483
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 3>was not an American citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and has usurped the White House,</v>

1484
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:41.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a terribly destructive thing to </v>

1485
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 3>tell men and women in uniform or in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trench getting shot at,</v>

1486
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:48.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the gop like the DNC with this </v>

1487
01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:48.270
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not my president thing,</v>

1488
01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:51.610
<v Speaker 3>that the DNC is not rejecting that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let people say it,</v>

1489
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 3>they don't denounce it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1490
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.440
<v Speaker 3>The gop never repudiated that stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that trump came along with and for </v>

1491
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 3>the good of the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both had to write.</v>

1492
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.280
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't a free speech issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has the right legal right to </v>

1493
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 3>make a fool of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go for it.</v>

1494
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.920
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean the two political </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties have to stay silent in the face </v>

1495
01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 3>of things that are completely toxic to </v>
<v Speaker 3>our democracy.</v>

1496
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:17.311
<v Speaker 3>And they really should have spoken out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think some kind of bipartisan </v>

1497
01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:20.671
<v Speaker 3>commission in Congress that would call </v>
<v Speaker 3>out those are the worst outrageous and </v>

1498
01:06:20.671 --> 01:06:25.021
<v Speaker 3>calling the political parties to </v>
<v Speaker 3>denounce them that that would be </v>

1499
01:06:25.021 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 3>enormously positive thing in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1500
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>

1501
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.100
<v Speaker 4>but I think it would take a truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>exceptional person to look at the other </v>

1502
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.780
<v Speaker 4>side's faults and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not capitalize on it,</v>

1503
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1504
01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:38.230
<v Speaker 4>and especially even if it's a false </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing like the Obama thing with,</v>

1505
01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:43.490
<v Speaker 4>with trump or any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any number of things you could find in </v>

1506
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:45.810
<v Speaker 4>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it seems to me like this is like the</v>

1507
01:06:45.811 --> 01:06:50.811
<v Speaker 4>perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was ever going to be a time </v>

1508
01:06:50.811 --> 01:06:51.420
<v Speaker 4>where a third party with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>centrist type party would come around,</v>

1509
01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:54.330
<v Speaker 4>this would be the perfect time where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are so.</v>

1510
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.240
<v Speaker 4>And we also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people recognize that what we're</v>

1511
01:06:57.241 --> 01:07:02.241
<v Speaker 4>seeing on the right and the left in </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to Hillary Clinton or Donald </v>

1512
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Trump is you're seeing people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretending to be this thing right?</v>

1513
01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 4>With Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a lifelong Democrat.</v>

1514
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.450
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican.</v>

1515
01:07:09.451 --> 01:07:12.840
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about God and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just like,</v>

1516
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:17.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a little dog and pony show on the </v>

1517
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.941
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And on the left you've got this woman </v>

1518
01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:20.550
<v Speaker 4>who was part of the Clinton Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were essentially,</v>

1519
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 4>it was a pay to play scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were making millions of dollars and</v>

1520
01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:29.061
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousand dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit speeches that they would give </v>

1521
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:29.061
<v Speaker 4>to the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is not some sort of a,</v>

1522
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:34.190
<v Speaker 4>a real liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not a that the ideas that you </v>

1523
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>were embracing about liberal values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1524
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.560
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1525
01:07:36.561 --> 01:07:41.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean the two parties basically have </v>
<v Speaker 3>become sort of cartels to keep </v>

1526
01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:41.561
<v Speaker 3>themselves in power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1527
01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:42.480
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way to pray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1528
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.210
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1529
01:07:45.211 --> 01:07:50.211
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary was absolutely part of that on </v>

1530
01:07:50.211 --> 01:07:50.211
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

1531
01:07:50.211 --> 01:07:50.570
<v Speaker 3>on the left and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1532
01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:55.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it's antithetical to the highest </v>

1533
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.641
<v Speaker 3>ideals of the framers of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution and the people that </v>

1534
01:07:58.641 --> 01:07:59.030
<v Speaker 3>established this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in and I,</v>

1535
01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear you about the centrist party.</v>

1536
01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:01.580
<v Speaker 3>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>

1537
01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1538
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.220
<v Speaker 3>the way the power structure works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the cartels work is they got </v>

1539
01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:07.220
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have access to all the funds,</v>

1540
01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the money,</v>

1541
01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:08.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you,</v>

1542
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.560
<v Speaker 3>where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you get the money for something</v>

1543
01:08:10.561 --> 01:08:14.400
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to build something from scratch</v>

1544
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>and get to speed and in</v>

1545
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>time to win an election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

1546
01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>very hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the very least,</v>

1547
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a centrist party could fall prey to that</v>

1548
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:24.070
<v Speaker 1>kind of toxic rhetoric as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1549
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like there should be norms </v>
<v Speaker 1>where freedom of speech is an absolute.</v>

1550
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get it,</v>

1551
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but that the parties don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a moral obligation to denounce</v>

1552
01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>things that they know undermine than </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity of this country.</v>

1553
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean people in disagreement with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

1554
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean a basic level of respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person's personhood,</v>

1555
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:51.790
<v Speaker 1>for their citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their right to participate in the </v>

1556
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:54.251
<v Speaker 1>democratic process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when somebody accuses the president </v>

1557
01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:54.251
<v Speaker 1>of not being a citizen of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically saying,</v>

1558
01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't respect the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1559
01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:57.250
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1560
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the entire system is a lie and,</v>

1561
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even think Donald Trump </v>

1562
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.950
<v Speaker 1>thought it was true.</v>

1563
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a tactic and that the gop</v>
<v Speaker 1>never called that out is really </v>

1564
01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:13.390
<v Speaker 1>shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think he thought it was true </v>

1565
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.951
<v Speaker 1>that the Obama was actually born in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya because I think he did because I </v>

1566
01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:19.571
<v Speaker 1>know that he's really good friends with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones and talks to him all the </v>

1567
01:09:19.571 --> 01:09:22.631
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he believes a lot of very wacky </v>

1568
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:22.631
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:22.631
<v Speaker 1>I think he starts out believing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1570
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 1>by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1571
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>does he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1572
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 1>did he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1573
01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 1>he did it for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people did believe it though.</v>

1574
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>

1575
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.390
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is he was doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked.</v>

1576
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:37.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a pragmatist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I really like about </v>

1577
01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:37.420
<v Speaker 1>him in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hate,</v>

1578
01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I find him sort of a moral in the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it gives me the chills,</v>

1579
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a pragmatist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1580
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's completely capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocating a position that he doesn't </v>

1581
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:52.211
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he needs to believe </v>

1582
01:09:52.211 --> 01:09:52.211
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1583
01:09:52.211 --> 01:09:52.211
<v Speaker 1>enough people believe in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is working for me.</v>

1584
01:09:52.211 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 1>What was the benefit for him even </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing that idea down?</v>

1585
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't running for president back </v>

1586
01:09:59.620 --> 01:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think he was thinking?</v>

1587
01:09:59.620 --> 01:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he's been on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was considering it for a long</v>

1588
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.571
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was doing it to sort of </v>

1589
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:04.571
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate to Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1590
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:04.571
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to see,</v>

1591
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>see if this immigration stuff also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1592
01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he believes in that stuff,</v>

1593
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:08.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>

1594
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:13.990
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what he figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>very astutely as he identified a </v>

1595
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>democratic demographic that feels like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's getting overrun by </v>

1596
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1597
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics don't bear that out,</v>

1598
01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 1>but people feel that way and people feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1599
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 1>They vote that way and he figured that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1600
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1601
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to it,</v>

1602
01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1603
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not questioning his.</v>

1604
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1605
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:35.770
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing that I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1606
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.840
<v Speaker 1>please don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm undermines the nation's sense </v>

1607
01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:42.610
<v Speaker 1>of unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1608
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the crucial thing.</v>

1609
01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:49.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's keeping us safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world is that we're a unified </v>

1610
01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:50.120
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you disparage the courts,</v>

1611
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're splitting the country apart,</v>

1612
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>then the intelligence agencies don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1613
01:10:56.130 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're drilling holes in your </v>

1614
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>own boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1615
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Are you astonished that all that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can do that,</v>

1616
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.220
<v Speaker 1>that he can disparage the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>

1617
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 1>that he could disparage the courts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one calls him out.</v>

1618
01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 1>No one says this is fucking outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>

1619
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Especially knowing all of his campaigns </v>
<v Speaker 1>ties to Russia that are coming out</v>

1620
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more so.</v>

1621
01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1622
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1623
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.240
<v Speaker 3>some processes happening that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually catch up with him.</v>

1624
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

1625
01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it's gonna turn out.</v>

1626
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Am I surprised?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1627
01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:25.920
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised.</v>

1628
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:30.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm also surprised that the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1629
01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:35.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within my lifetime went from being a </v>

1630
01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:35.091
<v Speaker 3>party that was deeply concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>

1631
01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 3>with the working poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1632
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:37.690
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1633
01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.550
<v Speaker 3>with people working in factories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1634
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Those are at least the highest ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1635
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:48.140
<v Speaker 3>In my lifetime they went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they became a completely elitist </v>

1636
01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:51.741
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't give a shit about those </v>

1637
01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:51.741
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1638
01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that surprises me too.</v>

1639
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So along comes Bernie Sanders who,</v>

1640
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:55.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1641
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever his issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1642
01:11:56.451 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 3>he's least sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1643
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>At least you trust the guy like that guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking his mind.</v>

1644
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:07.190
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's speaking his mind like he's not </v>

1645
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:07.190
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

1646
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.020
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have these awful poll tested </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions like Hillary did and Jeb did.</v>

1647
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And all those guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1648
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:11.860
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1649
01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think.</v>

1650
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1651
01:12:14.881 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 3>how people react on this is as Martin </v>
<v Speaker 3>Luther said,</v>

1652
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:19.080
<v Speaker 3>here I stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do no other.</v>

1653
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:21.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of places that trump stands,</v>

1654
01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I actually,</v>

1655
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually impressed by his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say something no matter what the </v>

1656
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:28.160
<v Speaker 3>repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of cool.</v>

1657
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is definitely a first,</v>

1658
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1659
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean at the debate when he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Hillary Clinton and I forget what </v>

1660
01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>exactly what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1661
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said because you'd be in jail and</v>

1662
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 3>the whole place went crazy.</v>

1663
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Like who the fuck has ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't central debate.</v>

1664
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.270
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing in a work that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 3>like my house kind of off to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I disagree with him.</v>

1666
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:51.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost every political point that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>says he holds.</v>

1667
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got to say like,</v>

1668
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 3>like it worked and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an essay and I was talking about</v>

1669
01:12:56.701 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of courage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of physical courage,</v>

1670
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:00.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1671
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:05.830
<v Speaker 3>and I mean lives are literally being </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous in the face of harm to your </v>

1672
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:06.870
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like trump is,</v>

1673
01:13:06.871 --> 01:13:11.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a bit of a bully and I think that </v>

1674
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:11.871
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullies and cowards are sort of the same</v>

1675
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:11.871
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1676
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:13.690
<v Speaker 3>They're just two different sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same character trait.</v>

1677
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not all trump is.</v>

1678
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 3>He's actually morally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's actually very courageous.</v>

1679
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not a moral coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will say exactly what he thinks,</v>

1680
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:26.580
<v Speaker 3>no matter what the opinion's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1681
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 3>He has extreme confidence in who he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>or he doesn't give a shit,</v>

1682
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:30.720
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1683
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 3>that's moral courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like this is what I believe and I'm </v>

1684
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 3>going to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if I don't win,</v>

1685
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if I go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I stand for,</v>

1686
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:42.501
<v Speaker 3>I can do no other Martin simply could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have is elitist mentality because he </v>

1687
01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:46.130
<v Speaker 3>does believe that he's above a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the repercussions for saying these </v>

1688
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people who are elitists are</v>

1689
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:52.131
<v Speaker 3>cowards and this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I disagree with trump on just about </v>

1690
01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:52.131
<v Speaker 3>all of his policies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1691
01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 3>But the thing I do kind of have to tip </v>
<v Speaker 3>my hat to his head.</v>

1692
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:56.410
<v Speaker 3>He's not a moral coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He works.</v>

1693
01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:59.430
<v Speaker 3>He will say thing that every political </v>
<v Speaker 3>pundit in the world will say,</v>

1694
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to get,</v>

1695
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.240
<v Speaker 3>that's going to destroy you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to attack John Mccain and </v>

1696
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.620
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna hope to win the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>nomination and you're fucking crazy.</v>

1697
01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 3>And he did it and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he attacked him for being captured.</v>

1698
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>

1699
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think trump truly feels that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't agree with them.</v>

1700
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 1>But I do respect the fact that he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in the face of all political advice.</v>

1701
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it because he believed it.</v>

1702
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>That's moral courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just disagree with his opinions.</v>

1703
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>But I that moral courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people have it.</v>

1704
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>He has it and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he used it to unify the country </v>

1705
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:40.290
<v Speaker 1>and he's still splitting the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thing has any desire to unify </v>

1706
01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very self serving.</v>

1707
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1708
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think hilary did either,</v>

1709
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and none.</v>

1710
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the problem with our pool </v>

1711
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>parties right now is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving themselves before they serve the</v>

1712
01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:50.490
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1713
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it speaks to what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about in your book that no one is </v>

1714
01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.130
<v Speaker 1>looking at this like a real tribe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1715
01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:02.550
<v Speaker 1>an enormous tribe of 350 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no one person that's </v>

1716
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 1>standing out as a real leader and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least what Obama was,</v>

1717
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you agree with his policies and </v>

1718
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.231
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot that I don't agree with is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in where the way flip </v>

1719
01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:14.770
<v Speaker 1>flopped about whistleblowers and freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the press,</v>

1720
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 1>those things disturb me greatly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how intelligent he is.</v>

1721
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I know he's a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a statesman though.</v>

1722
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really came across as a guy who you </v>

1723
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1724
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:28.891
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy should be the fucking </v>

1725
01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:28.891
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sounds like the president.</v>

1726
01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:28.891
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1727
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 1>he has a fantastic vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks clearly.</v>

1728
01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:35.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>

1729
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 1>he's a highly honed human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1730
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1731
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1732
01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1733
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>there are things I didn't like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>that about him,</v>

1734
01:15:44.241 --> 01:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but absolutely as a,</v>

1735
01:15:45.621 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 1>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he brought a huge,</v>

1736
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought he brought a huge sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitas and dignity to the office.</v>

1737
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1738
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:58.260
<v Speaker 1>definitely without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He mean he was probably one of the best </v>

1739
01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.500
<v Speaker 1>ever at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that what we need now,</v>

1740
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is someone who genuinely wants to help </v>

1741
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.491
<v Speaker 1>the country be unified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who genuinely wants to help the </v>

1742
01:16:08.491 --> 01:16:08.980
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not help their party,</v>

1743
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not help themselves,</v>

1744
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:11.890
<v Speaker 1>not just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1745
01:16:11.891 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this is all done,</v>

1746
01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:17.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a fucking million </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a year doing speaking fees or </v>

1747
01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:22.171
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however much they make when they do </v>

1748
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:22.171
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1749
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:22.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1750
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:22.880
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

1751
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need that to stay to remain a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1752
01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1753
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1754
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it really is headed towards a bad place </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1755
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that person is going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome the sort of reflexive reaction </v>

1756
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:41.650
<v Speaker 1>of the left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1757
01:16:41.651 --> 01:16:46.651
<v Speaker 1>he's not my president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reflexive reaction of the right </v>

1758
01:16:46.651 --> 01:16:50.281
<v Speaker 1>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wing hated Obama in ways that </v>

1759
01:16:50.281 --> 01:16:51.010
<v Speaker 1>were completely out of proportion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's actual policies.</v>

1760
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Mitch Mcconnell said,</v>

1761
01:16:53.531 --> 01:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans job in Congress,</v>

1762
01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.720
<v Speaker 1>their foremost job is to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama is a complete failure as a </v>

1763
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.030
<v Speaker 1>president like it that's not serving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

1764
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:04.960
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1765
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:09.961
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need a leader who is actually </v>

1766
01:17:09.961 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>able to overcome that toxic thinking</v>

1767
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 3>in both parties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1768
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1769
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:18.110
<v Speaker 3>who is Jesus coming back like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know who's going to do this,</v>

1770
01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>who is going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the start is a bipartisan </v>

1771
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>commission that starts to call people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1772
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

1773
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you have Republicans calling Republicans</v>
<v Speaker 3>out because they're on this commission.</v>

1774
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Do you have Democrats Calling Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

1775
01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:34.541
<v Speaker 3>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the free speech to make a fool </v>

1776
01:17:34.541 --> 01:17:34.541
<v Speaker 3>of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

1777
01:17:34.541 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 3>But you're not going to undermine this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country without being called out by this</v>

1778
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 3>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1779
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:44.690
<v Speaker 3>and I was talking with someone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>government pretty high up about this and</v>

1780
01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I had sent my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll bullets aren't going to destroy </v>

1782
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:50.660
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1783
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:50.850
<v Speaker 3>is never going to destroy this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1784
01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 3>but our own words we'll can destroy our </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy like that actually could do it</v>

1785
01:17:55.941 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 3>if we play this hand drawn.</v>

1786
01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes partisan rhetoric actually a </v>

1787
01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 3>matter of national security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you can think about as an think</v>

1788
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:09.731
<v Speaker 3>about it as a national security concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you actually have a sort of </v>

1789
01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 3>political and legal basis for forming a </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission that addresses it.</v>

1790
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 3>And I really truly think that should </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1791
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully something else will happen.</v>

1792
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:23.771
<v Speaker 3>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the only thing I can think of </v>

1793
01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:23.771
<v Speaker 3>that will begin to address that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can,</v>

1794
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 3>that can rise up above the partisan </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest of both parties because those,</v>

1795
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.460
<v Speaker 3>the parties clearly don't seem capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing it on their own.</v>

1796
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Now when you write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like try,</v>

1797
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:38.561
<v Speaker 3>when you outline all these issues that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have and all these issues </v>

1798
01:18:38.561 --> 01:18:41.651
<v Speaker 3>historically that people have had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you try to consider a solution?</v>

1799
01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:42.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

1800
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:44.030
<v Speaker 3>do you have a solution?</v>

1801
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you just examining all the various </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that we have?</v>

1802
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.120
<v Speaker 3>So I mean tribe was me trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of sort of what ails us,</v>

1803
01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 3>starting with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1804
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:02.470
<v Speaker 3>people hemorrhaging off the frontier to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Indians and on up to the </v>

1805
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:04.040
<v Speaker 3>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with mass shootings,</v>

1806
01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's,</v>

1807
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:06.770
<v Speaker 3>something's not working for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1808
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:09.580
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was foremost in analysis.</v>

1809
01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and towards the end,</v>

1810
01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked a little bit about solutions </v>

1811
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 3>and one of the solutions I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>was making a concerted effort to get rid</v>

1812
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 3>of contemptuous partisan rhetoric in </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1813
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:25.670
<v Speaker 3>And I really felt that that trickles </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and pollutes,</v>

1814
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 3>it pollutes the water stream down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like downstream.</v>

1815
01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:34.211
<v Speaker 3>It pollutes everything so that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>all as citizens are drinking toxic </v>

1816
01:19:34.211 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1817
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:40.600
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that rhetoric and wondering if the </v>

1818
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.570
<v Speaker 3>unity can survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like will this will the center hold?</v>

1819
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1820
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:48.191
<v Speaker 3>you hear your parents screaming at each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other in the bedroom and saying </v>

1821
01:19:48.191 --> 01:19:48.620
<v Speaker 3>unforgivable things to each other as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>

1822
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:49.880
<v Speaker 3>you might rightly think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1823
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 3>this marriage isn't lasting in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>family is not lasting.</v>

1824
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.460
<v Speaker 3>That's how it feels to be a citizen of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States right now.</v>

1825
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Like mom and dad are screaming at each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1826
01:19:57.201 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Speaker 3>And so I talked about contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

1827
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:06.071
<v Speaker 3>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't speak with contempt about someone </v>

1828
01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:09.011
<v Speaker 3>you share a combat outpost width and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what this country potentially as </v>

1829
01:20:09.011 --> 01:20:09.011
<v Speaker 3>don't you think also</v>

1830
01:20:09.011 --> 01:20:13.490
<v Speaker 1>with the mom and dad analogy that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>also shows you how to behave in your own</v>

1831
01:20:14.341 --> 01:20:19.341
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the things </v>

1832
01:20:19.341 --> 01:20:20.871
<v Speaker 1>that's really important about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president is the president does sort of </v>

1833
01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:21.570
<v Speaker 1>represent the best example of what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

1834
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.310
<v Speaker 1>When we were kids growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing,</v>

1835
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>like he asked the kid what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1836
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:26.710
<v Speaker 1>If someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be president,</v>

1837
01:20:26.711 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 1>and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1838
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you're really going for a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the biggest job.</v>

1839
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're supposed to be the best person</v>

1840
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:39.831
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we hold someone to such an </v>

1841
01:20:39.831 --> 01:20:41.631
<v Speaker 1>incredible microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost even more impressive </v>

1842
01:20:41.631 --> 01:20:44.541
<v Speaker 1>that trump won after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the pussy audio recording and that </v>

1843
01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.050
<v Speaker 1>he could just brush that off as locker </v>
<v Speaker 1>room talk.</v>

1844
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It's right in a way.</v>

1845
01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:48.630
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1846
01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:53.631
<v Speaker 1>it really is kind of fucked up that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did try to use that on them and pull it </v>

1847
01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:57.531
<v Speaker 1>out the last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does give you also an </v>

1848
01:20:57.531 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how he thinks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaves when no one's around.</v>

1849
01:20:58.530 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1850
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my problem with him was that I like if I</v>

1851
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:07.880
<v Speaker 1>look at the worst of his behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1852
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean people sent society says people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to jail for the worst thing that they </v>

1853
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:16.521
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is actually legitimate to judge </v>

1854
01:21:16.521 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 1>people's worst behavior and evaluate </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on that basis.</v>

1855
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So if I look at the wharf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the worst of his behavior,</v>

1856
01:21:20.281 --> 01:21:25.281
<v Speaker 1>even if I was a diehard Republican who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who adhere to all of the things he says </v>

1857
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:29.271
<v Speaker 1>he believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I looked at the worst of his </v>

1858
01:21:29.271 --> 01:21:29.271
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mocking a gold star family,</v>

1859
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:33.570
<v Speaker 1>like mocking a disabled person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't real though,</v>

1860
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 1>you know that mocking a disabled person </v>
<v Speaker 1>was sort of trumped up.</v>

1861
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.600
<v Speaker 1>He does hate to use that word trump cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that when he's talking about </v>

1862
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you asked flustered like,</v>

1863
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do here?</v>

1864
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Like that they tried to say that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking a reporter that it was disabled,</v>

1865
01:21:51.211 --> 01:21:53.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty clear that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1866
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe so,</v>

1867
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:59.601
<v Speaker 1>but with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a question from someone who's </v>

1868
01:21:59.601 --> 01:21:59.601
<v Speaker 1>visibly disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you just don't do that.</v>

1869
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like each pattern it does.</v>

1870
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'm giving him more of the </v>

1871
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:09.381
<v Speaker 1>benefit of the doubt that I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it was the only example that I </v>

1872
01:22:09.381 --> 01:22:09.710
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a sort of pattern that,</v>

1873
01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:14.711
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that model from Mexico who gained some </v>

1874
01:22:14.711 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 1>weight that he was walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the mockery of less powerful</v>

1875
01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:18.510
<v Speaker 1>people is sort of endless.</v>

1876
01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1877
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have that person at my dinner</v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

1878
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just with my close friends,</v>

1879
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:30.090
<v Speaker 1>like someone who was acting like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started acting,</v>

1880
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:34.710
<v Speaker 1>started doing that and my dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd walk around,</v>

1881
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I get up and walk around the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a headlock,</v>

1882
01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I think drag him out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1883
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to think that about my </v>

1884
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my president to be someone I'd be</v>

1885
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.490
<v Speaker 1>like glad to have at my dinner table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1886
01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 1>would've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't vote for George Bush by love to</v>

1887
01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>have that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had dinner table,</v>

1888
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know what I mean?</v>

1889
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Like he's the first president and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1890
01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:58.490
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to subject my bi friends </v>

1891
01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:01.550
<v Speaker 1>too that you ever read rudy errol woody </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrelson's account of a dinner that he </v>

1892
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:05.691
<v Speaker 1>had with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said literally had to get up in the </v>

1893
01:23:05.691 --> 01:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>middle and go outside and smoke a joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to just</v>

1894
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 2>relax himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you said early 2000.</v>

1896
01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:14.820
<v Speaker 2>He had a dinner with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said he never met someone so </v>

1897
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so self obsessed.</v>

1898
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1899
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:16.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1900
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:21.770
<v Speaker 3>my worry like in this conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it will somehow seem partisan and </v>

1901
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:24.720
<v Speaker 3>like I will be saying the same things if</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump were a democrat,</v>

1902
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.650
<v Speaker 2>something about George Bush that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be happy to have him over.</v>

1903
01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>And I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that what comes out of this is </v>

1904
01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:33.920
<v Speaker 2>that a hero will rise and that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

1905
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's really legitimately good </v>
<v Speaker 2>person will say,</v>

1906
01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

1907
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
<v Speaker 2>this is a fucking travis day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who actually could assume </v>

1908
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.351
<v Speaker 2>the role correctly will step into place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was see that very clearly in </v>

1909
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1910
01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Well what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get back to your question?</v>

1911
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 3>One of the solutions that I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1912
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:54.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this.</v>

1913
01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:58.100
<v Speaker 3>This is national compulsory national </v>
<v Speaker 3>service with a,</v>

1914
01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:03.140
<v Speaker 3>with a military option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the your question was how do we </v>

1915
01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 3>make this nation feel like a nation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1916
01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:09.060
<v Speaker 3>And the problem psychologist will tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that the more you sacrifice for </v>

1917
01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you value it.</v>

1918
01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.780
<v Speaker 3>And if you're part of something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't require any sacrifice at all,</v>

1919
01:24:13.781 --> 01:24:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you just don't value it very highly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1920
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:20.470
<v Speaker 3>The advantage of national service it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean the draft,</v>

1921
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I think I don't mean military service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean national service with a military </v>

1922
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:30.091
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's moral to force </v>

1923
01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:30.091
<v Speaker 3>someone to fight a war that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it.</v>

1924
01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 3>But what sort of service which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1925
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1926
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:33.540
<v Speaker 3>the nation needs a lot of stuff done </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1927
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:37.690
<v Speaker 3>And whatever that may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point of it is,</v>

1928
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 3>so if you had a military option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but otherwise you could teach in schools</v>

1929
01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:46.051
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you could dig ditches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't whatever the nation needs done </v>

1930
01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 3>this work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this core of workers at 22,</v>

1931
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:51.480
<v Speaker 3>23 years old does it for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first wife was from,</v>

1932
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 3>from the eastern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from eastern Europe and the young people</v>

1933
01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.540
<v Speaker 3>formed work brigades in the summer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>help harvest like harvest wheat and </v>

1934
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.730
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that was what she did when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a teenage girl.</v>

1935
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.820
<v Speaker 3>And it was incredibly good for the kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and it made them feel like </v>

1936
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Speaker 3>they're part of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1937
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 3>And so what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a downside to national service,</v>

1938
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:16.060
<v Speaker 3>which is the government's telling people</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do.</v>

1939
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Of course there's also an upside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is it makes everyone feel like </v>

1940
01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:24.661
<v Speaker 3>they're part of this thing called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and it puts white people </v>

1941
01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:25.080
<v Speaker 3>and black people enrich and poured.</v>

1942
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts them all in one big pot and stirs </v>

1943
01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:30.090
<v Speaker 3>them up just like the military does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they get to know each other.</v>

1944
01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And so everything's is an upside and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>downside to everything.</v>

1945
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So national service has a very obvious </v>

1946
01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:39.420
<v Speaker 3>downside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the upside isn't discussed much,</v>

1947
01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>which is that it creates an American </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>

1948
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.840
<v Speaker 3>a shared experience that all Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that like in Israel is compulsory </v>

1949
01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 3>service and that that is a common ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>that every single Israeli has,</v>

1950
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.680
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever they fall in the political </v>

1951
01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:58.680
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have that shared experience and</v>

1952
01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.020
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormously potent thing in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1953
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Keeping it bound together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this country I</v>

1954
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.930
<v Speaker 1>think needs something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be very,</v>

1955
01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1956
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if people did have some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

1957
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 1>if you use some sort of connection to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to keep things running,</v>

1958
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:19.130
<v Speaker 1>whether it's help fix the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

1959
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help do something.</v>

1960
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:25.631
<v Speaker 1>But the problem that I would have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably I would have with it is the </v>

1961
01:26:25.631 --> 01:26:30.281
<v Speaker 1>idea that someone from the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be able to require you to do </v>

1962
01:26:30.281 --> 01:26:33.581
<v Speaker 1>something and that if you didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could treat you the same way the </v>

1963
01:26:33.581 --> 01:26:33.581
<v Speaker 1>irs treats you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't pay your taxes,</v>

1964
01:26:33.581 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I just lock you in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

1965
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one made,</v>

1966
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.150
<v Speaker 1>one way to do it might be to incentivize</v>
<v Speaker 1>it by sort of making it mandatory,</v>

1967
01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 1>incentivizing it by giving people really</v>
<v Speaker 1>large tax breaks for doing it.</v>

1968
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but young people aren't going to think </v>

1969
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.470
<v Speaker 1>about tax breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to think about,</v>

1970
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.081
<v Speaker 1>fuck that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to skateboard or I don't want to </v>

1971
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:53.081
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1972
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:53.081
<v Speaker 1>Then they have to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1973
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:57.791
<v Speaker 1>for most of this nation's history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had a draft as the government </v>

1974
01:26:57.791 --> 01:26:57.791
<v Speaker 1>telling people what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1975
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:00.230
<v Speaker 1>And likewise with taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay your taxes,</v>

1976
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 1>you go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean the government does,</v>

1977
01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:07.340
<v Speaker 1>the government puts red lights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intersections and you have to fucking </v>

1978
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:07.340
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1979
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 1>But to try to do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be extremely difficult.</v>

1980
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.040
<v Speaker 1>The distrust of the government is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>high and if the government comes along </v>

1981
01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do all these things and then</v>

1982
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1983
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:19.190
<v Speaker 1>are you doing these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to join the military?</v>

1984
01:27:19.191 --> 01:27:21.230
<v Speaker 1>You're 55 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your senator,</v>

1985
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:24.860
<v Speaker 1>are you going to go pick wheat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fix the roads?</v>

1986
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It definitely has to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1987
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

1988
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get 60 year olds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in national service,</v>

1989
01:27:29.871 --> 01:27:31.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already involved their lives.</v>

1990
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 1>The great thing about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

1991
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 1>20 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 year olds,</v>

1992
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>is that their lives haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>started yet.</v>

1993
01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why it works in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So are people gonna object you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are,</v>

1995
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:47.111
<v Speaker 1>but the question is how do we unify this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that the truth is like if we </v>

1996
01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted to unify communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd been in the car,</v>

1997
01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:49.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can,</v>

1998
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you know they are living there spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole lives within walking </v>

1999
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 1>distance of their home that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will unify communities.</v>

2000
01:27:56.130 --> 01:28:01.130
<v Speaker 1>We're just not willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will unify the country's national </v>

2001
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:01.670
<v Speaker 1>service?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may not be willing to do it,</v>

2002
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different conversation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it work or not?</v>

2003
01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.830
<v Speaker 1>My opinion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it would help.</v>

2004
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a good opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2005
01:28:08.841 --> 01:28:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely see merit in it.</v>

2006
01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would be a fascinating </v>

2007
01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:18.341
<v Speaker 1>debate to have back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder if people at any point in </v>

2008
01:28:18.341 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 1>their lives today who would be willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give up freedom for the government.</v>

2009
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I think people are used to this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like free ride.</v>

2010
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I pay my taxes and that's all you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

2011
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do anything.</v>

2012
01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Australia you have to vote and if you</v>

2013
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:31.390
<v Speaker 1>don't vote you get fined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

2014
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you said it right there.</v>

2015
01:28:33.531 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not for the government,</v>

2016
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>it's for your neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for your fellow citizens.</v>

2017
01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything you pay your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for the government.</v>

2018
01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:46.900
<v Speaker 1>You pay your taxes for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you pay him to the Gulf,</v>

2019
01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:47.780
<v Speaker 1>to the government.</v>

2020
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:52.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no auditing of your taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the things </v>

2021
01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:55.601
<v Speaker 1>that freaks people out today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know where that money is </v>

2022
01:28:55.601 --> 01:28:58.151
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to tell you and if you </v>

2023
01:28:58.151 --> 01:28:58.151
<v Speaker 1>don't give it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll lock you up.</v>

2024
01:28:58.151 --> 01:29:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with a large </v>

2025
01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.701
<v Speaker 1>scale society is that collective effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear that that collective </v>

2026
01:29:03.701 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 1>effort is going to the whole entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's going to the tax man.</v>

2027
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2028
01:29:08.371 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2029
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.080
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the check is to the irs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the irs handed over to the government </v>

2030
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 1>that that's then spends it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

2031
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality,</v>

2032
01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like the irs is oppressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2033
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's actually not what's </v>

2034
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:25.760
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2035
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.070
<v Speaker 1>The irs is an arm of government that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>elected in.</v>

2036
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been charged with getting,</v>

2037
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>getting money from people like that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the irs isn't doing anything.</v>

2038
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Tsa ever.</v>

2039
01:29:33.921 --> 01:29:38.921
<v Speaker 1>I was standing in line at Tsa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was complaining about how long </v>

2040
01:29:38.921 --> 01:29:38.921
<v Speaker 1>it was taking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2041
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and the guy next to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even know each other and the</v>

2042
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 1>guy next to her who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2043
01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing it for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it for us.</v>

2044
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're searching all our stuff.</v>

2045
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2046
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 1>They're not on the damn plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're searching our stuff for us.</v>

2047
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Likewise with the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government isn't doing it for itself</v>

2048
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.240
<v Speaker 1>is still new for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2049
01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:02.550
<v Speaker 1>We like to think of it as one entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2050
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 1>We like to think of the irs as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2051
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are collecting the money.</v>

2052
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 1>We almost think of it as them spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money as well.</v>

2053
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 1>We don't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was distributing it to the rest of </v>

2054
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

2055
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2056
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:16.020
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to gin up as sort of like</v>

2057
01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.080
<v Speaker 1>antigovernment screed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's easy to play on that </v>

2058
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:21.080
<v Speaker 1>misperception because it's an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>misperception to,</v>

2059
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:26.330
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get a $200 parking ticket in </v>

2060
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 1>New York and he definitely feels like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parking bureau is like,</v>

2061
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:29.340
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is vengeful,</v>

2062
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

2063
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:35.391
<v Speaker 1>has targeted you personally as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take your $200 and spend it on </v>

2064
01:30:35.391 --> 01:30:35.850
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feels like.</v>

2065
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:41.390
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that that $200 paves the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fills in the potholes that you're going </v>

2066
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>to be driving across next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth of it,</v>

2067
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:48.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what we're talking about </v>

2068
01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:48.080
<v Speaker 1>solutions for the woes of society in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

2069
01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have sort of found your own solution</v>

2070
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:57.590
<v Speaker 1>in journalism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and embedded journalism in these very </v>

2071
01:30:57.590 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>dangerous environments that this is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have sort of reinforced your tribe.</v>

2072
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.160
<v Speaker 1>And you talk about that in the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how,</v>

2073
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2074
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:08.420
<v Speaker 1>how well you slept in this very tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>confines in these bases with all these,</v>

2075
01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:13.671
<v Speaker 1>like very loud snoring men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that you guys were all </v>

2076
01:31:13.671 --> 01:31:16.140
<v Speaker 1>together in this very hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

2077
01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but that was your solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2078
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a solution in this </v>

2079
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.110
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2080
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:25.360
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a longterm solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did give me these experience of </v>

2081
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2082
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>sort of shared a shared fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2083
01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of collective effort,</v>

2084
01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:32.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was part of this group,</v>

2085
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my,</v>

2086
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.680
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my welfare was tied to the welfare of </v>

2087
01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.621
<v Speaker 1>the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My actions could help or hinder the </v>

2088
01:31:42.621 --> 01:31:45.141
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was judged by how I behaved in the </v>

2089
01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:45.141
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2090
01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our evolutionary past.</v>

2091
01:31:46.681 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And it felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2092
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2093
01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2094
01:31:51.901 --> 01:31:53.190
<v Speaker 1>the trick is we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2095
01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:58.191
<v Speaker 1>we live in a dispersed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern society where that's just not </v>

2096
01:31:58.191 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 1>going to be the 20 hour a day reality</v>

2097
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.210
<v Speaker 3>for most people throughout their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it may not need to be,</v>

2098
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.460
<v Speaker 3>you may just need a little bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
01:32:06.461 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe you get a little bit of that sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of collective,</v>

2100
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 3>the collective norm at the boxing gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe you get it in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2102
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe you get it hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2103
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there are ways to experience it and</v>

2104
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maybe you get it a church in a.</v>

2105
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not religious,</v>

2106
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2107
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I understand church to be a profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 3>communal activity and so I'm not saying </v>

2108
01:32:31.181 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>burn down that suburbs and bend the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although that would work pretty well.</v>

2109
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe for your own personal sense of </v>

2110
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:41.560
<v Speaker 3>meaning and fulfillment in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find,</v>

2111
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:46.590
<v Speaker 3>find that collective experience in </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bits and pieces and the little </v>

2112
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:47.790
<v Speaker 3>goes a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.170
<v Speaker 3>And doing something and doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

2114
01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2115
01:32:52.511 --> 01:32:57.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean getting together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot pool with your buddies every </v>

2116
01:32:57.511 --> 01:32:57.511
<v Speaker 3>Thursday night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

2117
01:32:57.511 --> 01:32:59.620
<v Speaker 3>But it's not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about difficult things and</v>

2118
01:32:59.621 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 3>things that test you physically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally for some reason there.</v>

2119
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Those seem to be a requirement for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and when people don't,</v>

2120
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.880
<v Speaker 3>don't fulfill that requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me those are the people that</v>

2121
01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 3>are most unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2122
01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean the state there have to be stakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

2123
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no stakes to pool to golf </v>

2124
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pleasure gambling.</v>

2125
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2126
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:21.790
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a collective,</v>

2127
01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.450
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a collective state and um,</v>

2128
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 3>they're pleasant activities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

2129
01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:28.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2130
01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 3>what reproduces our evolutionary past as</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a small group where the stakes </v>

2131
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.910
<v Speaker 3>are for the stakes are serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not life and death,</v>

2132
01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:38.830
<v Speaker 3>but even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's not life and death,</v>

2133
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:40.930
<v Speaker 3>at least they're real physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

2134
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:44.290
<v Speaker 3>And that collective action makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

2135
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:48.880
<v Speaker 3>makes the group more able to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 3>those adversities successfully.</v>

2136
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.440
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2137
01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an intoxicating feeling is what </v>

2138
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.971
<v Speaker 3>we're wired for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what we're missing in our sort of </v>

2139
01:33:59.971 --> 01:34:00.450
<v Speaker 3>modern lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

2140
01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a huge amount of it to </v>

2141
01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.790
<v Speaker 3>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that seems to make people </v>

2142
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:09.790
<v Speaker 3>feel very fulfilled as creating things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with their hands,</v>

2143
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:12.690
<v Speaker 3>creating anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's furniture,</v>

2144
01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.830
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just making something,</v>

2145
01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 3>doing something where your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in natural task of bringing </v>

2146
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 3>forth something into existence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't exist before.</v>

2147
01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:23.030
<v Speaker 3>What we'll think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2148
01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.850
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of evolution,</v>

2149
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:29.910
<v Speaker 3>if doing something successfully produces</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chemical reaction that feels good,</v>

2150
01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of dopamine or in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communal connection,</v>

2151
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of Oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2152
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trained monkey that we are,</v>

2153
01:34:39.670 --> 01:34:40.750
<v Speaker 3>we'll continue doing that.</v>

2154
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2155
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.920
<v Speaker 3>so basically the tasks that helped with </v>
<v Speaker 3>survival get rewarded with </v>

2156
01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.560
<v Speaker 3>neurochemicals that feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:52.760
<v Speaker 3>And the things that are dangerous to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2158
01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and less than our chance for survival </v>

2159
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 3>don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So being isolated,</v>

2160
01:34:58.671 --> 01:35:03.671
<v Speaker 3>being alienated from your group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an outcast feels bad and your </v>

2161
01:35:03.671 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 3>survival chances go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2162
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to stay in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to join the group again.</v>

2163
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:14.651
<v Speaker 3>And so there's these neurochemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>reward incentives and punishments that </v>

2164
01:35:14.651 --> 01:35:18.791
<v Speaker 3>get heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People towards behaviors that help </v>

2165
01:35:18.791 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 3>survival build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things,</v>

2166
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>building things that all feels good.</v>

2167
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.880
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly what we needed to do in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary past and is reinforced and </v>

2168
01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:33.050
<v Speaker 3>creativity factors onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How that like say like art,</v>

2169
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:36.260
<v Speaker 3>like painting or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something deeply satisfying</v>

2170
01:35:36.261 --> 01:35:37.760
<v Speaker 3>to people that are painters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2171
01:35:37.761 --> 01:35:38.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2172
01:35:38.211 --> 01:35:39.920
<v Speaker 3>and what they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean art,</v>

2173
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know from the,</v>

2174
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.840
<v Speaker 3>from the incredible paintings on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>caves and in the caves in France and </v>

2175
01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.371
<v Speaker 3>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lesko and the other caves that art is </v>

2176
01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:54.380
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's used to bind </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities together in ceremonies.</v>

2177
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see you in church.</v>

2178
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>

2179
01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:59.480
<v Speaker 3>there is no church in the land that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have art on the walls,</v>

2180
01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2181
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 3>the depictions of Christ or whatever or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the visual aids that helps bind</v>

2182
01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:06.740
<v Speaker 3>people into a group like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2183
01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 3>we all believe in the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2184
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 3>So art is a great binding force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Music is an incredible binding force.</v>

2185
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.380
<v Speaker 3>So rhythmic like rhythm and heavy </v>
<v Speaker 3>drumming rhythm.</v>

2186
01:36:15.381 --> 01:36:18.470
<v Speaker 3>We'll get a whole group of people sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of moving in unison.</v>

2187
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan Haidt has talked about,</v>

2188
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:25.670
<v Speaker 3>he talked about that sort of hive </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and how it works and very,</v>

2189
01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 3>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I would say,</v>

2190
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:33.731
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just guessing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say is that the arch that </v>

2191
01:36:33.731 --> 01:36:36.341
<v Speaker 3>are so intoxicating to be engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their survival value is that it makes </v>

2192
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 3>the group cohere around a unified idea.</v>

2193
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 3>And that music does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the visual arts do that.</v>

2194
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spoken word poetry song,</v>

2195
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:48.350
<v Speaker 3>all those do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

2196
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:51.740
<v Speaker 3>you have a group of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are unified on these all,</v>

2197
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 3>all these different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when the enemy comes,</v>

2198
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean the music starts the sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual pageantry starts like you get,</v>

2199
01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

2200
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war time posters showing heroic </v>

2201
01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:06.520
<v Speaker 3>soldiers with rifle and bayonet or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the,</v>

2202
01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:06.830
<v Speaker 3>the war art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2203
01:37:06.831 --> 01:37:10.640
<v Speaker 3>You get the martial music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that galvanizes the public spirit</v>

2204
01:37:10.641 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 3>to face the enemy and it works extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2205
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think that that's one of the </v>

2206
01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:18.400
<v Speaker 3>reasons why art is so satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2207
01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.291
<v Speaker 3>I just assume that our evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced that anything that feels good </v>

2208
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:28.490
<v Speaker 3>to us had survival value in our past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so of creating art feels good.</v>

2209
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.420
<v Speaker 3>That's because we are genetically </v>
<v Speaker 3>predisposed towards doing things that </v>

2210
01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.230
<v Speaker 3>bind the group together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Generosity feels good,</v>

2211
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you walk down the street and you give</v>

2212
01:37:37.911 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 3>someone $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just a random dude,</v>

2213
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:42.500
<v Speaker 3>you just give them five bucks and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure the.</v>

2214
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:45.080
<v Speaker 3>The neurochemicals in his brain and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

2215
01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.230
<v Speaker 3>you get more of a high than he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2216
01:37:48.231 --> 01:37:53.231
<v Speaker 3>So generosity feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly adaptive and helps groups </v>

2217
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:53.231
<v Speaker 3>go here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2218
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Art as well,</v>

2219
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 1>so that art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you create something amazing,</v>

2220
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:00.660
<v Speaker 1>what you're realizing is that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see that and go,</v>

2221
01:38:00.661 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

2222
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to get a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling off of seeing your art.</v>

2223
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the same vision,</v>

2224
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I painted that tree and this other </v>

2225
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.181
<v Speaker 1>person or that antelope or that bison or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you find in the walls of the </v>

2226
01:38:14.181 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and this other person comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2227
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:17.440
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible bison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2228
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:22.790
<v Speaker 1>like you did something the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to now you the two of you are </v>

2229
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 1>joined in your understanding of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that painting means.</v>

2230
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very powerful thing.</v>

2231
01:38:27.721 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So if you drew that bison and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>else in the world ever saw it,</v>

2232
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing that the chemical rewards </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that creativity would be let will be</v>

2233
01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:39.240
<v Speaker 1>lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2235
01:38:39.841 --> 01:38:44.841
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that in my children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids love to draw and one of the </v>

2236
01:38:44.841 --> 01:38:44.841
<v Speaker 1>things that they love is showing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawings.</v>

2237
01:38:44.841 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean they love to draw but like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

2238
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

2239
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 1>And then when they're done like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and I'm just like boom.</v>

2240
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:55.941
<v Speaker 1>They did getting that little rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and you get the rush and I </v>

2241
01:38:55.941 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just do it.</v>

2242
01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:02.180
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to test like taking musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure their neurochemicals while </v>

2243
01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 1>they're practicing in a room by </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and then put them in a,</v>

2244
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stadium filled with 10,000</v>

2245
01:39:06.211 --> 01:39:08.030
<v Speaker 1>people and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2246
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing that the guy in the stadium</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Bruce Springsteen in front of </v>

2247
01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.701
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people is experiencing a neurochemical </v>

2248
01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:17.400
<v Speaker 1>reality that he's not getting in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>living room.</v>

2249
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Not only that'll probably a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurochemical reality that very few </v>

2250
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.910
<v Speaker 1>human beings will ever experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2251
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about the power of that.</v>

2252
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2253
01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:32.661
<v Speaker 1>any musician on stage is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting sort of in the role of the </v>

2254
01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:32.661
<v Speaker 1>Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2255
01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:33.870
<v Speaker 1>To like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act.</v>

2256
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as a conduit between </v>
<v Speaker 1>you all and the divine right and my </v>

2257
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:41.160
<v Speaker 1>music is going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My words,</v>

2258
01:39:41.161 --> 01:39:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do it by dances going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2259
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:44.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'm the conduit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2260
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm connecting you with a,</v>

2261
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:51.370
<v Speaker 1>with a divine feeling and that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to unify all of you and I'm </v>

2262
01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:55.131
<v Speaker 1>going to play these chords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sing this song and like </v>

2263
01:39:55.131 --> 01:39:56.010
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are going to be tapping your feet in</v>

2264
01:39:56.011 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 1>unison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you get 10,000</v>

2265
01:39:58.111 --> 01:40:00.150
<v Speaker 1>people do the same thing at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2266
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.550
<v Speaker 1>You sing them a song is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2267
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:05.940
<v Speaker 1>That's an incredibly powerful thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the uh,</v>

2268
01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the power of the Shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bruce springsteen isn't a shaman </v>

2269
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he occupies that space in a modern,</v>

2270
01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:17.061
<v Speaker 1>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular society doesn't have shebeens </v>

2271
01:40:17.061 --> 01:40:17.061
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the old days,</v>

2272
01:40:17.061 --> 01:40:17.330
<v Speaker 1>that's what he would be.</v>

2273
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that way when you put a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

2274
01:40:20.130 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Like when you put the book out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know it's done,</v>

2275
01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:26.961
<v Speaker 1>you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done and he sent it out there and </v>

2276
01:40:26.961 --> 01:40:26.961
<v Speaker 1>do what kind of weird feeling that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

2277
01:40:26.961 --> 01:40:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Are People going to read that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing about a book </v>

2278
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:33.231
<v Speaker 1>because you actually never observe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>real time people's reaction to it.</v>

2279
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not perched in someone's arm chair </v>

2280
01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:39.260
<v Speaker 1>watching them read in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2281
01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Like the general public about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>reviews.</v>

2282
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also very.</v>

2283
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very distant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I started making documentaries </v>

2284
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the experience or the experiencing</v>

2285
01:40:51.841 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>of watching other people's experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'd done</v>

2286
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not watching the audience,</v>

2287
01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the audience and I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>people react to ristreppo.</v>

2288
01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got to see people react to the </v>

2289
01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:04.320
<v Speaker 3>books I read because I'm not in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn bedroom.</v>

2290
01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2291
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.440
<v Speaker 3>But I am in the movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching people react to the things </v>

2292
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.760
<v Speaker 3>that the films I made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't say it's apples.</v>

2293
01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Oranges under know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one better was what,</v>

2294
01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:15.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2295
01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:18.550
<v Speaker 3>But it's a very different experience in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly powerful.</v>

2296
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Which do you like one better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2297
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:27.481
<v Speaker 3>movies just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have enough bits of </v>

2298
01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:28.030
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a book.</v>

2299
01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You can really communicate information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2300
01:41:30.671 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Very sophisticated ideas and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent,</v>

2301
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:38.881
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are in the person's bookshelf and </v>

2302
01:41:38.881 --> 01:41:38.881
<v Speaker 3>the person could underline that </v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph and go back to it.</v>

2303
01:41:38.881 --> 01:41:43.201
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've actually affected sort of </v>

2304
01:41:43.201 --> 01:41:45.451
<v Speaker 3>communal thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've affected the way people </v>

2305
01:41:45.451 --> 01:41:48.001
<v Speaker 3>understand the world of film is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience more than it is a sort of </v>

2306
01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.790
<v Speaker 3>data dump and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a philosophical argument.</v>

2307
01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 3>And that experience is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful.</v>

2308
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:56.920
<v Speaker 3>It acts on a different part of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a book does.</v>

2309
01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>It's much more emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2310
01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2311
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:02.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2312
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:07.290
<v Speaker 3>I've choked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've teared up watching my own films </v>

2313
01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 3>because they're personal to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2314
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I've never done that reading my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

2315
01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:15.210
<v Speaker 3>rereading a book that I've written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a different experience and I </v>

2316
01:42:15.210 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 3>would never say this is different parts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the human mind like you need,</v>

2317
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.940
<v Speaker 3>you certainly need boats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So no long answer.</v>

2318
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I,</v>

2319
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I need both now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This documentary on Syria,</v>

2320
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:25.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when is this available?</v>

2321
01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2322
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 3>we may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called Hell on earth.</v>

2323
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our website is hell on earth.com.</v>

2324
01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2325
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:37.500
<v Speaker 3>how'd you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that would have already </v>

2326
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:37.500
<v Speaker 3>been taken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2327
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.070
<v Speaker 3>The different websites that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

2328
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:39.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2329
01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2330
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't in charge of getting it by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wizard.</v>

2331
01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to pay for that one.</v>

2332
01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 3>So it was called Hell on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the Syrian civil war.</v>

2333
01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made it for National Geographic.</v>

2334
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:55.201
<v Speaker 3>I made it with Nick quested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my partner and all the films that I've </v>

2335
01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:55.201
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2336
01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:58.480
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brought it broadcast last June.</v>

2337
01:42:58.660 --> 01:42:59.460
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2338
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 3>nat Geo rebroadcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that they do,</v>

2339
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 3>obviously you can also go to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>website and stream it.</v>

2340
01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.130
<v Speaker 3>It's about this treatment today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2341
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.050
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the Syrian civil war,</v>

2342
01:43:08.051 --> 01:43:09.690
<v Speaker 3>how it started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2343
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.970
<v Speaker 3>and particularly how isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why isis arose up out of that.</v>

2344
01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:18.140
<v Speaker 3>And we all know what Isis is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is grotesquely violent radical </v>

2345
01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:18.900
<v Speaker 3>jihadist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2346
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

2347
01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have all seen,</v>

2348
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:26.870
<v Speaker 3>seen their video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of their videos where they're </v>

2349
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:29.220
<v Speaker 3>beheading people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of a video camera and a </v>

2350
01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:29.220
<v Speaker 3>ghastly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ghastly things.</v>

2351
01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:29.470
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did that,</v>

2352
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 3>why did that happen in Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did that,</v>

2353
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:36.870
<v Speaker 3>that mutation occur at this point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history in that place.</v>

2354
01:43:36.881 --> 01:43:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2355
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:40.660
<v Speaker 3>the film examines that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2356
01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.790
<v Speaker 3>were you there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you go to Syria?</v>

2357
01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:43.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2358
01:43:43.361 --> 01:43:45.700
<v Speaker 3>after my friend Tim Hetherington was </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed,</v>

2359
01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim,</v>

2360
01:43:46.650 --> 01:43:50.500
<v Speaker 3>obviously I made restrepo with an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a brother and a good friend and a</v>

2361
01:43:50.501 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 3>colleague and he was killed in Libya in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2011,</v>

2362
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on an assignment that I was supposed to </v>

2363
01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:58.960
<v Speaker 3>be on with him at the last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go and he got killed.</v>

2364
01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.580
<v Speaker 3>And so I stopped war reporting after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that front line reporting.</v>

2365
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Syria was so dangerous that you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of going in there.</v>

2366
01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in numerous kidnappings and beheadings,</v>

2367
01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was basically a suicide by the time </v>

2368
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 3>we started working on the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a suicide mission.</v>

2369
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.980
<v Speaker 3>So we actually worked with Syrians in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria who are documenting their own war.</v>

2370
01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a including an incredible family </v>

2371
01:44:23.650 --> 01:44:27.011
<v Speaker 3>that was living under a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in territory under isis control and </v>

2372
01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 3>surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to figure out like,</v>

2373
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 3>do we try to escape or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course if you try to escape and </v>

2374
01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 3>you're caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>

2375
01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 3>They will drag your family out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pickup truck in line.</v>

2376
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:37.190
<v Speaker 3>You open a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a machine gun you.</v>

2377
01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.350
<v Speaker 3>But they were worried that if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed,</v>

2378
01:44:39.351 --> 01:44:41.960
<v Speaker 3>they also die and they decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>escape.</v>

2379
01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 3>We got a camera to them at a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>nondescript little cell phone camera and</v>

2380
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:51.101
<v Speaker 3>they self documented life under isis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the decision to leave and the um,</v>

2381
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:56.830
<v Speaker 3>their flight through the isis </v>
<v Speaker 3>checkpoints through the front lines all </v>

2382
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:57.560
<v Speaker 3>the way to Turkey and they self </v>
<v Speaker 3>documented and it's part of,</v>

2383
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 3>it's the sort of through line in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

2384
01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely extraordinary family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2385
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:04.570
<v Speaker 3>And so then they're in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're in Turkey.</v>

2386
01:45:04.610 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Then they tried to get to Greece on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubber raft on a Zodiac.</v>

2387
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 3>They returned again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is also documented by them.</v>

2388
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 3>It's in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They returned back at the last moment by</v>

2389
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the Turkish coast guard sent back and</v>

2390
01:45:15.111 --> 01:45:16.850
<v Speaker 3>now they're increasing their actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing really well.</v>

2391
01:45:16.851 --> 01:45:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They started a small business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're incredibly hard working,</v>

2392
01:45:19.881 --> 01:45:21.230
<v Speaker 3>resourceful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful people.</v>

2393
01:45:21.231 --> 01:45:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2394
01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I wish they could come to this </v>

2395
01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:27.280
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd be lucky to have them and they'd be</v>

2396
01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.461
<v Speaker 3>lucky to have us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are an incredible family and if </v>

2397
01:45:30.461 --> 01:45:30.461
<v Speaker 3>you see the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see what I'm talking about.</v>

2398
01:45:30.461 --> 01:45:35.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big point that a lot of people </v>

2399
01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.280
<v Speaker 4>felt was missed at all the criticisms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>immigrants coming over to this country,</v>

2400
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:38.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stock closed the border,</v>

2401
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:43.950
<v Speaker 4>stop allowing Muslims stop allowing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people to come over from these </v>

2402
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:47.500
<v Speaker 4>dangerous areas that somehow know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people would be agents of these </v>

2403
01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 4>dangerous areas coming to destroy our </v>
<v Speaker 4>democracy.</v>

2404
01:45:49.131 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 4>But these people are trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these people are,</v>

2405
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 4>are people that are experiencing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible conditions,</v>

2406
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 4>much like many of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>originally made it to America and the.</v>

2407
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2408
01:45:59.431 --> 01:46:01.140
<v Speaker 3>our country is immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This country is.</v>

2409

<v Speaker 3>he fled Spain during the civil war.</v>

2411
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's passed away.</v>

2412
01:46:07.171 --> 01:46:08.280
<v Speaker 3>He was born in Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29,</v>

2413
01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.270
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>23.</v>

2414
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:13.080
<v Speaker 3>He fled Spain during the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he fled France because of the Nazis</v>

2415
01:46:13.081 --> 01:46:14.490
<v Speaker 3>rolled in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came to this country.</v>

2416
01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:19.820
<v Speaker 3>He was a brilliant physicist and we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky to have him and he was eternally </v>

2417
01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:20.970
<v Speaker 3>lucky to be part of this country as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2418
01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what was odd about trump's try not to</v>

2419
01:46:25.531 --> 01:46:30.531
<v Speaker 3>get political again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got to say what was odd about </v>

2420
01:46:30.531 --> 01:46:32.721
<v Speaker 3>trump's travel ban did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were countries that we'd never </v>

2421
01:46:32.721 --> 01:46:35.811
<v Speaker 3>been attacked by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one from those countries had ever </v>

2422
01:46:35.811 --> 01:46:35.811
<v Speaker 3>attacked this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2423
01:46:35.811 --> 01:46:39.561
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are those countries doing on </v>

2424
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:41.481
<v Speaker 3>the travel ban?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This lunatic that killed people in New </v>

2425
01:46:41.481 --> 01:46:41.481
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Becca.</v>

2426
01:46:41.481 --> 01:46:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Stan like that wasn't on the travel ban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

2427
01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand trying to create a filter </v>

2428
01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 3>that keeps bad people out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2429
01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:52.641
<v Speaker 3>every country does that just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand this specific logic of those </v>

2430
01:46:52.641 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 3>countries on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That made no sense to me.</v>

2431
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:55.360
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made no sense to anybody.</v>

2432
01:46:55.510 --> 01:47:00.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're assuming that everybody in these </v>

2433
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:01.780
<v Speaker 2>areas is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the people that try and escape</v>

2434
01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds insane.</v>

2435
01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:06.190
<v Speaker 2>And that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2436
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:11.050
<v Speaker 2>it's cruel and anti human to not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to have a chance.</v>

2437
01:47:11.051 --> 01:47:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying don't vet these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2438
01:47:12.851 --> 01:47:17.851
<v Speaker 2>Don't interview them and communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and find out what their </v>

2439
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much information as you can get you,</v>

2440
01:47:18.610 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 2>of course you are you concerned because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that has been </v>

2441
01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:24.700
<v Speaker 2>bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was concerned about my own reaction to</v>

2442
01:47:24.701 --> 01:47:29.650
<v Speaker 2>yesterday's mass shooting that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost nonchalant about it.</v>

2443
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2444
01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.520
<v Speaker 2>there's another one like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting numb</v>

2445
01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.660
<v Speaker 3>to mass shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2446
01:47:34.661 --> 01:47:39.661
<v Speaker 3>I ask myself two questions and it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean to ask them and I'm just being </v>

2447
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:43.240
<v Speaker 3>honest and telling people this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked myself,</v>

2448
01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it was a white church or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black church.</v>

2449
01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And I asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if the attacker wasn't Islamic </v>

2450
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:51.280
<v Speaker 3>radical and a foreigner or was he a </v>
<v Speaker 3>homegrown American?</v>

2451
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I assumed it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He obviously.</v>

2452
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2453
01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even know what that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what those questions say about me or </v>

2454
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:01.420
<v Speaker 3>about the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's really interesting.</v>

2455
01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Those are the first things I asked and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like.</v>

2456
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those questions came to my mind so </v>

2457
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something about it that didn't</v>

2458
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:10.360
<v Speaker 3>feel good and they're very obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions to ask.</v>

2459
01:48:10.361 --> 01:48:10.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2460
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:14.800
<v Speaker 3>it's clear that those are very important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to know.</v>

2461
01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:17.440
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't like that it came to me so </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

2462
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

2463
01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.930
<v Speaker 2>It's the exact same questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also felt like it's just,</v>

2464
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:24.380
<v Speaker 2>these are patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're inescapable patterns,</v>

2465
01:48:24.381 --> 01:48:28.730
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the Vegas massacre or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one or the Orlando shootings.</v>

2466
01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:34.150
<v Speaker 2>It's always a man and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a Muslim or is it a crazy white </v>

2467
01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:34.150
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

2468
01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2469
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:38.320
<v Speaker 3>in tribe I write about mass shootings </v>
<v Speaker 3>are a very particular thing.</v>

2470
01:48:38.321 --> 01:48:43.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's gang shootings in Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever that may have a kind of </v>

2471
01:48:43.321 --> 01:48:43.321
<v Speaker 3>logic to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2472
01:48:43.321 --> 01:48:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Like you're controlling turf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's money involved.</v>

2473
01:48:44.591 --> 01:48:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Drugs would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2474
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2475
01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:47.830
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of innocent people get shot.</v>

2476
01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:51.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the price you pay for gang wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a logic to it.</v>

2477
01:48:51.131 --> 01:48:55.000
<v Speaker 3>There is mass shootings are completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic,</v>

2478
01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone killing as many people that</v>

2479
01:48:58.691 --> 01:49:02.320
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know right as possible before</v>
<v Speaker 3>he dies.</v>

2480
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It's totally nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I found,</v>

2481
01:49:06.671 --> 01:49:09.190
<v Speaker 3>and I did a lot of research into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2482
01:49:09.191 --> 01:49:14.191
<v Speaker 3>that those kinds of mass shootings </v>
<v Speaker 3>typically happen in middle class </v>

2483
01:49:14.261 --> 01:49:19.261
<v Speaker 3>communities like otherwise safe middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>class communities or small low crime </v>

2484
01:49:19.391 --> 01:49:24.391
<v Speaker 3>Christian communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have never happened in the inner </v>

2485
01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.620
<v Speaker 3>city even literally never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2486
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:32.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they happen in communities that are </v>

2487
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.090
<v Speaker 3>otherwise very safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very Christian,</v>

2488
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:33.040
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2489
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boring frankly.</v>

2490
01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it really made me wonder like,</v>

2491
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:38.590
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2492
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.410
<v Speaker 3>lots of countries have as many guns as </v>
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>

2493
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Every country has crazy people in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in them,</v>

2494
01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:50.011
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the only that does this to </v>

2495
01:49:50.011 --> 01:49:53.701
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we do it only in a certain kind of </v>

2496
01:49:53.701 --> 01:49:53.701
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2497
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>We're doesn't happen in high crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low income communities,</v>

2498
01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:02.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens in the most sort of like </v>

2499
01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:02.280
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quiet,</v>

2500
01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low crime,</v>

2501
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:05.410
<v Speaker 3>bland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suburban or rural communities.</v>

2502
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.640
<v Speaker 3>That's where it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2503
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:11.410
<v Speaker 3>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that these communities are not</v>

2504
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:16.411
<v Speaker 3>producing crazy people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But somehow those people come to a place</v>

2505
01:50:17.141 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 3>where they think this is a good thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2506
01:50:19.361 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that happening?</v>

2507
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:26.550
<v Speaker 3>My theory is that the deep alienation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suburbs of sort of small town </v>

2508
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:30.520
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>

2509
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:35.550
<v Speaker 3>the lack of real community effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2510
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.220
<v Speaker 3>and the lack of national unity and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pa,</v>

2511
01:50:38.221 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass killings have risen abruptly in</v>

2512
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 3>the last 15 years and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2513
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:43.630
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2514
01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:46.690
<v Speaker 3>you don't murder people in your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>community when that happens.</v>

2515
01:50:46.691 --> 01:50:49.390
<v Speaker 3>It means the community doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least for the murderer.</v>

2516
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:49.610
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2517
01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:55.040
<v Speaker 2>do you see any connection or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider any connection between psych </v>

2518
01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:55.040
<v Speaker 2>drugs?</v>

2519
01:50:55.610 --> 01:51:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many of these people </v>

2520
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:00.610
<v Speaker 3>are on psych drug</v>

2521
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:00.950
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a study that,</v>

2522
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that see if you could find it,</v>

2523
01:51:02.961 --> 01:51:07.961
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They connected all the mass shootings </v>

2524
01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 2>that have happened over the last two </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades with all the different </v>

2525
01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:15.371
<v Speaker 2>medications that people are on and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single one of them was on something or </v>

2526
01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:15.950
<v Speaker 2>was withdrawing from.</v>

2527
01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

2528
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the drugs creating the </v>

2529
01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:24.531
<v Speaker 3>behavior or the drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treating a mental disorder that is self </v>

2530
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.510
<v Speaker 3>is tied to the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good question,</v>

2531
01:51:27.630 --> 01:51:28.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

2532
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:33.331
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to know mass shootings of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nihilistic sort that I'm referring </v>

2533
01:51:33.331 --> 01:51:37.170
<v Speaker 3>to started abrupt abruptly rose in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>

2534
01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2535
01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:44.600
<v Speaker 3>and then doubled since 2006 and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're increasing even more since that.</v>

2536
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2537
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:50.510
<v Speaker 2>mass shooting over the last 20 years has</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing in common and isn't guns.</v>

2538
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is</v>

2539
01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not,</v>

2540
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:56.590
<v Speaker 3>that's not just positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2541
01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:57.810
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

2542
01:51:57.850 --> 01:51:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2543
01:51:58.641 --> 01:52:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Correlation doesn't mean it couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>dishing.</v>

2544
01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:05.090
<v Speaker 3>It could be the depression is rising in </v>
<v Speaker 3>alienated communities and the depression</v>

2545
01:52:05.091 --> 01:52:07.070
<v Speaker 3>is getting treated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessfully treated with drugs.</v>

2546
01:52:07.071 --> 01:52:10.340
<v Speaker 3>All these people were on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really what's happening is that,</v>

2547
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and this is true suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

2548
01:52:12.681 --> 01:52:14.030
<v Speaker 3>ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

2549
01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 3>alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are going up in </v>

2550
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 3>society and that's just statistically</v>

2551
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question that I would have about </v>

2552
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 2>this though is that when I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>psyche,</v>

2553
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.980
<v Speaker 2>a psychiatrist about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that the dissociative aspect of</v>

2554
01:52:27.981 --> 01:52:32.981
<v Speaker 2>the psychiatric medications that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the problems that people do not </v>

2555
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:36.311
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel the connection even to </v>

2556
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:36.740
<v Speaker 2>their actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can do something horrific like</v>

2557
01:52:36.741 --> 01:52:41.741
<v Speaker 2>shoot people and they might be even </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that to try to get some feeling.</v>

2558
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's totally possible.</v>

2559
01:52:44.051 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I would also offer this idea</v>

2560
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that the massive national addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent video games is a dissociated </v>

2561
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shooting people,</v>

2562
01:52:53.631 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 1>they're not real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen.</v>

2563
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:56.320
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2564
01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just are connected somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2565
01:52:58.611 --> 01:53:03.611
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying what you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>described happening in the streets of </v>

2566
01:53:03.611 --> 01:53:06.200
<v Speaker 1>America is exactly duplicated digitally </v>
<v Speaker 1>in video games.</v>

2567
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the video games doesn't.</v>

2568
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:12.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't keep you from feeling things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the real world where the psych </v>

2569
01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:12.940
<v Speaker 1>medications do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2570
01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:17.000
<v Speaker 1>but did the experience of shooting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>human targets that aren't real.</v>

2571
01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you incorporate that into how you </v>

2572
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 1>feel about shooting and then you go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the real world,</v>

2573
01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it may not be that hard to particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the age of eight of psych drugs,</v>

2574
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:30.670
<v Speaker 1>drugs and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is sort of endemic in this </v>

2575
01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:30.820
<v Speaker 1>society right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be hard to.</v>

2576
01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 1>To transpose that dissociated experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a video game with digital images </v>

2577
01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:41.771
<v Speaker 1>transpose it onto actual humans in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world if you're sufficiently </v>

2578
01:53:41.771 --> 01:53:41.771
<v Speaker 1>disturbed.</v>

2579
01:53:41.771 --> 01:53:46.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good connection and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting question because I haven't </v>

2580
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:49.501
<v Speaker 1>heard it a discussed when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about war and how kids that grow</v>

2581
01:53:49.761 --> 01:53:52.430
<v Speaker 1>up playing call of duty and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines,</v>

2582
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they get really good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be actually better in combat.</v>

2583
01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.060
<v Speaker 1>They would have the tactics mapped out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their mind better.</v>

2584
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2585
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:01.430
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2586
01:54:01.431 --> 01:54:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2587
01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a TV program called active </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooter,</v>

2588
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like and they go back.</v>

2589
01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I've just heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it.</v>

2590
01:54:07.581 --> 01:54:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I would never watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2591
01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's they go back and recreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They re interview everyone who's </v>

2592
01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 1>survived active shooting incident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate it and now people watch for.</v>

2593
01:54:16.551 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

2594
01:54:17.511 --> 01:54:18.320
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2595
01:54:18.321 --> 01:54:20.420
<v Speaker 1>TV is entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch for entertainment,</v>

2596
01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.270
<v Speaker 1>recreations of acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting incidents that are,</v>

2597
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I think partly the result of the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep alienation that happens in a,</v>

2598
01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:30.040
<v Speaker 1>an immediate obsessed society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2599
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.830
<v Speaker 1>no one's talking to each other.</v>

2600
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect circle,</v>

2601
01:54:32.151 --> 01:54:32.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2602
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:34.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely escalating,</v>

2603
01:54:34.671 --> 01:54:39.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we had the event in New York </v>

2604
01:54:39.671 --> 01:54:41.171
<v Speaker 1>where the guy runs over all those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a couple of days later or </v>

2605
01:54:41.171 --> 01:54:41.840
<v Speaker 1>having the one in taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

2606
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 1>this is happening over the scale of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the year,</v>

2607
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:47.240
<v Speaker 1>one every few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting a once a week.</v>

2608
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2609
01:54:47.991 --> 01:54:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in New York there was an ideology</v>

2610
01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 1>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't nihilistic.</v>

2611
01:54:53.271 --> 01:54:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it felt nihilistic to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to that guy,</v>

2612
01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>he actually believed in what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

2613
01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but the real mass shooters that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just out there to kill as many people as</v>

2614
01:55:02.841 --> 01:55:05.350
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know what the ideology is.</v>

2615
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was dishonorably discharged </v>

2616
01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:10.420
<v Speaker 1>from the military for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

2617
01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So he was in a position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2618
01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:15.610
<v Speaker 1>It was a abuse on his spouse and child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2619
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:19.790
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't have a license to own a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>

2620
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owns whatever guns did he had.</v>

2621
01:55:22.641 --> 01:55:26.420
<v Speaker 1>He got them illegally in Colorado where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he drove to Colorado.</v>

2622
01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

2623
01:55:27.671 --> 01:55:31.010
<v Speaker 1>it was in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got them into Colorado.</v>

2624
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Did he get them at a gun show or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

2625
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2626
01:55:35.481 --> 01:55:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're looking at little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

2627
01:55:37.311 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 1>The real question is how the fuck does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person do something like that?</v>

2628
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean shot babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2629
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Shot five-year-olds and</v>

2630
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

2631
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if he was on a psych </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication or if they know he was,</v>

2632
01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.120
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the staggering numbers of broken </v>

2633
01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:56.120
<v Speaker 4>individuals that are committing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>crimes.</v>

2634
01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:57.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very confusing.</v>

2635
01:55:58.650 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 4>And you think that it's tied to what was</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you were saying too,</v>

2636
01:56:02.521 --> 01:56:07.521
<v Speaker 4>about communities about inner cities </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have impoverished high crime </v>

2637
01:56:08.221 --> 01:56:10.500
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not seeing these things.</v>

2638
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you think because in these high crime</v>
<v Speaker 4>communities are dealing with much more </v>

2639
01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 4>life and death and the struggles much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more real,</v>

2640
01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 4>that they feel more connected?</v>

2641
01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:21.370
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is totally a theory.</v>

2642
01:56:21.371 --> 01:56:26.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the truth is that those awful </v>

2643
01:56:26.371 --> 01:56:30.181
<v Speaker 3>sort of school shootings and mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>shootings in the streets have never </v>

2644
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:32.140
<v Speaker 3>happened in a high crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high crime neighborhood,</v>

2645
01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:37.170
<v Speaker 3>and so one has to wonder what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that for all their very </v>

2646
01:56:37.841 --> 01:56:42.841
<v Speaker 3>real stresses and traumas of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for all of those things,</v>

2647
01:56:43.721 --> 01:56:48.721
<v Speaker 3>there is also more face to face communal</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection in poor neighborhoods than in</v>

2648
01:56:50.321 --> 01:56:52.960
<v Speaker 3>wealthy neighborhoods or in middle class</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods and that,</v>

2649
01:56:52.961 --> 01:56:57.961
<v Speaker 3>that communal connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally meeting people in the </v>

2650
01:56:57.961 --> 01:56:57.961
<v Speaker 3>landing of your apartment building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2651
01:56:57.961 --> 01:56:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Meaning people in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stoop on the street,</v>

2652
01:56:59.891 --> 01:57:01.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>

2653
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:04.910
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of human interactions even </v>
<v Speaker 3>at even in a,</v>

2654
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>in an economically stressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>

2655
01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 3>that those create enough of a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>community that people who might </v>

2656
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.010
<v Speaker 3>otherwise go crazy and turn their guns </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this nihilistic weigh on people,</v>

2657
01:57:17.410 --> 01:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>on innocent people that they just don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

2658
01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Because why would I do that to my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2659
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:27.170
<v Speaker 3>That's the and what I fear in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country is that we're losing the sense </v>

2660
01:57:27.170 --> 01:57:30.541
<v Speaker 3>of what our own people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are our own people and if you're </v>

2661
01:57:30.541 --> 01:57:31.870
<v Speaker 3>doing that in the streets of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighboring town,</v>

2662
01:57:31.871 --> 01:57:32.260
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2663
01:57:32.261 --> 01:57:36.020
<v Speaker 3>clearly there's been some loss of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>some idea of what,</v>

2664
01:57:36.021 --> 01:57:38.920
<v Speaker 3>what we belong to and that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2665
01:57:38.921 --> 01:57:43.921
<v Speaker 3>national service or a congressional </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission that really calls out </v>

2666
01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:47.260
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric that that undermines our sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of who we are as a nation.</v>

2667
01:57:47.261 --> 01:57:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might start at the top changing.</v>

2668
01:57:49.841 --> 01:57:51.820
<v Speaker 3>That might start at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might help.</v>

2669
01:57:51.970 --> 01:57:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's any</v>

2670
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:57.970
<v Speaker 4>incentive that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people experience to be someone </v>

2671
01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:01.640
<v Speaker 4>who creates this big event where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has to</v>

2672
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.530
<v Speaker 3>get them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2673
01:58:03.531 --> 01:58:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2674
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a,</v>

2675
01:58:06.650 --> 01:58:11.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm imagining that someone like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels powerless and insignificant and </v>

2676
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:16.930
<v Speaker 3>abused by society and at least there'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>be famous in their last acts and their </v>

2677
01:58:18.771 --> 01:58:23.771
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to cause a lot of </v>

2678
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:23.771
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to.</v>

2679
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:23.771
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you,</v>

2680
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:26.060
<v Speaker 3>you messed with me my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least for the last five minutes about</v>

2681
01:58:26.061 --> 01:58:31.061
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are the ones that are going to </v>

2682
01:58:31.061 --> 01:58:31.061
<v Speaker 3>be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be begging me for mercy.</v>

2683
01:58:31.061 --> 01:58:32.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I begged you for mercy my whole life.</v>

2684
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you're going to be begging me for </v>
<v Speaker 3>mercy.</v>

2685
01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:35.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally guessing,</v>

2686
01:58:35.751 --> 01:58:37.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just riffing here,</v>

2687
01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be surprised if there was </v>

2688
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>something of that to it.</v>

2689
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a good gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has been a very common </v>

2690
01:58:45.010 --> 01:58:49.291
<v Speaker 2>conversation lately as to whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>you discussed these people and even </v>

2691
01:58:49.291 --> 01:58:53.881
<v Speaker 2>bring up their names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know in some places and some even </v>

2692
01:58:53.881 --> 01:58:55.180
<v Speaker 2>media outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to report on the person.</v>

2693
01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Individual is creating this chaos.</v>

2694
01:58:58.420 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2695
01:58:58.901 --> 01:59:03.700
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I think is a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you love this country,</v>

2696
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:08.730
<v Speaker 3>there is a certain pressure to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best possible country ever.</v>

2697
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:16.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's very painful for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans to actually look at the actual</v>

2699
01:59:17.771 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 3>statistics and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2700
01:59:19.751 --> 01:59:20.980
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with mass shootings,</v>

2701
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:23.170
<v Speaker 3>we were the only country that does this </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ourselves.</v>

2702
01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.930
<v Speaker 3>The only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not another country that has not</v>

2703
01:59:25.931 --> 01:59:28.950
<v Speaker 3>at the rate that we do in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

2704
01:59:28.951 --> 01:59:30.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a rash of knife attacks.</v>

2705
01:59:30.611 --> 01:59:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2706
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:32.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not that it doesn't happen at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2707
01:59:32.471 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 3>but if you really look over the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years is more than that.</v>

2708
01:59:36.161 --> 01:59:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Since the eighties when this shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

2709
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Like we're the only country that does </v>
<v Speaker 3>this regularly to ourselves.</v>

2710
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:43.240
<v Speaker 3>It regularly to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like every month practically.</v>

2711
01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2712
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sign.</v>

2713
01:59:46.631 --> 01:59:51.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your child was acting out in a </v>

2714
01:59:51.631 --> 01:59:51.631
<v Speaker 3>violent way and punching kids in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>playground,</v>

2715
01:59:51.631 --> 01:59:52.000
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2716
01:59:52.001 --> 01:59:52.840
<v Speaker 3>he's in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2717
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:54.970
<v Speaker 3>He's acting out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with this kid?</v>

2718
01:59:54.971 --> 01:59:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Like he's clearly in pain and some kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of pain and he's lashing out.</v>

2719
01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Well the society is in some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>

2720
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it you know,</v>

2721
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:03.730
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2722
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:06.500
<v Speaker 3>you can just miss me as a bleeding heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>

2723
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:07.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2724
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:12.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one could dismiss me as a bleeding </v>

2725
02:00:12.211 --> 02:00:12.211
<v Speaker 3>heart liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2726
02:00:12.211 --> 02:00:12.211
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then what's your,</v>

2727
02:00:12.211 --> 02:00:13.900
<v Speaker 3>what's your question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That my question is what,</v>

2728
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.730
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we in so much pain?</v>

2729
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question that I think might </v>

2730
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.791
<v Speaker 3>begin to lead to an answer of why </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's such high suicide rates in such </v>

2731
02:00:23.791 --> 02:00:24.940
<v Speaker 3>a wealthy society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why there's mass killing,</v>

2732
02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:29.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would begin to answer those </v>

2733
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:29.980
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like that question.</v>

2734
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.590
<v Speaker 3>What's your question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To answer those terrible tragedies.</v>

2735
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 3>What's your question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2736
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying is very compelling.</v>

2737
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

2738
02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it's an aspect of this that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is being considered.</v>

2739
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:43.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think your book is very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to that.</v>

2740
02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I think the questions that you raise and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2741
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:52.590
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various examples that you give </v>

2742
02:00:52.590 --> 02:00:54.060
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really food for thought and I don't</v>

2743
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 2>think it's being discussed in very many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other circles.</v>

2744
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It's everyone's looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric drugs.</v>

2745
02:00:58.721 --> 02:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's looking at the white men with</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns and the gun problem,</v>

2746
02:01:01.901 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 2>the NRA and all these various aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not looking at the root cause of</v>

2747
02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 2>this depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and this detachment that we have</v>

2748
02:01:09.581 --> 02:01:11.050
<v Speaker 2>from our neighbors and our community.</v>

2749
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Somalia has got a lot more guns </v>

2750
02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:16.320
<v Speaker 3>than we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2751
02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:16.320
<v Speaker 3>And there's plenty of violence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Somalia,</v>

2752
02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but no one's walking down the streets of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own neighborhood,</v>

2753
02:01:18.071 --> 02:01:20.620
<v Speaker 3>massacring their own people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only we do that.</v>

2754
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.240
<v Speaker 3>And what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2755
02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:23.140
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>

2756
02:01:23.141 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 3>it's a call to a cry for help by our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

2757
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:26.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2758
02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.920
<v Speaker 3>not by that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying generally the phenomenon </v>

2759
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:31.920
<v Speaker 3>within our society is I kind of cry for </v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

2760
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something is wrong psychically,</v>

2761
02:01:34.361 --> 02:01:39.361
<v Speaker 3>spiritually wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians will say we're not a </v>

2762
02:01:39.361 --> 02:01:39.361
<v Speaker 3>Christian enough country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2763
02:01:39.361 --> 02:01:39.361
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2764
02:01:39.361 --> 02:01:39.361
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2765
02:01:39.450 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2766
02:01:40.281 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

2767
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:44.210
<v Speaker 3>That's not the problem right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are um,</v>

2768
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:49.270
<v Speaker 3>peaceful Muslim societies and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent Christian woods and you can </v>

2769
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.870
<v Speaker 3>correlate it with Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2770
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I think the one thing you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are democracy.</v>

2771
02:01:52.161 --> 02:01:57.161
<v Speaker 3>There were their oppressive societies </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very low violence and their full </v>

2772
02:01:57.161 --> 02:01:59.060
<v Speaker 3>democracies like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lots of violence.</v>

2773
02:01:59.061 --> 02:02:00.920
<v Speaker 3>So it's not the democratic system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2774
02:02:00.921 --> 02:02:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it in my guests and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>only a guest.</v>

2775
02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:08.230
<v Speaker 3>My guest is that a certain amount of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>high suicide rates,</v>

2776
02:02:08.290 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 3>high depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

2777
02:02:10.401 --> 02:02:12.200
<v Speaker 3>drug addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn addiction,</v>

2778
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:17.350
<v Speaker 3>child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass shootings and shootings in the </v>

2779
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:19.961
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guess is that the common denominator </v>

2780
02:02:19.961 --> 02:02:23.351
<v Speaker 3>in all those things is the true </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic lack of communal connection</v>

2781
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:27.650
<v Speaker 3>that many Americans experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2782
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2783
02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a very compelling argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very compelling point that again,</v>

2784
02:02:32.961 --> 02:02:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't see being discussed in very many</v>
<v Speaker 2>other areas and I really appreciate it,</v>
