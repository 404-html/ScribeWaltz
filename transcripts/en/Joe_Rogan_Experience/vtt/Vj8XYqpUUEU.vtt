00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a blog I read about Finn privilege just to sit there.</v>

3
00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:06.981
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

4
00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of saying fat shaming.</v>

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>The other side of saying fat shaming is that being thin you were enjoying thin</v>

6
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>privilege and that by creating success and all that,</v>

7
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>not just dating success but the way people dress you in,</v>

8
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the way you move around in society that you enjoy thin privilege and what</v>

9
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do is compare being in shape with being a white male like</v>

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>white male privilege is white.</v>

11
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Male privilege is almost shameful.</v>

12
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>it's almost shameful to have this white male privilege while people are stuck.</v>

14
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel,</v>

16
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

18
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>like if someone talks about white male privilege,</v>

20
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:44.534
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of,</v>

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>you think of someone being aloof to the concerns of,</v>

22
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>of Brown people and poor people and racism and also allude to the fact that they</v>

23
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>got super lucky.</v>

24
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They got this lucky roll the dice and were born in this way that allows them to</v>

25
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:02.774
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

26
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>if you think about white males thinking about white males and you think about</v>

28
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>

29
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>majority of the like super wealthy people are white males.</v>

30
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the people that are in positions of power,</v>

31
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>whether it's presidents,</v>

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>mayor,</v>

33
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.423
<v Speaker 1>white males,</v>

34
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>so that white male being a white male and have that privilege is almost like</v>

35
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:20.774
<v Speaker 1>being in a pig.</v>

36
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like being the man so thin privilege.</v>

37
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>They've figured out a way to make being fin being a pig.</v>

38
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>You've got to knock willpower of that list.</v>

39
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 2>There is no lack of willpower and fat people willpower's a finite resource.</v>

40
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>You have so much against.</v>

41
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 2>We prove this beyond a doubt.</v>

42
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean willpower?</v>

43
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole book about this now,</v>

44
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 2>and I'm forgetting the name of the author,</v>

45
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 2>but they actually show that there's so many decisions you can make.</v>

46
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this a while back.</v>

47
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 2>There's decision making fatigue and there's x amount of willpower and you can</v>

48
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 2>apply that will power to change the world.</v>

49
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Or you can apply that willpower to say no to the bowl of chips in front of you.</v>

50
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

51
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a fat person and your energy reserves are low,</v>

52
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 2>and I say this from personal experience,</v>

53
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the amount of willpower it takes to get up off the couch and walk across the</v>

54
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>street and do whatever you're going to do,</v>

55
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>it requires a hell of a lot more weird,</v>

56
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 2>more willpower than you would think it would as a healthy person because your</v>

57
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.111
<v Speaker 2>cells aren't working,</v>

58
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the energy,</v>

59
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 2>and yet you get up and you do it in every step you take is sapping your</v>

60
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>willpower in a way a healthy person doesn't have.</v>

61
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

62
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.784
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

63
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Saying that even though willpower is sort of an individual characteristic and</v>

64
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:27.801
<v Speaker 1>some people have it,</v>

65
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.634
<v Speaker 1>some people don't.</v>

66
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>With fat people,</v>

67
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a catch 22 because although they need it to drop away,</v>

68
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna have it because they needed to just move around.</v>

69
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Their energy levels are lower so they have less willpower and they're using the</v>

70
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 2>willpower to do simple things that are effortless for you and it's not</v>

71
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 2>effortless for a fat person.</v>

72
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>That is such an interesting point and one that I really didn't consider.</v>

73
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a very unique point because I,</v>

74
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I never really considered that fat people like,</v>

75
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they can't help themselves.</v>

76
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.203
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they're,</v>

77
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll or it's so much more difficult for them to pass on shitty food than it is</v>

78
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>a regular person.</v>

79
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>think of it like this.</v>

81
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're a regular person that's been privileged.</v>

82
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>What branch of the military army?</v>

83
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 1>How long were you in for?</v>

84
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>

85
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.251
<v Speaker 2>Three years?</v>

86
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:15.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

87
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>six years total.</v>

88
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>

89
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.260
<v Speaker 2>80 two to 85 and then reserves from 85 to eight years.</v>

90
00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's you BA boom.</v>

91
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You out a wig.</v>

92
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>That's just real.</v>

93
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.063
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

94
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you get anything out of being in the military?</v>

95
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

96
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.653
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

97
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

99
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 2>just again,</v>

101
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 2>just being,</v>

102
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 2>being responsible response ability,</v>

103
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.440
<v Speaker 2>the ability to respond.</v>

104
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>People that have gone through that,</v>

106
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting to see.</v>

107
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was a real lazy and Kinda shiftless and never got anything</v>

108
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>done and then went away,</v>

109
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>went to bootcamp,</v>

110
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>came back and this motherfucker always folded his napkin after that.</v>

111
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Sat Up Straight and got shit done and I was like,</v>

112
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.393
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

113
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>They turned this dude around like they're really did.</v>

114
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it today because joining today have a high likelihood of</v>

115
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>either being forced to assassinate someone for the government or finding</v>

116
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a position where you really wouldn't want to be and people are</v>

117
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>shooting out you that don't like Americans and unless it's your calling,</v>

118
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't really recommend it.</v>

119
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn,</v>

120
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>for some people it really is a game changer.</v>

121
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.893
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

122
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.680
<v Speaker 2>And not all.</v>

124
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone can make it through it.</v>

125
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

126
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.403
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

127
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys that kind of washed out during that whole basic training.</v>

128
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 2>What made you join College Fund for Art School?</v>

129
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.913
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

130
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Will you pretty convinced that we weren't going to go to war during those times</v>

131
00:04:58.521 --> 00:04:59.300
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

132
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.133
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

133
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.323
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

134
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

136
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't believe it.</v>

137
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

138
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.183
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

139
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I got appointed to go,</v>

140
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I got a long process,</v>

141
00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 2>but basically it got handed a,</v>

142
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity to go to west point by going to the preparatory school for a year</v>

143
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.363
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

144
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 2>got to the end when I finally got my appointment to go to west point,</v>

145
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 2>they said basically you have to forfeit your army college fund to go to art</v>

146
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.124
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

147
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.280
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't really go into be a career military person.</v>

148
00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I kind of went into get college fund so I can go pursue the arts,</v>

149
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.301
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

150
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:35.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.381
<v Speaker 2>but you're being,</v>

152
00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:36.711
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

153
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I was being my behavior as being ready to forest as far as my,</v>

154
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 2>the way I was excelling as an in the military.</v>

155
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

156
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 2>so it was very tempting to go,</v>

157
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I can be an officer,</v>

158
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.573
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>

159
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.571
<v Speaker 2>And then you get,</v>

160
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.160
<v Speaker 2>it got to that moment where I had to,</v>

162
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:52.311
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

163
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I had to make that decision in that moment.</v>

164
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:59.231
<v Speaker 2>You have basically I had like three hours to check the yes box that accept my</v>

165
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:04.030
<v Speaker 2>appointment or check the no box and you know,</v>

166
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>go back into the regular army.</v>

167
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>And they go back to them,</v>

168
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.080
<v Speaker 2>go to art school and I chose,</v>

169
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I chose art school.</v>

170
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

171
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

172
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 2>if I had not done that,</v>

173
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I would have provided I made it through west point,</v>

174
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 2>which is not a guarantee.</v>

175
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>If I'd have made it through west point,</v>

176
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I would have been in the first Gulf war as a lieutenant.</v>

177
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

178
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

179
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

180
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>it also begs the question,</v>

181
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff begs the question like,</v>

182
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.481
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

183
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>everyone's favorite argument is if you have nothing to hide then what are you</v>

184
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.514
<v Speaker 2>worried about?</v>

185
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that.</v>

186
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 2>What it is is first of all,</v>

187
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>why do you need so much information and what?</v>

188
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 2>What have you done that have made so many people so angry?</v>

189
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>They have to check everyone's email.</v>

190
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the actual cause of all this that never gets addressed.</v>

191
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever we're talking about how this group hates us of that group hates us</v>

192
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 2>and this group is playing.</v>

193
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

194
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

195
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>What did we do?</v>

196
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to go with what you said that the if you have nothing to hide,</v>

197
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.131
<v Speaker 2>because I was just.</v>

198
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get a show up before I came here and I failed miserably,</v>

199
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I was going to talk about,</v>

200
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>did you see that story?</v>

201
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 2>The lawsuit filed from that incident in New Mexico with the driver who didn't do</v>

202
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 2>the full stop leaving Walmart.</v>

203
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>You saw it,</v>

204
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

205
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

206
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

207
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 2>So the police pulled them over for,</v>

208
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>for California,</v>

209
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>stopping the stop sign.</v>

210
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Decide that he looks like he's clenching his buttocks in a weird way,</v>

211
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>and this is the part I love most to a judge and says to the judge while this guy</v>

212
00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 2>is sitting on the side of the road,</v>

213
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 2>he's clenching his buttocks.</v>

214
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:37.581
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way.</v>

215
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 2>I think we have somebody trying to hide drugs in there and the judge goes,</v>

216
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess judging from the story,</v>

217
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

218
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>that would be probable cause.</v>

219
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>So they take this guy to a doctor who refuses to do with the police officers</v>

220
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 2>asked.</v>

221
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 2>So they've got to go to another doctor.</v>

222
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen hours of anal cavity searches,</v>

223
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.153
<v Speaker 2>enemas.</v>

224
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 2>They sedated him and did a colonoscopy.</v>

225
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 2>They examined his stuff right in front of him.</v>

226
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen hours,</v>

227
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.111
<v Speaker 2>found nothing.</v>

228
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 2>X rayed him multiple times,</v>

229
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.053
<v Speaker 2>found nothing,</v>

230
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 2>and then apparently send them a $6,000 bill for the procedure.</v>

231
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>So when you say,</v>

232
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.760
<v Speaker 2>what have you got to hide if any,</v>

233
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

234
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're Heidi,</v>

235
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what can happen to you if.</v>

236
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>And not just that.</v>

237
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 2>What I love is the police department spokesman said,</v>

238
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do anything wrong.</v>

239
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 2>This is policy,</v>

240
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>and we had a judge sign off on it.</v>

241
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.111
<v Speaker 2>So when you say,</v>

242
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>if you have nothing to hide,</v>

243
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.144
<v Speaker 2>what do you care?</v>

244
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.560
<v Speaker 2>This guy had nothing to hide and that happened to him.</v>

245
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Clearly did because he was away.</v>

246
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.081
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

247
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 2>but now now that story's true and the lawsuit,</v>

248
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>claims witnesses and all this kind of stuff and the police officers think</v>

249
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>nothing was wrong there.</v>

250
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to you when you get rid of these protections that keep you</v>

251
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>from being searched willy nilly or anything like that.</v>

252
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>But after a story like that,</v>

253
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the ward was going to be stopped by the police.</v>

254
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to clean this bathroom a weird way.</v>

255
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just the theater of the stories,</v>

256
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

257
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>people that are bought freaks and that's what they're into.</v>

258
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>They're into cops checking them out and treasures up there,</v>

259
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>put secrets up there too.</v>

260
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to take the conversation though.</v>

261
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a great direction.</v>

262
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

263
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

264
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:13.741
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

265
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up that if you search,</v>

267
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 1>someone's asked for 14 hours and there's nothing up there.</v>

268
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That guy should be able to search your house for 28.</v>

269
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>That should be the rule.</v>

270
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to throw firecrackers in there.</v>

271
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And come on,</v>

272
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

273
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>He checked his ass for no reason.</v>

274
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you owe him something.</v>

275
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>What bothers me about that is that there's no penalty that actually affects the</v>

276
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>people who did this.</v>

277
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:35.210
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

278
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>if this guy wins is big lawsuit against them,</v>

279
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the taxpayers who are going to pay that.</v>

280
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>The people who did it don't suffer at all.</v>
