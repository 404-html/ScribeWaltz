00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.843
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Here we are again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe.</v>

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Hello Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you doing man?</v>

5
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:11.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the schedule that you have and </v>

6
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:15.374
<v Speaker 2>the amount of energy and enthusiasm you </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain what the schedule is very </v>

7
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 2>remarkable because you're not stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not slowing down.</v>

8
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had your foot on the gas for like</v>

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>two solid years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make Hay while the sun shines.</v>

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess that was what it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you feel about it?</v>

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>when you have an opportunity that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely preposterous.</v>

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>You're a fool to take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.253
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.543
<v Speaker 1>Sierra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tammy and I have been to 100 cities </v>

16
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>since January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everywhere,</v>

17
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of what keeps us going.</v>

18
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all I have a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ca guys.</v>

20
00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>They're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live nation has been really good.</v>

21
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>They make sure that the theaters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth and,</v>

22
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.263
<v Speaker 1>and we've had no problems at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have lots of people who are </v>

23
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:02.884
<v Speaker 1>helping me with my scheduling and Tammy </v>
<v Speaker 1>travels with me and then the lectures </v>

24
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I really like doing them partly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a different lecture every night and</v>

26
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.754
<v Speaker 1>so that keeps me sharp and it makes sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm thinking about new things all </v>

27
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:16.324
<v Speaker 1>the time and trying to formulate my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts more precisely and there are </v>

28
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>also unbelievably positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's also,</v>

29
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>that's also something that makes it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot easier to do because you know,</v>

30
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I go to a city and there's 1500 to 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people waiting for me there,</v>

31
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:38.191
<v Speaker 1>which is staggering in and of itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever I go and they're all,</v>

32
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>they're listening intently and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

33
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a sophisticated discussion or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least as sophisticated as I can make it.</v>

34
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm communicating directly with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and all the people are there to</v>

35
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 1>try to get their lives together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

36
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling in the,</v>

37
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>in the hall is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really positive.</v>

38
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And then I usually talk to about 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people afterwards and you know,</v>

39
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>they're all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

40
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.123
<v Speaker 1>While many of them they just say hi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're polite and we have a photograph </v>

41
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:06.784
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lots of them have stories about how </v>

42
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.124
<v Speaker 1>they've been putting their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they're thrilled to death </v>

43
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:11.261
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.094
<v Speaker 1>that they're out of the hole they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in or they've started a new business or </v>

45
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.604
<v Speaker 1>they've sold a new business or they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get married or they're going </v>

46
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:18.344
<v Speaker 1>to have some kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they fixed up their relationship </v>

47
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>with their parents or they quit drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

48
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And they're not addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to one guy in Europe,</v>

49
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.883
<v Speaker 1>he'd stop.</v>

50
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was addicted.</v>

51
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

52
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It was something that wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

53
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>he'd stopped for nine months and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine of his friends to quit too.</v>

54
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So he comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like bouncing,</v>

55
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:37.384
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so damn happy that his life is </v>

56
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>better at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

57
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that he had this additional positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on other people.</v>

58
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:43.444
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so fun because I have these </v>

59
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're brief,</v>

60
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but they're very personal and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense,</v>

61
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

62
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.783
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think people have to trust you to </v>

63
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>tell you that their lives weren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>

64
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.683
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to trust you more to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that they're going better now </v>

65
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:01.894
<v Speaker 1>because of course what you want when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone that things are going </v>

66
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.214
<v Speaker 1>better is you want real encouragement </v>
<v Speaker 1>and real sense from the person you're </v>

67
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>talking to that they're happy for you.</v>

68
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>And I am absolutely thrilled to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

69
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.243
<v Speaker 1>A guy was in whole foods this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went down near where I'm staying and </v>

70
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.704
<v Speaker 1>two of the guys that work behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat counter came out to talk to me and </v>

71
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.993
<v Speaker 1>independently and they'd both been </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading my books and watching my </v>

72
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.084
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them said he at a seven year </v>

73
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>old son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really wanted to do right by him.</v>

74
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.373
<v Speaker 1>He was looking for ethical and moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance and he found the books really </v>

75
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>helpful and that it was helping him put </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life together.</v>

76
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:38.244
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so car guy at the car rental place </v>

77
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>last night told me the same thing as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

78
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.164
<v Speaker 1>it's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculously exciting to go </v>

79
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.513
<v Speaker 1>everywhere around the world and to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into airports are to walk down the </v>

80
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>street and have people come up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching you on youtube.</v>

81
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>They often mention you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to what you say.</v>

82
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I've been developing a vision for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

83
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>It's really helped me out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks a lot.</v>

84
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And Jesus like to be able to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

85
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time after time,</v>

86
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>day after day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the place.</v>

87
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 1>That's just absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes go into 100 cities,</v>

88
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>like continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>energizing because it's so positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

90
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all this weird crap in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the press,</v>

91
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:23.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about my dangerous followers and all </v>

92
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>this outright nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so ridiculous.</v>

93
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to 250,000</v>

94
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.664
<v Speaker 1>people in it in seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had one incident that was </v>

95
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>negative in that entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>

96
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no misbehavior on anyone's part.</v>

97
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>We had one heckler who obviously not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan of mine,</v>

98
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>given that he was a heckler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

99
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audiences behave perfectly.</v>

100
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>They all dress up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come in suits,</v>

101
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of young guys,</v>

102
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>they dress up so they have a little suit</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition with me,</v>

103
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>which is quite fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an additional bonus and yeah,</v>

104
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn good joe.</v>

105
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.923
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really fantastic and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think what's going on is it makes me </v>

106
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:07.034
<v Speaker 3>very optimistic because I think that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that new media has </v>

107
00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:11.684
<v Speaker 3>provided as these new avenues for </v>
<v Speaker 3>information to get out there and these </v>

108
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:17.654
<v Speaker 3>new things like these lecture circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time you saw public </v>

109
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.843
<v Speaker 3>lecture circuits that were popular to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tune of thousands and thousands of </v>

110
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:26.834
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the ones that you and Sam Harris </v>

111
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 3>did on Youtube and you know Sam's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with a lot of other people as well.</v>

112
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 3>You're doing them with a bottle of Jay </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Dave Rubin as well.</v>

113
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 3>These are the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a very unique thing,</v>

114
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.053
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also this desire to understand new </v>

115
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.223
<v Speaker 3>paths of behavior and patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and that these are corrective </v>

116
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 3>paths and patterns that can lead you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a more fulfilled and happier life.</v>

117
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.163
<v Speaker 3>And recognize the pitfalls of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of behavior that people just fall </v>

118
00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>into and I think oftentimes the between </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who</v>

119
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 2>lives a fulfilled life and someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives a life filled with disaster is </v>

120
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 2>following incorrect patterns and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing what the correct ones are.</v>

121
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.693
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of good people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that lives shitty lives and they </v>

122
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.534
<v Speaker 2>don't do it because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just dumb or because they're </v>

123
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.073
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it because they've been </v>

124
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>influenced by certain patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fallen into patterns,</v>

125
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.354
<v Speaker 2>whether it's because of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they surround themselves with or the </v>

126
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood that grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are around them and have</v>

127
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:26.534
<v Speaker 2>this way of being and they kind of fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that or it's drugs or alcohol or </v>

128
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.284
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they find a new one and then </v>

129
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
<v Speaker 2>they can slide right into that new one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden they feel energized </v>

130
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.914
<v Speaker 2>and they wake up in the morning instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hung over there getting exercise in </v>

131
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating healthy.</v>

132
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.413
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to think about things </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly and do good things in the </v>

133
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:44.684
<v Speaker 2>momentum of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing those good things leads them to </v>

134
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:49.860
<v Speaker 2>feel good about themselves and energized</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

135
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.773
<v Speaker 2>these are all things that you promote </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I think are genuinely really </v>

136
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 2>significant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important,</v>

137
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but he gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is a gets maligned.</v>

138
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>It gets you get pushed into this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

139
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.543
<v Speaker 2>but if what we were talking about before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast by a small select group of </v>

140
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.894
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very small but vocal minority </v>

141
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.363
<v Speaker 2>that wants to misrepresent you and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the periphery that listen to </v>

142
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 2>this small group and then they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pair it those words out without any real</v>

143
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>thinking about what you've said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I have made a </v>

145
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 2>mistake about in the past that I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized in the last couple of weeks was</v>

146
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>people often accused me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

148
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>most of the people that listened to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are men.</v>

149
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>when you're accused like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your automatic responses.</v>

151
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.334
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be accused if you weren't </v>

152
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:41.774
<v Speaker 2>doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there must be something wrong about </v>

153
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.851
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

154
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it 50 percent women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've said things like,</v>

155
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the people who watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos are men.</v>

157
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that 80 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who watch my videos are men.</v>

158
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that surprising given that base </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate?</v>

159
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 2>But then about three weeks ago I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

160
00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

161
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 2>what the hell am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

162
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there some wrong with talking to men?</v>

163
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Is that actually a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I'm trying to,</v>

164
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.553
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't set out to do that </v>

165
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:09.314
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that's the way it's working out </v>

166
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is a majority of men coming to</v>

167
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:13.754
<v Speaker 2>my shows say then is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that s all of a sudden supposed </v>

168
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:18.914
<v Speaker 2>to be a bad thing?</v>

169
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking men to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:21.944
<v Speaker 2>to be more honest and especially in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their speech and their thinking and to </v>

171
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>be more responsible for themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their family and for their community</v>

172
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.033
<v Speaker 2>and to grow up and to shoulder their </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden and to live a responsible and </v>

173
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:35.054
<v Speaker 2>meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And putting those two things together </v>

174
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 2>conceptually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like.</v>

175
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And then there's an accusation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is if there's something wrong.</v>

176
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

177
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 2>why am I even playing into this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

178
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to men,</v>

179
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm encouraging them and I am absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilled every time someone comes up to </v>

180
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:50.894
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

181
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be a 100 times a week or something</v>

182
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>like that and tells me one</v>

183
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 1>of these stories about how they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life together.</v>

184
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm absolutely thrilled about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

185
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:06.201
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a sign of how pathological our</v>

186
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:07.284
<v Speaker 1>times have become in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have been any guilt about </v>

187
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>that to begin with because how is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good thing,</v>

188
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

189
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.701
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

190
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that has to do with this </v>

191
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:17.454
<v Speaker 1>concept that men are running everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that men have this massive </v>

192
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.844
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a white male advantage and </v>

193
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.034
<v Speaker 1>privilege that we all enjoy and share </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that men have this advantage </v>

194
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's disparity in terms of the gender</v>

195
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:35.151
<v Speaker 1>gap in pay and income and that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really a good person,</v>

196
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.953
<v Speaker 1>you would be looking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would be trying to balance that out </v>

197
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and then you wouldn't be trying to pump </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the winning team.</v>

198
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

199
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of that narrative that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>if there's winners there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be losers,</v>

201
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.484
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that there are losers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's winners and that's </v>

202
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:55.840
<v Speaker 1>complete bloody nonsense because as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned that,</v>

203
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 1>and I really believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that every single person who sets out</v>

204
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>to put themselves together ethically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a net positive to everyone around them.</v>

205
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no downside to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

206
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>my book has been criticized by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who've read it very poorly,</v>

207
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:10.884
<v Speaker 1>especially chapter one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about hierarchies that I'm </v>

208
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:14.994
<v Speaker 1>somehow supporting the idea that power </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchy is the right way to be </v>

209
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>and there's absolutely nothing in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written that suggest that at all.</v>

210
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm suggesting that human hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very complex and that the way that </v>

211
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:32.601
<v Speaker 1>you win in a human hierarchy is by being</v>
<v Speaker 1>competent and reciprocal and so and so.</v>

212
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

213
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.173
<v Speaker 1>even if you're selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you got to think very </v>

214
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:39.624
<v Speaker 1>carefully about what that would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were selfish and awake because </v>

215
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.013
<v Speaker 1>you have to work to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and what you want say in this </v>

216
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:47.424
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's you tomorrow and </v>

217
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>there's you next week and there's you </v>
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>

218
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 1>next year and 10 years from now and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're old.</v>

219
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So because you're self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're aware of the future,</v>

220
00:10:58.201 --> 00:10:59.034
<v Speaker 1>you're actually a community unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and if you're selfish and </v>

221
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:03.114
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is that you're serving </v>

222
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.543
<v Speaker 1>the person you are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know in that impulsive way but not </v>

223
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 1>the person you are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not a good grounds for any</v>

224
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:12.414
<v Speaker 1>sort of ethical behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see that if you serve yourself </v>

225
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:16.134
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between serving </v>

226
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 1>your family properly in serving your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community properly.</v>

227
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That those things all mesh in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a harmonious manner.</v>

228
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.833
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really been</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective in the lecture tour is a </v>

229
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:29.214
<v Speaker 1>discussion about that idea and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the relationship </v>

230
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 1>between that and meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

231
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:40.641
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that strikes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience's silent constantly because</v>

232
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm always listening to them to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.313
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the attention is maximally focused </v>

234
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:45.624
<v Speaker 1>is whenever I pointed out to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to the meaninglessness of </v>

235
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:50.724
<v Speaker 1>their life and the suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that they might be </v>

236
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 1>displaying because they're resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter about how things have turned out.</v>

237
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.363
<v Speaker 1>The antidote to that is to take on more </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for themselves and for </v>

238
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>other people and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirational,</v>

239
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 1>which is Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.763
<v Speaker 1>the conservative types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the duty types and I'm not complaining </v>

241
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they're basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

243
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>this is how you should act because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that's your duty,</v>

244
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

245
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how a good citizen would act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a reasonable argument.</v>

246
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But the case that I've been making is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of that.</v>

247
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>

248
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>there is value distinctions between </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

249
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Some things are worth doing and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't.</v>

250
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.134
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of discover what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is for yourself and then you should aim </v>

251
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:32.644
<v Speaker 1>at the things that are most worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll find if you watch </v>

252
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:36.694
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the things that you find worth </v>

253
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>doing are almost always associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an increase in responsibility.</v>

254
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you admire,</v>

255
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.953
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spontaneously admire people and </v>

256
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.234
<v Speaker 1>that's a manifestation of the instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imitate getting people are very </v>

257
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:53.374
<v Speaker 1>imitative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't admire people who don't take </v>

258
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 1>care of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like unless there's something wrong with</v>

259
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:57.761
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

260
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you at least want an admirable person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be accountable for themselves.</v>

261
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.453
<v Speaker 1>And then if they've got something </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover so they can be accountable for </v>

262
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then that's a net.</v>

263
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:07.834
<v Speaker 1>Plus obviously that's someone you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is solid and then maybe they take care </v>

264
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>of some more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a business or they're involved</v>

265
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>in the community in some positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

266
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's a person who's pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is worth imitating.</v>

267
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.063
<v Speaker 1>And so and that's all associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and it's so interesting </v>

268
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's as if it's as if everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of knows this,</v>

269
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but that it hasn't crystallized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

270
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be responsible because that's</v>

271
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>what a good citizen is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's known,</v>

272
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.293
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be responsible because you </v>

273
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>need to have a deep meaning in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>to offset the suffering so you don't get</v>

274
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 1>bitter and the way you do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear a heavy load,</v>

275
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get yourself in check for you now and</v>

276
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.364
<v Speaker 1>for you in the future and then to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same for your family and your community </v>

277
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and that there's real nobility in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's real meaning and more.</v>

278
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting to people,</v>

279
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 1>and I also believe this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the guys that have come</v>

280
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>to talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that have had real,</v>

281
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 1>real rough lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really understand this.</v>

282
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get your act together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you let yourself slide,</v>

283
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>then what kind of moves in to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of what you could have been.</v>

284
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's really not good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

285
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only that if you're living a</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dissolute life,</v>

286
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:18.963
<v Speaker 1>that you're not aiming at anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and so you don't have any real </v>

287
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>meaning and your subsumed by anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that hopelessness.</v>

288
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.450
<v Speaker 1>But something kind of hellish moves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to,</v>

289
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to occupy that place and so then you end</v>

290
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>up making things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you know,</v>

291
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying totalitarian systems,</v>

292
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>whether they were on the right or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

293
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 1>was that part of the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian horrors of the 20th century</v>

294
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 1>manifested themselves was because </v>
<v Speaker 1>average people didn't take on the proper</v>

295
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shut their eyes when they're,</v>

296
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I should have been open even though they</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it and they did and said things</v>

297
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.510
<v Speaker 2>they knew they shouldn't have done and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

298
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And that was what supported those </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible systems.</v>

299
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you leave a little space for hell.</v>

300
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.513
<v Speaker 2>And I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think when things are </v>

301
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 2>happening like something like Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

302
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that were not in supportive,</v>

303
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 2>it felt helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're in Germany,</v>

304
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:15.194
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country is turning towards this </v>

305
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 2>horrible situation where Jewish people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being put on trains.</v>

306
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:23.444
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that didn't speak out in </v>

307
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.884
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily know if it's a lack </v>

308
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:34.781
<v Speaker 2>of discipline or just complete fear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>paralysis and fear for sure.</v>

309
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:36.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of how to deal with it or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to protect your family as well.</v>

311
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 2>So wanting to step out of line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

312
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that if you're going to </v>

313
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.344
<v Speaker 2>forestall that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it early enough because </v>

314
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 2>the longer you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher the price you pay for it.</v>

315
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.103
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to take that jump early </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not exactly sure where </v>

316
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 2>it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

317
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 2>And you're not well and you're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be jumped on.</v>

318
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can see that happening in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own culture.</v>

319
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:04.484
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a mistake on twitter or even </v>

320
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 2>something that isn't a mistake and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

321
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.034
<v Speaker 2>you can pay a well what feels to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty high price or whether it is a </v>

322
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:13.544
<v Speaker 2>high price or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell because twitter is so </v>

323
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>weirdly fictional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

324
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:21.701
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to to get your to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasp on exactly what's going on.</v>

325
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's also your comprehension </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what.</v>

326
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 2>What is the emotional reaction to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't know being mean to you?</v>

327
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Like this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that price and people.</v>

328
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to dismiss that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being not just nothing.</v>

329
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a big deal.</v>

330
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>It causes people to commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has.</v>

331
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:42.944
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullying online has caused many people </v>

332
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 2>to commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

333
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:46.874
<v Speaker 2>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weird thing about that online </v>

335
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.574
<v Speaker 2>communication is that like I find that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to react to a negative twitter </v>

336
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 2>comment as if it's someone sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>across from me talking to me that I know</v>

337
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.143
<v Speaker 2>now it's not and I don't even know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person is real or because their </v>

338
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 2>accounts are often anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

339
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So that person isn't really real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your emotional responses still.</v>

340
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.243
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's gone out of their way to be </v>

341
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:13.020
<v Speaker 2>harshly critical to you.</v>

342
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.173
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't happen that often in </v>

343
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>your day to day life and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a reasonable person,</v>

344
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.773
<v Speaker 2>you're very sensitive to criticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's rare and because you might </v>

345
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.214
<v Speaker 2>be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if there's a lot of people </v>

346
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:27.404
<v Speaker 2>criticizing you because he kind of has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be psychopathic in order to just to </v>

347
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.730
<v Speaker 2>brush that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

348
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like 100 people think I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to that.</v>

349
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.843
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if it's 100 people out of 100 </v>

350
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 2>million but you can't tell on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's irrelevant.</v>

351
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>But if it's a mob of 100 people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>show up outside your house,</v>

352
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:45.890
<v Speaker 2>which is quite kind of what twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like,</v>

353
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well God,</v>

354
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have done something wrong </v>

355
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would all these people be here?</v>

356
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.653
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why so many people </v>

357
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 2>are driven to apologize.</v>

358
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

359
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.353
<v Speaker 2>when they do something on twitter or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then the twitter mobs go </v>

360
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 2>after them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

361
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must've done something wrong.</v>

362
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

363
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do some soul searching.</v>

364
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 2>And so some of that's not even fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like,</v>

365
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it's in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a morality that's misplaced because</v>

366
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>of our inability to calibrate the social</v>
<v Speaker 2>messaging.</v>

367
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've stopped almost completely stopped </v>

368
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.083
<v Speaker 2>reading twitter comments in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>month and I'm definitely better for it </v>

369
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 2>to happier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

370
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too much.</v>

371
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too crazy.</v>

372
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is your number up to now the number of </v>

373
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 2>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a million on twitter.</v>

374
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:37.360
<v Speaker 2>That's when it's about time to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of dodge.</v>

375
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:38.904
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm still following people in </v>

377
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 2>reading what people are posting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

378
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

379
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not worth it.</v>

380
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.593
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

381
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it does have something to do</v>

382
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:48.714
<v Speaker 2>with the technology itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I do believe that that small limit </v>

383
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 2>facilitates angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

384
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:57.740
<v Speaker 2>responding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps souls,</v>

385
00:18:57.741 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 2>you trying to get people to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

386
00:18:59.071 --> 00:18:59.904
<v Speaker 2>But the alternative is facebook where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these long posts that are just </v>

387
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 2>rambling first drafts that people put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

388
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Like when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started ranting about politics or</v>

389
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 2>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get involved.</v>

390
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 2>They're just too big and then people </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump in and comment on them,</v>

391
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>and often their comments are massive as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

392
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.353
<v Speaker 2>It's just too verbose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the good thing about twitter is </v>

393
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it makes you boil down what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to say to a very succinct thing.</v>

394
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Although I do enjoy when someone has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good twitter thread,</v>

395
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 2>like there was a really good twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>thread.</v>

396
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.640
<v Speaker 2>What was that gentleman's name?</v>

397
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Respectable lawyer to belong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Respectable law.</v>

398
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.943
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a long history of the sentinel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people that are uncontacted tribe </v>

399
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 2>in the Indian see where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

400
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.303
<v Speaker 2>the gentleman went there to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission your Christianity and shot </v>

401
00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 2>him four arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote this long history of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and what kind of,</v>

403
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 2>what they've had to endure with being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Speaker 2>a few people going to them and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some awful things and diseases and stuff</v>

405
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:05.810
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

406
00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy when someone will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these long,</v>

407
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.310
<v Speaker 2>like every now and then someone will use</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a novel way.</v>

408
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's um,</v>

409
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is just people just trying </v>

410
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.064
<v Speaker 2>to get a reaction and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction they can get by pissing you </v>

411
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the best one.</v>

412
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also might be the ones that are </v>

413
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:22.824
<v Speaker 2>most like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know exactly know what </v>

414
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.044
<v Speaker 2>motivates people to respond on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might be that the fundamental </v>

415
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:29.874
<v Speaker 2>motivation for twitter response is anger</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than the desire to share </v>

416
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:34.914
<v Speaker 2>something because we don't know anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how these new communication </v>

417
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:37.824
<v Speaker 2>techniques function psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe twitter is skewed 90 percent </v>

418
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>towards people who are impulsively angry</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that moment.</v>

419
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.940
<v Speaker 2>It could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>

420
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.501
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving</v>

422
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>in your car and someone cuts you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you curse,</v>

423
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I do.</v>

424
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.033
<v Speaker 1>And it's often a situational issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than a personality flaw on the </v>

425
00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>part of the other driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's easy to assume that,</v>

426
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.903
<v Speaker 1>but you respond impulsively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God only knows how much of our </v>

427
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.104
<v Speaker 1>social media networks are setup to </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentially reward impulsive </v>

428
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:09.994
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also not that easy to hold </v>

429
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 1>people accountable in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's some utility to that,</v>

430
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but with anonymous accounts and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

431
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the anonymisity immunity is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic because it certainly enables</v>

432
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 1>people to allow their worst to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

433
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

434
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.403
<v Speaker 1>So the only benefit that I can see to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymity is it gives you the </v>

435
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to explore controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas without true,</v>

436
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.600
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think used correctly.</v>

437
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

438
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's true.</v>

439
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.113
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think that it should be </v>

440
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>forbidden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

441
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:45.334
<v Speaker 1>like most things it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its advantages and its </v>

442
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.640
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most things,</v>

443
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not entirely negative to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous.</v>

444
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:51.154
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figured something out that I </v>

445
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:52.654
<v Speaker 1>thought I'd tell you about just took me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 30 years to figure out and I </v>

446
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 1>figured it out on this tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this old idea,</v>

447
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to rescue your father from</v>

448
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

449
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 1>From some monster that's deep in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abyss.</v>

450
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 1>You see that in Pinocchio for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very common idea.</v>

451
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And I figured out why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

452
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.933
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that we already know from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical perspective that you know if </v>

453
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.434
<v Speaker 1>you set out a path towards a goal which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do because you need a goal </v>

454
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 1>and you need a path because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides you with positive emotion,</v>

455
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

456
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So you set up something as valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that implies a hierarchy is set up,</v>

457
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:29.644
<v Speaker 1>something as valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decide that you're going to do that </v>

458
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:32.434
<v Speaker 1>instead of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of a sacrifice because </v>

459
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:35.224
<v Speaker 1>you're sacrificing everything else to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue that and then you experienced a </v>

460
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:39.244
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of positive emotion and meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you watch yourself move towards the </v>

461
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:42.784
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the implication of that is the </v>

462
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 1>better the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the more full enrich your experience</v>

463
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.100
<v Speaker 1>is going to be when you pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the reasons have.</v>

464
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.253
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons for developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vision and for fleshing yourself out </v>

465
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 1>philosophically because you want to aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the highest goal that you can manage.</v>

466
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do that,</v>

467
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.940
<v Speaker 1>and then what you'll find is that as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards the goal,</v>

468
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

469
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>that you have to accomplish that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frighten you.</v>

470
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to learn to be a better </v>

471
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 1>speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better writer,</v>

472
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:11.914
<v Speaker 1>a better thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be better to people around </v>

473
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:14.464
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have to learn some new skills </v>

474
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>and you're afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

475
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to stretch you if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

476
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>if you pursue a goal and it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll put you up against challenges.</v>

477
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the clinical data indicates,</v>

478
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.433
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of safe spaces as Jonathan </v>

479
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:28.923
<v Speaker 1>Heit has been pointing out that what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do when you identify something </v>

480
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:33.814
<v Speaker 1>that someone is avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they need to do because they're </v>

481
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:38.360
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have them voluntary,</v>

482
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily confronted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you break it down.</v>

483
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>What you try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a behavior therapist,</v>

484
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:44.074
<v Speaker 1>as you break down the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're avoiding to smaller and smaller </v>

485
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 1>pieces until you find a piece that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>small enough.</v>

486
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 1>So they'll do it and it doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

487
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.673
<v Speaker 1>As long as they start it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can put the next piece on in the </v>

488
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:54.974
<v Speaker 1>next piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is they don't get less </v>

489
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:58.290
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

490
00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>They get braver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>

491
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's more of you can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

492
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:08.021
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you do something new and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's informative,</v>

493
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.193
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's information in the action and </v>

494
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>then you can incorporate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and turn it into a skill and</v>

495
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:14.654
<v Speaker 1>turn it into a transformation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions so there's more to you </v>

496
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 1>because you've tried something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing,</v>

497
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but the second thing is there's good </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological evidence for this now that if</v>

498
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:31.001
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself in a new situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then new genes code for new proteins and</v>

499
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:35.030
<v Speaker 1>build new neural structures and new </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system structures.</v>

500
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens to some degree when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you work out,</v>

501
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:37.964
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your muscles are responding to </v>

502
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the lote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your nervous system does that too.</v>

503
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

504
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:49.421
<v Speaker 1>You locked in your genetic code and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put yourself in a new situation,</v>

505
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.443
<v Speaker 1>then then the stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the situational stress that's </v>

506
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 1>produced by that particular situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlocks those genes.</v>

507
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.374
<v Speaker 1>And then builds new parts of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's very cool because who </v>

508
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 1>knows how much there is locked inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

509
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now here's the idea.</v>

510
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.953
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that that scales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you take on heavier and heavier </v>

511
00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>loads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that more and more of you,</v>

512
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.753
<v Speaker 1>you get more and more informed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing more and more difficult </v>

513
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more and more of you gets unlocked.</v>

514
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.203
<v Speaker 1>And so then what that would imply is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you got to the point where you </v>

515
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:26.570
<v Speaker 1>could look at the darkest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the abyss,</v>

516
00:25:26.571 --> 00:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the deepest abyss.</v>

517
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.963
<v Speaker 1>If you could look at the harshest things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most brutal parts of the </v>

518
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>suffering of the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence of people in society.</v>

519
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 1>If you could look that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that straight and directly,</v>

520
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.743
<v Speaker 1>that that would turn you on maximally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the idea of rescuing your </v>

521
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:46.664
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because imagine that you're like the </v>

522
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:49.424
<v Speaker 1>potential composite of all your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the ancestral wisdom that's </v>

523
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:54.404
<v Speaker 1>locked inside of you biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not going to come out at all </v>

524
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>unless you stress yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you,</v>

525
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:03.770
<v Speaker 1>unless you challenge yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger the challenge you take on,</v>

526
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.604
<v Speaker 1>the more that's going to turn on and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you take on a broader and </v>

527
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:08.984
<v Speaker 1>broader range of challenges and you push</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself harder than more and more of </v>

528
00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>what you could be turns on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to transforming yourself into</v>

529
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral father into all because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

530
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

531
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:22.754
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of all these living </v>

532
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.753
<v Speaker 1>beings that have come before you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all part of your biological </v>

533
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>potentiality.</v>

534
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.873
<v Speaker 1>And then if you can push yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of that clicks on and that </v>

535
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:36.540
<v Speaker 1>turns you into who you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an,</v>

536
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the re representation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive ancestral father.</v>

537
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you rescue your father </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the beast.</v>

538
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So you think that this ultimate goal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sack of sacrifice and of,</v>

539
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:53.871
<v Speaker 1>of risking your life in order to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's truly important to you,</v>

540
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 1>that this somehow or another maximizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>your potential as a human being?</v>

541
00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

542
00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:00.184
<v Speaker 1>I think you can think about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>religiously to so think about it this </v>

543
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:03.520
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

544
00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>in the Christian story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

545
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you have Christ does two things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>

546
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:12.981
<v Speaker 1>Messianic one is takes the suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world onto himself.</v>

547
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 1>He's not weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

548
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about it psychologically.</v>

549
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe it means that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's your job is the world's full</v>

550
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 1>of suffering and you should accept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as your responsibility past,</v>

551
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and future.</v>

552
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.413
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as much as you can about it and </v>

553
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe you start with your own localized </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

554
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put yourself together,</v>

555
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 1>but then you expand that outward and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that it's,</v>

556
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not a victim of that even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your part and parcel of it,</v>

557
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the potential solution to that.</v>

558
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And so you accept that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

559
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of taking on load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of burying across.</v>

560
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.563
<v Speaker 1>You could look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cross is sort of a symbol of the </v>

561
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 1>place of maximal suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

562
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:58.880
<v Speaker 1>So you accept that as a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as a,</v>

563
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 1>not as something that you're victimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>

564
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you accept that as the price of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

565
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one.</v>

566
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 1>That's one responsibility you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for addressing the suffering</v>

567
00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:09.984
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that could give you some meaning </v>

568
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.113
<v Speaker 1>seemed to me.</v>

569
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing is there's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

570
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:15.924
<v Speaker 1>the Christ met the devil in the desert </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the encounter with </v>

571
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the other thing because</v>

572
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the two major problems that people face </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously are suffering,</v>

573
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.533
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the other thing that </v>

574
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:27.834
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to look at the capacity for </v>

575
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 1>human evil as clearly as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

576
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a very terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

577
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.083
<v Speaker 1>that causes posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and people that aren't </v>

578
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.233
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to it and in the mythologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with the encounter </v>

579
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:42.924
<v Speaker 1>with evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always the case that the </v>

580
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 1>entity that does the encountering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it does it voluntarily,</v>

581
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 1>is is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hurt by it.</v>

582
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So the Egyptian God Horus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

583
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.790
<v Speaker 1>who's the I and the Falcon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that can see and pay attention</v>

584
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 1>when he encounters is evil.</v>

585
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the precursor of Satan,</v>

586
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>he loses an eye because it's no joke to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter malevolence you know it.</v>

587
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.143
<v Speaker 1>It can really shake you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea would be that if you can </v>

588
00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>face the malevolence and you can face </v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering,</v>

589
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.253
<v Speaker 1>then that maximally that opens the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your maximum potential and then the </v>

590
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:24.650
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The optimistic part of that is this is,</v>

591
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 1>this is why it's so useful to peer into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness.</v>

592
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:28.314
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the optimistic part of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that although the suffering is great </v>

593
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:32.664
<v Speaker 1>and the malevolence is his deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to transcendent is </v>

594
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:40.770
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you get out of the most negative</v>

595
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.613
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint is the most positive possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence because one of the things </v>

596
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.154
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to know if you want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know something deep about yourself is </v>

597
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that you could face the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there wasn't prevail,</v>

598
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's correct.</v>

599
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are capable of that.</v>

600
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that despite how tragic life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how malevolent things are,</v>

601
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 1>that fundamentally our spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

602
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.500
<v Speaker 1>has the capacity to to confront that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix it like psychologically,</v>

603
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.013
<v Speaker 1>to to confronted courageously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to bear up under that if you </v>

604
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:13.024
<v Speaker 1>do it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to address it not only to deal </v>

605
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>with it psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to deal with it practically,</v>

606
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and that we could make things much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

607
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.430
<v Speaker 1>There's always</v>

608
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.230
<v Speaker 3>striving towards utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

609
00:30:22.231 --> 00:30:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the ultimate goal that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you ask people,</v>

610
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 3>what would you like out of civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

611
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.423
<v Speaker 3>I'd like everyone to be happy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone to get along and there'd be no </v>

612
00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:30.930
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>

613
00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:32.070
<v Speaker 3>no suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no anything,</v>

614
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.470
<v Speaker 3>but in order to really truly learn about</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and about life,</v>

615
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you have to overcome adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to experience things,</v>

616
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.220
<v Speaker 3>and I firmly believe that in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>truly appreciate love,</v>

617
00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:45.054
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really have felt hate and to really </v>

618
00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:51.300
<v Speaker 3>appreciate comradery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to feel loneliness.</v>

619
00:30:51.301 --> 00:30:54.510
<v Speaker 3>So this is just a part of being a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>

620
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

621
00:30:55.491 --> 00:30:56.324
<v Speaker 1>maybe you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I've been thinking </v>

622
00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.680
<v Speaker 1>along the same lines is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical stories,</v>

624
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.060
<v Speaker 1>in Abrahamic Stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

625
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Abraham basically hangs around his dad's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>

626
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.643
<v Speaker 1>He's like 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of these guys that fails to </v>

627
00:31:10.161 --> 00:31:10.821
<v Speaker 1>launch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:31:10.821 --> 00:31:11.654
<v Speaker 1>in a big way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God eventually gets sick and tired </v>

629
00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:14.690
<v Speaker 1>of him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.553
<v Speaker 1>playing video games in his basement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says get the hell out there into the </v>

631
00:31:18.081 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>world and have life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he does.</v>

632
00:31:20.991 --> 00:31:21.824
<v Speaker 1>He leaves this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father's tent in his community and </v>

633
00:31:24.291 --> 00:31:26.840
<v Speaker 1>his and his country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what he's commanded to do.</v>

634
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.640
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes out and has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>

635
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:29.474
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he encounters is a </v>

636
00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:34.190
<v Speaker 1>famine and then he encounters a tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he encounters a bunch of people</v>

637
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.530
<v Speaker 1>in the state that want to take his wife.</v>

638
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine the Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to that is like,</v>

639
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it was a hell of a lot better sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad's tent playing video games.</v>

640
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.323
<v Speaker 1>But what's cool about that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I realized when I was doing the </v>

641
00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:49.340
<v Speaker 1>lectures on it last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that that was a call to adventure,</v>

642
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

643
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and that the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing what we're talking about</v>

644
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:57.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't that utopia would be a place where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was happy because,</v>

645
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.513
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think because of what you just </v>

646
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.540
<v Speaker 1>laid out is you need that polarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:06.710
<v Speaker 1>and people need a load and we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity and we need difficulty.</v>

648
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.300
<v Speaker 1>We need all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

649
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.943
<v Speaker 1>so maybe what you want is an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest adventure that you could </v>

650
00:32:12.561 --> 00:32:14.660
<v Speaker 1>have and that would involve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:32:14.661 --> 00:32:17.630
<v Speaker 1>something to push against it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve real challenge.</v>

652
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.643
<v Speaker 1>And so just to seek that Dostoevsky knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because when he wrote notes from </v>

653
00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:23.684
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend to </v>

654
00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:25.364
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great book and it's a very short </v>

655
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:27.584
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

656
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.963
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he criticized socialist utopia back in </v>

657
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.990
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 weight way before it became this sort</v>

658
00:32:35.991 --> 00:32:38.240
<v Speaker 1>of widespread idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is now.</v>

659
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And what does the FCC said was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

660
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 1>human beings are these very peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

661
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:44.024
<v Speaker 1>And if you gave us a utopia so that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had nothing to do but eat cake and busy </v>

662
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 1>ourself with the continuation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

663
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was his line,</v>

664
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first thing we do is smash it </v>

665
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:56.950
<v Speaker 1>all to bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that something unexpected and,</v>

666
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.853
<v Speaker 1>and troublesome would happen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're built for adventure and not for </v>

667
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 1>peace and happiness.</v>

668
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Lower designed to overcome the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

669
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.783
<v Speaker 3>The natural world is filled with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural world is filled with things </v>

670
00:33:08.191 --> 00:33:11.340
<v Speaker 3>trying to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is just everywhere you look.</v>

671
00:33:11.341 --> 00:33:12.174
<v Speaker 3>That's all you observed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You observed predators and prey and </v>

672
00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:15.840
<v Speaker 3>animals eating vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

673
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.273
<v Speaker 3>And I think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this concept of overcoming adversity so </v>

674
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.953
<v Speaker 3>it's so human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so a part of what we are that I </v>

675
00:33:24.331 --> 00:33:27.720
<v Speaker 3>want to bring it back to you because one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that I've been considering</v>

676
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.613
<v Speaker 3>is that I've said this many times and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just had a conversation with my good </v>

677
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:33.930
<v Speaker 3>friend Steve Rinella the other day where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he brought it up independently.</v>

678
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.943
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jordan Peterson is the most </v>

679
00:33:36.001 --> 00:33:38.520
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood and misinterpreted guy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

680
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.890
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are always like,</v>

681
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.030
<v Speaker 3>not just Mrs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

682
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.660
<v Speaker 3>but misstating what you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>misstating what you say,</v>

683
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.360
<v Speaker 3>this opposition to you.</v>

684
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.570
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

685
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.403
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about this gq </v>

686
00:33:51.871 --> 00:33:54.180
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was a,</v>

687
00:33:54.181 --> 00:33:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I thought that one was a far more </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent than the.</v>

688
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.733
<v Speaker 3>And her approach was far better and far </v>
<v Speaker 3>more reasoned and well thought out than </v>

689
00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:03.684
<v Speaker 3>some of the other attacks on you before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the bringing in the varsity level </v>

690
00:34:05.971 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 3>players is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

691
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.603
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is part of what with what </v>

692
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 3>forges this message is that you are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

693
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.850
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>

694
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:19.683
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

695
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.553
<v Speaker 3>Eric Weinstein and I had said about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you're essentially the hoists </v>

696
00:34:24.751 --> 00:34:25.584
<v Speaker 3>Gracie of the intellectual dark web have</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what that means is the </v>

697
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.693
<v Speaker 3>early days of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knew what the best martial art </v>

698
00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:34.374
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea was like it was all these </v>

699
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.073
<v Speaker 3>martial arts that are running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>independently and that they were all </v>

700
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.090
<v Speaker 3>claiming that they had the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

701
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.740
<v Speaker 3>And let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hoists.</v>

702
00:34:43.741 --> 00:34:44.574
<v Speaker 3>Gracie was the one who represented </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and went out there and beat all </v>

703
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 3>these people with superior technique and</v>
<v Speaker 3>superior strategy.</v>

704
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 3>South American?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

705
00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>He's from Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know about him.</v>

706
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:56.054
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he launched this Brazilian Ju and </v>

707
00:34:58.381 --> 00:35:02.730
<v Speaker 3>his family launched his Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu Empire that has since taken over</v>

708
00:35:02.731 --> 00:35:03.564
<v Speaker 3>the world of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you are the one who's consistently </v>

709
00:35:07.081 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 3>engaging in these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the one who's involved.</v>

710
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.413
<v Speaker 3>These valley tuto events where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>debating these people who are coming at </v>

711
00:35:14.131 --> 00:35:14.964
<v Speaker 3>you hostile with notes and I think is as</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable as those moments are like </v>

712
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>who was the woman that said so what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to say?</v>

713
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Newman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

714
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think her approach,</v>

715
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.080
<v Speaker 3>I think she misunder estimated you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she underestimated you.</v>

716
00:35:29.081 --> 00:35:29.914
<v Speaker 3>I think she misinterpreted who you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she thought that she could come at </v>

717
00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 3>you with this Straw man sorta article </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Oh,</v>

718
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

719
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Rather than frame your positions in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very unflattering way,</v>

720
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

721
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.360
<v Speaker 3>It was like the early days of hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gracie guys would come out,</v>

722
00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm flailing and get them in an arm bar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they tap out and they'd go,</v>

723
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda what happened with you.</v>

724
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 3>But now this woman who you had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with in Gq,</v>

725
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 3>she was much more skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was better verbally.</v>

726
00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.400
<v Speaker 3>She's shooting her arguments have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sense to seem more reasonable,</v>

727
00:36:02.401 --> 00:36:03.234
<v Speaker 3>more well read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was able to think on her feet </v>

728
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:05.874
<v Speaker 3>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still these are really important </v>

729
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it</v>

730
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 1>was a funny day because I went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hotel room in Baltimore,</v>

731
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:15.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went out of my way to do it and </v>

732
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>she was hostile to me the second I </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked into the room.</v>

733
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

734
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And that really kind of put me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your,</v>

735
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how so?</v>

736
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she basically told me that we were going</v>

737
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 1>to have the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 1>not so many words that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just there was a coldness to her and</v>

739
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.360
<v Speaker 1>a distaste for me that was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiating from her.</v>

740
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.453
<v Speaker 1>So she had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was animous possessed from a union </v>

741
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:40.344
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about </v>

742
00:36:41.411 --> 00:36:42.244
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways of thinking about that </v>

743
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:45.150
<v Speaker 1>is that she had a chip on her shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and relationship to me,</v>

744
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:50.390
<v Speaker 1>so she'd already formulated who I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her imagination and she was also maybe a</v>

745
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:51.924
<v Speaker 1>form of projection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like I was the embodiment of all the </v>

746
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>things that she found distasteful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's who she was.</v>

747
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.373
<v Speaker 1>So there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no willingness to consider on </v>

748
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:07.671
<v Speaker 1>her part that I could be different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>her preconceptions of.</v>

749
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she was,</v>

750
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:11.783
<v Speaker 1>she was hostile to me in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be if you were prejudiced </v>

751
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 1>against someone right from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

752
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.113
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time it was uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room and by the time and there </v>

753
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:23.604
<v Speaker 1>was a photo shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time the conversation </v>

754
00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:25.914
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was more impatient than I would </v>

755
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.494
<v Speaker 1>normally be because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I do expect from journalists and </v>

756
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Newman was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

757
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And so have some of the other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go on and have gone after me.</v>

758
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:41.270
<v Speaker 1>At least they had the professionalism to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be civil before the interview started.</v>

759
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because there's a certain amount of</v>

760
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 1>politeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that not that I'm owed,</v>

761
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but that someone you're interviewing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>owed.</v>

762
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 1>If they come out of their way to go talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

763
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just human decency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real conflict.</v>

764
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you have this conflict,</v>

765
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:01.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

766
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.993
<v Speaker 1>nice to meet you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming to human beings </v>

767
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>interacting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

768
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On,</v>

769
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

770
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relatively professional.</v>

771
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just professional,</v>

772
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>just professional grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

773
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.140
<v Speaker 1>well we're both here to do a job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've agreed to come but,</v>

774
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.101
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

775
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was palpable enmity in the air.</v>

776
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:20.664
<v Speaker 1>Right to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I actually thought at </v>

777
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.090
<v Speaker 1>the end of that interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Jews,</v>

778
00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:25.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm,</v>

779
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.023
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've done enough interviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I found that I was more </v>

780
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 1>impatient than I would've liked to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

781
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:32.724
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily it doesn't seem to have gone </v>

782
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:34.974
<v Speaker 1>overboard because I'd watching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments on that Gq interview and I </v>

783
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 1>think it's got about four and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>million views,</v>

784
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:41.524
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous number of views and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have said that I was more </v>

785
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:47.920
<v Speaker 1>impatient and a little harsher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>usual,</v>

786
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>which I think is true.</v>

787
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

788
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:51.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm starting to run out of </v>

789
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 1>patience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't good.</v>

790
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:54.454
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to run out of patience </v>

791
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:56.883
<v Speaker 1>because then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will flavor the message that you're </v>

792
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:01.400
<v Speaker 1>putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

793
00:39:01.401 --> 00:39:02.234
<v Speaker 1>And people will take it in the wrong way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll take it in with that </v>

794
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 1>bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

795
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:06.783
<v Speaker 1>When.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is very </v>

796
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:13.050
<v Speaker 1>important is that you don't become </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and well and,</v>

797
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm on this tour for example,</v>

798
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 1>like there's no resentment for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

799
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 1>well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>

800
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:23.720
<v Speaker 1>well this is a lot of work and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around like mad and,</v>

801
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.933
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of organization and it's </v>

802
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:27.724
<v Speaker 1>quite demanding and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all true and that none of </v>

803
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:30.874
<v Speaker 1>that is a complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I decided with Tammy right at the </v>

804
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:34.810
<v Speaker 1>beginning that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

805
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:36.310
<v Speaker 1>first of all that this was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

806
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 1>not a vacation because we're not stupid.</v>

807
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 1>We know you can't have everything at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

808
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky if you get some things that</v>

809
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 1>are good at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

810
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.243
<v Speaker 1>So we're very grateful to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and that I was going to </v>

811
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.600
<v Speaker 1>continue to do this as long as I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled to be in front of the audience.</v>

812
00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:53.434
<v Speaker 1>And then when I meet people afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not looking at the end of the </v>

813
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>line to see when the night ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 1>because I want to be sure that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person that comes to meet me,</v>

815
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 1>president president for absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I am,</v>

817
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I am actually quite taken aback and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled,</v>

818
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I guess is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grateful grads.</v>

819
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Better apps that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>

820
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people,</v>

821
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was in there coming from all over</v>

822
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 1>people fly in from Australia into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

824
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.970
<v Speaker 1>they've flown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've flown,</v>

825
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.150
<v Speaker 1>it's lots of eastern Europeans came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

826
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.313
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making huge tracks or it's guys </v>

827
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 1>who came from like eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took,</v>

828
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.063
<v Speaker 1>took him like 12 hours to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia to come to Finland to watch the </v>

829
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.760
<v Speaker 1>talk there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

830
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

831
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>and then not just a few people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

832
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 1>People are really going way the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their way,</v>

833
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

834
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.693
<v Speaker 1>and then they line up and it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not inexpensive because these </v>

835
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 1>venues are expensive and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

836
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm,</v>

837
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm due and it's the same with the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>

838
00:40:56.901 --> 00:40:57.734
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm doing my best to not take </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this for granted and not get </v>

839
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 1>annoyed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

840
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.830
<v Speaker 1>and that goes for the conflict to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

841
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to have my agent screen out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the more egregious um,</v>

843
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.853
<v Speaker 1>the ones that would just be nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat because there I find them quite </v>

845
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>stressful though I wouldn't say I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding from them,</v>

846
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:24.483
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know to begin with how an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview is going to go and I could </v>

847
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.474
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm done having interviews for </v>

848
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>awhile but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't</v>

849
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 2>help but see that the conflict is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary part of this even though I </v>

850
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:38.654
<v Speaker 2>don't find it pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people think they accused me of </v>

851
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:42.880
<v Speaker 2>being a provocateur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of enjoying the conflict.</v>

852
00:41:42.881 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't enjoy it at all.</v>

853
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.393
<v Speaker 2>It usually takes me about three days to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover from a particularly contentious </v>

854
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:50.894
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 2>because I find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find conflict,</v>

856
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite stressful,</v>

857
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think everyone does.</v>

858
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to pretend you don't,</v>

859
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 2>you're either a sociopath or you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liar.</v>

860
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

861
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Well there are people who seem to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of intellectual combat.</v>

862
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:06.074
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the political types are more like </v>

863
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:08.744
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

864
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.673
<v Speaker 2>but I think they still afterwards feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and if they read the comments and </v>

865
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.400
<v Speaker 2>people are against them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that unease it carries.</v>

866
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think so.</v>

867
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't even know how people deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it because I mean I'm been </v>

868
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:23.200
<v Speaker 2>fortunate because although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I've had a fair bit of negative press </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage,</v>

870
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 2>the comments in on Youtube in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

871
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 2>which is where the bulk of them are and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say among the general public</v>

872
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.593
<v Speaker 2>have been overwhelmingly positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell it would be </v>

873
00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 2>like to be in a world where that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reversed,</v>

874
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:40.200
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.530
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people are against you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this,</v>

876
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen with guests that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had on the show where I've met them</v>

877
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and you see a physical effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them.</v>

878
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 2>You see them beaten down like Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

879
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Those comments are so me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

880
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't read those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't read those.</v>

881
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And you see how it's affecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can't sleep.</v>

882
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:00.400
<v Speaker 2>They real.</v>

883
00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucks with them.</v>

884
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:03.290
<v Speaker 2>They'll stay up for nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

885
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

886
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 2>it's you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

887
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:06.254
<v Speaker 2>you're taking in all of these opinions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hundreds if not thousands of people </v>

888
00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>that you don't even know if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from a healthy place and and most</v>

889
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 2>of those opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would not express it that way.</v>

890
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:19.510
<v Speaker 2>If they were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could get the same message across.</v>

891
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I think you were ignorant to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

892
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:23.504
<v Speaker 2>I think your bias and your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they had an opinion that was </v>

893
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 2>unflattering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they express it to you,</v>

894
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:30.794
<v Speaker 2>they'd be considerate about you and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings as a human being and if they </v>

895
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.144
<v Speaker 2>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't take into consideration </v>

896
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying because this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just an asshole,</v>

897
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.390
<v Speaker 2>but when you just see it in type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just see print.</v>

898
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

899
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:43.450
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

900
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It could be a smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a psycho,</v>

901
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:47.330
<v Speaker 2>it could be a fool.</v>

902
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.050
<v Speaker 2>It could be anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also funny too because the,</v>

903
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 2>the negative comments that are part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media seemed to be just as potent</v>

904
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:56.804
<v Speaker 2>as negative comments in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the positive comments don't seem to </v>

905
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:03.080
<v Speaker 2>be as positive as the positive comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>in real life.</v>

906
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.313
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't,</v>

907
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.173
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem as real and I guess </v>

908
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 2>that's partly because we're wired to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more sensitive to threat and to negative</v>

909
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:11.600
<v Speaker 2>emotion because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

910
00:44:11.601 --> 00:44:13.010
<v Speaker 2>because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can be hurt.</v>

911
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also healthy to,</v>

912
00:44:14.231 --> 00:44:15.064
<v Speaker 2>to not stroke your ego too much if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like concentrating only on </v>

913
00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:18.663
<v Speaker 2>like if there's something distasteful if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to someone's page and they just </v>

914
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:21.704
<v Speaker 2>retweet all the positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say to them because then it has </v>

915
00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:24.894
<v Speaker 2>this sort of reinforcing cycle where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people know that if I say something </v>

916
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:29.690
<v Speaker 2>really positive with Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to retweet me.</v>

917
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Like there are some people they engage</v>

918
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 3>in this sort of commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

919
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:37.880
<v Speaker 3>like you say something positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they retweet you and you know,</v>

920
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little,</v>

921
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.553
<v Speaker 3>it's a little too strokey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get really into that stroke in </v>

922
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

923
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

924
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

925
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess the danger of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of,</v>

926
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 1>of that ego inflation that you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to avoid because that's a bad idea,</v>

927
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:53.630
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>

928
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.463
<v Speaker 3>You've done a wonderful job of avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 3>those waters because this is a new this </v>

929
00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.053
<v Speaker 3>for a guy who's in his fifties who </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes famous out of nowhere and </v>

930
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't just become fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just become famous,</v>

931
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:11.171
<v Speaker 3>but becomes this culturally significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of lightening Rod.</v>

932
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I view you and a lot of these</v>

933
00:45:14.421 --> 00:45:15.680
<v Speaker 3>talks that you're dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these,</v>

934
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.970
<v Speaker 3>these debates like you're having with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this woman at Gq or some of your,</v>

935
00:45:18.971 --> 00:45:19.804
<v Speaker 3>your interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you're expressing </v>

936
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:23.384
<v Speaker 3>yourself in a brave but very </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial way and a lot of people </v>

937
00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:28.364
<v Speaker 3>are paying attention to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you're backing it up with your </v>

938
00:45:30.441 --> 00:45:33.020
<v Speaker 3>research or backing it up with real </v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

939
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:37.600
<v Speaker 3>You're backing up with a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of history of,</v>

940
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.000
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the human race and religion and,</v>

941
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:41.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientific studies that have been </v>

942
00:45:43.551 --> 00:45:44.384
<v Speaker 3>done that show correlations between </v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of behaviors and human </v>

943
00:45:47.151 --> 00:45:49.400
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all this is rich.</v>

944
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

945
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:52.850
<v Speaker 3>It's very rewarding if you could take it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in.</v>

946
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.953
<v Speaker 3>But when it goes against what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the preconceived notions or their </v>

947
00:45:58.041 --> 00:46:00.890
<v Speaker 3>own set of beliefs that they're bringing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your conversations,</v>

948
00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:04.510
<v Speaker 3>into your debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it creates this hostile,</v>

949
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 3>a battle where what you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

950
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.380
<v Speaker 3>is very contrary to the way they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>living their life or the</v>

951
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 1>really saw that in Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia.</v>

952
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

953
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I went to Stockholm twice in Oslo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice in Helsinki twice in Copenhagen,</v>

954
00:46:24.411 --> 00:46:25.244
<v Speaker 1>once in the last month and I spent quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a lot of interviews and a lot </v>

955
00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:33.890
<v Speaker 1>of discussion about the so called gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox.</v>

956
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really put their tails into</v>

957
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:37.634
<v Speaker 1>not in Scandinavia and that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the scandinavians are going to </v>

958
00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:41.984
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with this first because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone the farthest down the road </v>

959
00:46:46.041 --> 00:46:50.360
<v Speaker 1>for like making their society gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal.</v>

960
00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:52.340
<v Speaker 1>But explain that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

961
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.881
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

962
00:46:52.881 --> 00:46:55.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine first of all that there's two</v>

963
00:46:55.701 --> 00:47:00.701
<v Speaker 1>kinds of equality that you might pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One would be equality of opportunity and</v>

964
00:47:00.981 --> 00:47:05.981
<v Speaker 1>so that would mean that there's wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of talent across people regardless</v>

965
00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:09.320
<v Speaker 1>of their type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be.</v>

966
00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

967
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:12.800
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity.</v>

968
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.813
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's talent distributed everywhere </v>

969
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.603
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of a truism and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say a truism of the West in the deepest </v>

970
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:22.124
<v Speaker 1>sense that each of the individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>within those groups should be put in a </v>

971
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:28.280
<v Speaker 1>position where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their talents are.</v>

972
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.233
<v Speaker 1>They're encouraged manifest those </v>
<v Speaker 1>talents partly because that would be </v>

973
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 1>good for them spiritually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

974
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but also because that would be a benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the community,</v>

975
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean talent's rare,</v>

976
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.583
<v Speaker 1>which people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different kinds of </v>

977
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

978
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.573
<v Speaker 1>But in each domain it's rare and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everyone's benefit to exploit </v>

979
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 1>talented people to the maximum possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

980
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:49.984
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're just selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to push for equality of </v>

981
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 1>opportunity because the more talented </v>
<v Speaker 1>people there are out there,</v>

982
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:57.364
<v Speaker 1>the more cool stuff you get to have and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the more diverse and </v>

983
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 1>interesting your life is so.</v>

984
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.483
<v Speaker 1>So you can pursue equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity policies and the </v>

985
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavians have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially trying to knock down barriers</v>

986
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 1>for women in the workplace and by all </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>

987
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.653
<v Speaker 1>by all standard theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Scandinavian countries in places </v>

988
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 1>like the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada to a slightly lesser degree,</v>

989
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done,</v>

990
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:26.254
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone farther than any other </v>

991
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:32.971
<v Speaker 1>countries in pursuing those policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

992
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:34.511
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

993
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and part of the consequence of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of the differences between men</v>

994
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:39.514
<v Speaker 1>and women have been minimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously there's far more women in </v>

995
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:44.164
<v Speaker 1>the workplace and there were 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and in many occupations there's </v>

996
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 1>actually dominance by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's dominance in the universities,</v>

997
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 1>there's dominance in the healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields and so women have poured into the</v>

998
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:53.854
<v Speaker 1>workplace and hypothetically there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with that because it's put a </v>

999
00:48:57.491 --> 00:49:02.491
<v Speaker 1>lot of stress on family structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hypothetically that's for the best.</v>

1000
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:03.363
<v Speaker 1>And because it gives people a broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of choices and it gives everyone </v>

1001
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 1>access to more talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1002
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And then also if you look around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1003
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you see that one of the best predictors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1004
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:12.143
<v Speaker 1>of the probability of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>development in developing countries is </v>

1005
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:15.784
<v Speaker 1>their attitude is the attitude in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries towards equal rights for </v>

1006
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks causal,</v>

1007
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 1>the more positively the country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposed to female rights,</v>

1008
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:27.040
<v Speaker 1>the more likely they are to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically.</v>

1009
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.263
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because that indicates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're open to new ideas or </v>

1010
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 1>something like that are open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

1011
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one kind of equality,</v>

1012
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:35.943
<v Speaker 1>open up the playing field so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a chance to compete and </v>

1013
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 1>cooperate and land and land where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

1014
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Speaker 1>But then the other kind of equality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome.</v>

1015
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 1>So and that's often described as equity </v>
<v Speaker 1>in today's language.</v>

1016
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And so the ultimate equity Utopia would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be take every job,</v>

1017
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.313
<v Speaker 1>every conceivable kind of job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then stratify that by every </v>

1018
00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:57.514
<v Speaker 1>conceivable level of authority within </v>
<v Speaker 1>every job and then ensure that every </v>

1019
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 1>single category of person is represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>in precise,</v>

1020
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.670
<v Speaker 1>a proportion to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their prevalence in the population.</v>

1021
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:13.893
<v Speaker 1>So every job should be 50 percent women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 50 percent man and say 13 percent </v>

1022
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Speaker 1>non western ethnic minority and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to be.</v>

1023
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you could break that down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so and otherwise,</v>

1024
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence of systemic prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1025
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Now first thing to say about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>

1026
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.323
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's impossible is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no limit to the number </v>

1027
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 1>of ways that you can categorize people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into groups so you know,</v>

1028
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:39.914
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about sex and ethnicity and </v>

1029
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:42.650
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe those are the obvious ones,</v>

1030
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 1>but now you have gender and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have ethnicity and you know,</v>

1031
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.013
<v Speaker 1>and then there's attractiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and temperament and height </v>

1032
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and age and socioeconomic background.</v>

1033
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's 20,</v>

1034
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:55.904
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no possible way that you could </v>

1035
00:50:58.971 --> 00:50:59.804
<v Speaker 1>ever regulated society so tightly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single one of those groups was </v>

1036
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:07.754
<v Speaker 1>equally represented in every single one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those occupations at every single </v>

1037
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.924
<v Speaker 1>level of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what they want to concentrate </v>

1038
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The significant ones.</v>

1039
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Men and women and race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1040
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But who's to say those are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant ones?</v>

1041
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't even obvious that they are.</v>

1042
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:21.674
<v Speaker 1>Because I would say that like a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant one is cognitive ability </v>

1043
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.760
<v Speaker 1>because that's a way bigger predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm life success than sex or race.</v>

1044
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:29.923
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even think that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily identified the canonical </v>

1045
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:33.794
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've just decided that gender and race </v>

1046
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're the most obvious,</v>

1047
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 1>but isn't there a problem is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1048
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.640
<v Speaker 1>What they don't do is they don't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1049
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.530
<v Speaker 1>in terms of cognitive ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get on a team.</v>

1050
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't get on like there's people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are sexist yet,</v>

1051
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.593
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that someone is elitist </v>

1052
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their cognitive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1053
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.593
<v Speaker 1>hard to say Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think one of the reasons that </v>

1054
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>elitist prejudice is a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1055
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You could be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

1056
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons that like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1057
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

1058
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.710
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense now that I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1059
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1060
00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:10.784
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing that's quite peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the United States in that regard </v>

1061
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:16.820
<v Speaker 1>is like most working class people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1062
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.253
<v Speaker 1>are far more irritated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual elite than they are with </v>

1063
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 1>the wealthy elite and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they could become wealthy and</v>

1064
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:27.044
<v Speaker 1>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't think they could become </v>

1065
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 1>part of the intellectual elite.</v>

1066
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual elite.</v>

1067
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.673
<v Speaker 1>So those would be the liberal left </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning types that dominate the media </v>

1068
00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 1>and academia are particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1069
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.153
<v Speaker 1>positive in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their attitudes towards the typical </v>

1070
00:52:44.181 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>working class person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're prejudiced and elitist.</v>

1071
00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that that's the case and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're also,</v>

1072
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1073
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:53.144
<v Speaker 1>Patronizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the typical working </v>

1074
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 1>class person say who voted for trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1075
00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.754
<v Speaker 1>very sensitive to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're much more concerned with </v>

1076
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:01.814
<v Speaker 1>the one percent who are the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap than they are the one percent who </v>

1077
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:04.964
<v Speaker 1>are the economic elite because at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that's a game they could </v>

1078
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1079
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.733
<v Speaker 1>it was also because it was caricature is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right of the one percent of the </v>

1080
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:15.643
<v Speaker 1>economically you just think of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in these lofty positions that </v>

1081
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 1>are in control of the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

1082
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:21.164
<v Speaker 1>but the one percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually you think of in terms of </v>

1083
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 1>like some of the more preposterous you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing out of universities now and save</v>

1084
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 1>spaces and oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that too.</v>

1085
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.740
<v Speaker 1>There's two things that there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1086
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.683
<v Speaker 1>there's no appreciation on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual elite for the </v>

1087
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 1>pathologies of rational of rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1088
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1089
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing stupider than a smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who went wrong.</v>

1090
00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:44.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1091
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you can tank on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1092
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this in my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1093
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.533
<v Speaker 1>frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I have a particularly smart </v>

1094
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:54.020
<v Speaker 1>client who's particularly disordered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their personality,</v>

1095
00:53:54.021 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 1>that that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often just,</v>

1096
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 1>that's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unimaginable because there's</v>

1097
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 1>so little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1098
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.194
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1100
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 1>What is your approach to handling </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

1101
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:05.154
<v Speaker 1>Who's like super intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet completely their life is in </v>

1102
00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 1>disarray?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1103
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually,</v>

1104
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I usually take a very practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

1105
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.513
<v Speaker 1>we try to identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I start always in my therapy </v>

1107
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always start with behavioral principles.</v>

1108
00:54:18.961 --> 00:54:19.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1109
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:22.110
<v Speaker 1>well let's see if we can identify a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>

1110
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through negotiation that are really </v>

1111
00:54:24.691 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 1>causing you grief and misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:27.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1113
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with your life as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're concerned.</v>

1114
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.623
<v Speaker 1>And so that often takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion and then we might try to </v>

1115
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:33.384
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's causing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's often very difficult to </v>

1116
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 1>figure out too because it might be Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be something physical,</v>

1117
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be sick in some way because </v>

1118
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:46.170
<v Speaker 1>depression has lots of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is autoimmune related and anxiety can be</v>

1119
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:47.004
<v Speaker 1>a side effect of all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological disorders are eating </v>

1120
00:54:49.321 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>improperly or sleeping badly or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not exercising,</v>

1121
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to kind of keep yourself </v>

1122
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:56.400
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tried to figure out what,</v>

1123
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.533
<v Speaker 1>what's causing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you try to sketch out some </v>

1124
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 1>possible solution that we could both </v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

1125
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.320
<v Speaker 1>And then with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1126
00:55:04.321 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the more intelligent ones,</v>

1127
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often they can come up with all sorts of</v>

1128
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:11.130
<v Speaker 1>reasons why none of this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work or,</v>

1129
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:13.200
<v Speaker 1>or a thousand reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Well usually a thousand reasons why none</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this is going to work.</v>

1131
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.973
<v Speaker 1>And that with people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's useful to turn to their </v>

1132
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:19.884
<v Speaker 1>dreams if they dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's cool </v>

1133
00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 1>about dreams is that even though they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to interpret,</v>

1134
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.403
<v Speaker 1>they never lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes you can take someone </v>

1135
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 1>who's hyper rational and they'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream and they'll tell you the dream and</v>

1136
00:55:31.201 --> 00:55:32.034
<v Speaker 1>then you can work through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation which is a tricky </v>

1137
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:34.554
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dream will tell them something </v>

1138
00:55:36.251 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 1>and there's just no denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1139
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a statement from nature.</v>

1140
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:41.183
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gonna pretend that that's not the </v>

1141
00:55:42.661 --> 00:55:44.100
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1143
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 1>that's often extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1144
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.260
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1145
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1146
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 1>back to the equality issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1147
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what's happened.</v>

1148
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So psychologists have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what's putting a tale,</v>

1149
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 1>not in the tail of the Scandinavians.</v>

1150
00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.633
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists have come to a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent agreement about standard </v>

1151
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 1>personality models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1152
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So there's extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

1153
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and conscientiousness.</v>

1154
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And they look fairly stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross-culturally.</v>

1155
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And that was all done by asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people,</v>

1156
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:17.100
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then grouping them statistically.</v>

1157
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.293
<v Speaker 1>So it was a theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically compute took computational </v>

1158
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 1>power and statistics to find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are how traits group,</v>

1159
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.783
<v Speaker 1>so I'm an extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are sociable and happy and </v>

1160
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.070
<v Speaker 1>neurotic people experience a fair bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>

1161
00:56:34.071 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 1>so that's the positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1162
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:36.484
<v Speaker 1>Dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people are maternal and </v>

1163
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:39.154
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people are competitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of male female </v>

1164
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're conscientious.</v>

1165
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 1>People are dutiful and industrious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly and the open people are creative</v>

1166
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 1>and so those are your basic five </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

1167
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been established and everyone </v>

1168
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 1>more or less agrees on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe there are seven dimensions and</v>

1169
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.920
<v Speaker 1>we've got a questionnaire that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks the five down into 10.</v>

1170
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's called understand myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1171
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:08.050
<v Speaker 1>but basically there's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good consensus consent,</v>

1172
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.180
<v Speaker 1>consensus on the five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1173
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 1>so now soon as you have the five basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits,</v>

1174
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you can ask some questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1175
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:14.764
<v Speaker 1>do men and women differ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you just give the </v>

1176
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:18.663
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can either fill it out yourself or </v>

1177
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 1>have other people fill it out on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behalf.</v>

1178
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could be a teacher,</v>

1179
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.000
<v Speaker 1>could be a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1180
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's all been done and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find is there are systematic differences</v>

1181
00:57:28.721 --> 00:57:29.554
<v Speaker 1>between men and women and the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are that women experience </v>

1182
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 1>more negative emotion and that and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more agreeable than men,</v>

1183
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.953
<v Speaker 1>so and that's borne out by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric evidence because I'm higher </v>

1184
00:57:42.401 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 1>levels of negative emotion are </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in depression and anxiety and</v>

1185
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 1>women are diagnosed with higher levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of depression and anxiety all around the</v>

1186
00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 1>world and with agreeableness.</v>

1187
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:53.853
<v Speaker 1>That's also borne out by the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature in some sense the medical </v>

1188
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:57.724
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociomedical literature because </v>

1189
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.483
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people are more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be incarcerated because it's the best </v>

1190
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:04.174
<v Speaker 1>predictor of being incarcerated even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's not a very good predictor </v>

1191
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.053
<v Speaker 1>and men are incarcerated at about a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one rate compared to women and are </v>

1192
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 1>more likely to be antisocial and conduct</v>
<v Speaker 1>disordered.</v>

1193
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So the personality differences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored in the sociomedical literature.</v>

1194
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1195
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are differences,</v>

1196
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:19.834
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those differences a consequence of </v>

1197
00:58:22.241 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 1>socialization or the biological?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is tricky because</v>

1198
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.533
<v Speaker 1>how much something is social and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much it is biological actually depends </v>

1199
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>on the social circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while here's an example,</v>

1200
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.600
<v Speaker 1>if you have a society where no one has </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat and people are starving,</v>

1201
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 1>then there's a huge cultural effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's intelligence.</v>

1202
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that's mediated by economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>

1203
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 1>even though it's got a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>

1204
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:52.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This starvation.</v>

1205
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.373
<v Speaker 1>So the relationship between biology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures actually partly culturally </v>

1206
00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it complicated.</v>

1207
00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.673
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how the scientists decided to </v>

1208
00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 1>address this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought,</v>

1209
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we rank order countries by how</v>

1210
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.473
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian they're social policies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do with a fair degree of </v>

1211
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 1>reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1212
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you've put the countries where women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>second class citizens at the bottom,</v>

1213
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and you'd put the Scandinavian countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>

1214
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.713
<v Speaker 1>You can get good reliability across </v>
<v Speaker 1>raters for how you would rate those </v>

1215
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:26.984
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then look at the magnitude of the </v>

1216
00:59:28.611 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the egalitarian social policies.</v>

1217
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 1>And so then you'll find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the hypothesis,</v>

1218
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:39.440
<v Speaker 1>if the differences between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>are primary,</v>

1219
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.483
<v Speaker 1>primarily social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then as cultures become more </v>

1220
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women will become more alike.</v>

1221
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened.</v>

1222
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The more egalitarian society and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out the Richard This society,</v>

1223
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>because that's also been discovered now </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more different men and women become.</v>

1224
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the differences are not huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with agreeableness,</v>

1225
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:06.560
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took the average man,</v>

1226
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.453
<v Speaker 1>if took a typical man and a typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman out of the population just </v>

1227
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>randomly and you had to bet that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman was more aggressive than the man,</v>

1228
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd be wrong 60 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's quite a bit of overlap,</v>

1229
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you'd be right 40 percent of the</v>

1230
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.084
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that a lot of </v>

1231
01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:26.384
<v Speaker 1>selection takes place at the extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're only concerned about </v>

1232
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:30.523
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people when they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent and maybe it's only the one in </v>

1233
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>50 most disagreeable person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent and they're all men.</v>

1234
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So you can have quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarity at,</v>

1235
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:42.973
<v Speaker 1>at the average level and big differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the extremes and the extremes is </v>

1236
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>where people do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like employment selection.</v>

1237
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest difference that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered between men and women,</v>

1238
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>and this is the one that gets biggest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Scandinavian countries,</v>

1239
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:57.044
<v Speaker 1>is the interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are more interested in things and </v>

1240
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>women are more interested in people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big difference.</v>

1241
01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's one full standard deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you're</v>

1242
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.413
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to be more interested in </v>

1243
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.134
<v Speaker 1>people than 85 percent of men to be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in people as the 50th </v>

1244
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:17.744
<v Speaker 1>percentile a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to be more interested in </v>

1245
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>things than 85 percent of women to be as</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in things as the typical man.</v>

1246
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you define things?</v>

1247
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Ob Gadgets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gadgets,</v>

1248
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non non non animate things.</v>

1249
01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1250
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tools,</v>

1251
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

1252
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stem fields.</v>

1253
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Because the other thing that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the more egalitarian the society</v>

1254
01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that fewer women go into the stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields,</v>

1255
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>the fewer that's interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:49.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1257
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.053
<v Speaker 1>so now this unraveled in a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is a hugely a relevant </v>

1258
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:56.954
<v Speaker 1>issue politically because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot have equality of opportunity </v>

1259
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>and equality of outcome at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1260
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:04.063
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible because as you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>your society more egalitarian and you </v>

1261
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>open up the opportunity for equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

1262
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.673
<v Speaker 1>you increase how different men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>are are and that changes their </v>

1263
01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>occupational choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if men are more interested</v>

1264
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 2>in things which they are by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial margin than way more of them</v>

1265
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:29.181
<v Speaker 2>are going to be engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't that possibly support this idea</v>

1266
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>that in enforced model of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1267
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 2>of equality would allow people to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves more?</v>

1268
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is almost what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1269
01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Well that is the optimistic viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1270
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.053
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny because the Swedish </v>

1271
01:02:46.081 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 2>foreign minister told me to go crawl </v>
<v Speaker 2>back under the rock that I came out from</v>

1272
01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 2>under when I was in Scandinavia because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was describing this,</v>

1273
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this science.</v>

1274
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I've read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not exactly sure why.</v>

1275
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.033
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she regards me as misogynists because I </v>

1276
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:02.214
<v Speaker 2>think that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think because I've been </v>

1277
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:04.763
<v Speaker 2>putting forward the evidence that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are genuine differences between men and </v>

1278
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:08.214
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she should be held accountable for </v>

1279
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.230
<v Speaker 2>that because that's just a flippant </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to say like you,</v>

1280
01:03:12.231 --> 01:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1281
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:13.323
<v Speaker 2>you should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in a position of power like </v>

1282
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 2>she's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have a very specific argument</v>

1283
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:23.210
<v Speaker 2>saying like for a leader to have such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>base thing to say such a crude,</v>

1284
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:25.344
<v Speaker 2>dumb thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crawl back under the rock that you came </v>

1285
01:03:27.451 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1286
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she was making a joke about </v>

1287
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 2>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think she was.</v>

1288
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 2>The lobsters go onto rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they do the ground cracks.</v>

1289
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bigger lobsters have better rock.</v>

1290
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:36.264
<v Speaker 2>That was another very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Gq thing where the woman was </v>

1291
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:42.580
<v Speaker 2>challenging you on your neurobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neurochemistry and that.</v>

1292
01:03:42.581 --> 01:03:42.931
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1293
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:44.130
<v Speaker 2>hardly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly any.</v>

1294
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:44.993
<v Speaker 2>Hardly any psychologists understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin is associated with </v>

1295
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a truism.</v>

1296
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:53.730
<v Speaker 2>It's been known for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can definitely get back to that.</v>

1297
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very curious about this because this</v>

1298
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 2>idea of enforced equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1299
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.593
<v Speaker 2>Ensuring that there is such a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis played a place on equality </v>

1300
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.820
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have the equal amount of men,</v>

1301
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.673
<v Speaker 2>the equal amount of women and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities are absolutely available </v>

1302
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.530
<v Speaker 2>as much to women as they are to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is enforced.</v>

1303
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 2>This creates an environment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less resistance.</v>

1304
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Now in an environment where there's less</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

1305
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>perhaps women don't feel as compelled to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1306
01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what seems to happen.</v>

1307
01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a look.</v>

1308
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:29.874
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are fewer women mathematicians </v>

1309
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 2>in the higher echelons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1310
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but here's something interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical ability.</v>

1311
01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare,</v>

1312
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 2>so that's the first thing to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1313
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Now it looks like if you look in junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>high that give mathematically gifted men</v>

1314
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.430
<v Speaker 2>and males and females are approximately </v>
<v Speaker 2>as common.</v>

1315
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a little bit of debate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because there is some evidence that</v>

1316
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:54.714
<v Speaker 2>maybe at the very upper extremes there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male advantage just like there's a </v>

1317
01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:58.434
<v Speaker 2>male disadvantage at the low end because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mail distribution for intelligence </v>

1318
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.484
<v Speaker 2>might be flatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the greater married male </v>

1319
01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.520
<v Speaker 2>variability hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been papers putting that forward</v>

1320
01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:09.354
<v Speaker 2>that had been retracted as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pressure from politically correct </v>

1321
01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:12.744
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though greater male variability is </v>

1322
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>actually quite common in the animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom for a variety of reasons.</v>

1323
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.083
<v Speaker 1>Men are more expendable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that males are more expendable in some </v>

1324
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:21.994
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could say that males are more </v>

1325
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>likely to purdue to pursue high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high return strategies.</v>

1326
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>You can look at it either way and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly possible.</v>

1327
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men,</v>

1328
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the males in junior high who happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be mathematically gifted,</v>

1329
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>are less likely to also be verbally </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifted.</v>

1330
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Whereas that doesn't seem to be the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the females,</v>

1331
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.693
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a male math nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then math is pretty logical pathway for </v>

1332
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you because you don't have as many other</v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

1333
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.154
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're a female math nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have other options because you're </v>

1334
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.083
<v Speaker 1>less likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to also be verbally </v>

1335
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.234
<v Speaker 1>gifted and so that's enough to at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>in principle account for some of the </v>

1336
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>reasons why there are fewer women </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians than men.</v>

1337
01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Mathematicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have other options.</v>

1338
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 1>They have other options and there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of complex.</v>

1339
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.053
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of complex reasons like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and so we have this reflects of </v>

1340
01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 1>idea and this is very much the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is like the core idea among</v>

1341
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:22.381
<v Speaker 1>the feminist Neil Marxist types is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's differences in outcome,</v>

1342
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.823
<v Speaker 1>that's that's proof of prejudice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that support for the idea of the </v>

1343
01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:28.864
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal tyranny and that's like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core axiom of the radical left is the </v>

1344
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned.</v>

1345
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>That's that's God for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal tyranny.</v>

1346
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.823
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1347
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:39.723
<v Speaker 1>if it turns out that many of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in outcome between men and </v>

1348
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>women aren't a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1349
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>in fact even get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you reduce the tyrannical aspect of</v>

1350
01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>the patriarch and even the patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect to it.</v>

1351
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Then it makes that theory not only wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>but opposite of the truth,</v>

1352
01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.220
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst kind of wrong.</v>

1353
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:05.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if men are more likely to pursue careers</v>

1354
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:06.064
<v Speaker 1>in the stem fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be the case under </v>

1355
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:10.270
<v Speaker 1>conditions of optimal freedom for men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>

1356
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.313
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to drive income </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparities because the stem fields pay </v>

1357
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>more and they pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because they're scalable,</v>

1358
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>like it's really hard to scale care for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1359
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you work in a daycare,</v>

1360
01:07:21.401 --> 01:07:22.234
<v Speaker 1>you're going to care for three infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to care for 50 because </v>

1361
01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not scalable.</v>

1362
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you're like a software designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's infinitely scalable.</v>

1363
01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:30.124
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a much wider range of possible </v>

1364
01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>of possibility for generating much </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger,</v>

1365
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 1>much larger income pools and much larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>pools of wealth,</v>

1366
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and men are also more likely to work </v>

1367
01:07:43.301 --> 01:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>longer hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you work 10 percent longer hours,</v>

1368
01:07:45.971 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you make 40 percent more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a nonlinear return on.</v>

1369
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>That's good thing for everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to know if you have a job,</v>

1370
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.253
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the guy or the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's working that extra 10 percent </v>

1371
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>because the return on that is non </v>
<v Speaker 1>linear.</v>

1372
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really useful thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are more likely to work outside.</v>

1373
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely to work in dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

1374
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.713
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely to run fulltime </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses rather than part time </v>

1375
01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.270
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1376
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to move in pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their career goals.</v>

1377
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And that all contributes to differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and in,</v>

1378
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>in Uber drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1379
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.583
<v Speaker 2>they make seven percent more money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they drive faster so and so </v>

1380
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good though.</v>

1381
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a high risk,</v>

1382
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.260
<v Speaker 2>high return issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pattern mail.</v>

1383
01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.160
<v Speaker 2>It's common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more risk,</v>

1384
01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:32.023
<v Speaker 2>there's more risk in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's more return as long as you </v>

1385
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:34.424
<v Speaker 2>don't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a pretty common male </v>

1386
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:37.454
<v Speaker 2>pattern is there's more risk is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more return as long as you don't get </v>

1387
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:40.724
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem seems to be when discussing </v>

1388
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:42.974
<v Speaker 2>these things in any way romanticizing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>glorifying male behavior or putting any </v>

1389
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 2>emphasis whatsoever on their being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a positive aspect to a lot of the things</v>

1390
01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 2>that we think of as being negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like aggression or ambition or,</v>

1391
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.060
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or competition.</v>

1392
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.081
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Well the competition amongst men is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1394
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Competition with men against women is </v>
<v Speaker 2>often thought of as cruel.</v>

1395
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that.</v>

1396
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.661
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1397
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1398
01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:12.973
<v Speaker 2>and there's a certain amount of reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that as well because obviously </v>

1399
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:19.730
<v Speaker 2>physical competition is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for that to border on.</v>

1400
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why we were shocked.</v>

1401
01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 2>We were talking before the show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of calling people,</v>

1402
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.843
<v Speaker 2>men and women when referring to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's this very disturbing in </v>

1403
01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:34.400
<v Speaker 2>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trend of transgender women entering into</v>

1404
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.503
<v Speaker 2>these competitions now with women who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are biologically female and dominating </v>

1405
01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:41.780
<v Speaker 2>them and that instead of calling people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>

1406
01:09:41.781 --> 01:09:44.550
<v Speaker 2>let's dispense with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just say,</v>

1407
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a man or woman.</v>

1408
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 2>That's your choice and you can change it</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you want,</v>

1409
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 2>so your man or a woman and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice,</v>

1410
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to have a new rule which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you have an x,</v>

1411
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 2>y chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're an x,</v>

1412
01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 2>y person or an xx person than if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>an x,</v>

1413
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 2>x person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>x,</v>

1414
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 2>y person.</v>

1415
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to engage in physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat with an x,</v>

1416
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:05.870
<v Speaker 2>y person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1417
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Men or one x person mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 2>How would that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're x,</v>

1419
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't engage in physical combat with</v>

1420
01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Xs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1421
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 2>X Ys cannot hit xxs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

1422
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.423
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they can't run in cotton </v>
<v Speaker 2>running contests against them and maybe </v>

1423
01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:22.510
<v Speaker 2>they can't play tennis against them </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing within.</v>

1424
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's just reasonable is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

1425
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is certainly reasonable,</v>

1426
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:30.730
<v Speaker 2>but if you talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially someone like you was,</v>

1427
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:31.603
<v Speaker 2>you were against this bill that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to enforce these pronouns and the </v>

1428
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:37.303
<v Speaker 2>compelling the use of these pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your thought to be transphobic </v>

1429
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:47.020
<v Speaker 2>person because you feel like there maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be some rational discussion about</v>

1430
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>the physical limitations of certain body</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures because that's what it is.</v>

1431
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about my field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1432
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.643
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved in combat sports my </v>

1433
01:10:57.111 --> 01:11:01.070
<v Speaker 2>whole life and there is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not to say that females aren't,</v>

1434
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 2>aren't competent and I mean I had Miriam</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nakamoto on yesterday,</v>

1435
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:05.833
<v Speaker 2>she's a good friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an eight time world champion and </v>

1436
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:09.463
<v Speaker 2>she's a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she doesn't fight against men and </v>

1437
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't fight against men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although she's</v>

1438
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.830
<v Speaker 3>probably could beat a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1439
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She shouldn't have to.</v>

1440
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 3>And she's a tough woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can beat a variety of men.</v>

1441
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really tough man can beat all women.</v>

1442
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:24.841
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1443
01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:26.800
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality.</v>

1444
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.210
<v Speaker 3>And that is definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1445
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.053
<v Speaker 3>and people don't like to hear these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and they don't want to pretend </v>

1446
01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>that you can even out the playing field </v>
<v Speaker 3>with hormones.</v>

1447
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:37.403
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can even at a little there certain </v>

1448
01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:40.014
<v Speaker 3>things like I've always said you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you gave brock Lesnar a sex change </v>

1449
01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:45.024
<v Speaker 3>and put them in a dress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to run through every woman </v>

1450
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 3>that's ever lived in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1451
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>There's not a single woman is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to deal with that bone structure</v>

1452
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.023
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mind that that guy has had with </v>

1453
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 3>testosterone pumping through it for 39 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1454
01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:02.420
<v Speaker 3>So she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just preposterous that even to have</v>

1455
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.910
<v Speaker 3>to have the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

1456
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:04.763
<v Speaker 3>so absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one thing that I was attacked on </v>

1457
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:08.004
<v Speaker 3>more than anything in my entire life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that I think it's ridiculous to </v>

1458
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 3>have a trans woman compete against women</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mixed martial arts.</v>

1459
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to have them do it in chess.</v>

1460
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 3>You want to have them do it in something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nonphysical.</v>

1461
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want them to be a woman.</v>

1462
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.313
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1463
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 3>You want them to be recognized as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

1464
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.030
<v Speaker 3>you sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's Mr.</v>

1465
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 3>compelling people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's one that's going up lately.</v>

1466
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to date a trans woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>than you are some sort of a bigot.</v>

1467
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:37.170
<v Speaker 3>even if you want a family,</v>

1469
01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what you remember in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1470
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>in a brave new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Huxley's book,</v>

1471
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:42.923
<v Speaker 1>It was considered immoral to reject </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone sexual advances because it was </v>

1472
01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.540
<v Speaker 1>prejudicial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1473
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is prejudicial.</v>

1474
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:54.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the seeds.</v>

1475
01:12:54.111 --> 01:12:54.944
<v Speaker 1>So that makes the question even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because the question is at </v>

1476
01:12:57.661 --> 01:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>what point do you have the right to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudices and what?</v>

1477
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we seem to cling </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1478
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:05.843
<v Speaker 1>and I would say rightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we're allowed to be prejudice </v>

1479
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:10.224
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to who we interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually and then and who we choose as </v>

1480
01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:15.630
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's right.</v>

1481
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:18.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the right to association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1482
01:13:18.321 --> 01:13:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you said only up to a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>

1483
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:21.743
<v Speaker 3>This is because this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new logic is kind of leaking into </v>

1484
01:13:25.671 --> 01:13:26.504
<v Speaker 3>your sexual preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now like if you have a problem with </v>

1485
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:30.660
<v Speaker 3>someone being overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1486
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Then you're a scientist or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1487
01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1488
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:35.664
<v Speaker 3>the thing is is that you can't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences without having prejudices </v>

1489
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.310
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1490
01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.010
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big issue.</v>

1491
01:13:41.011 --> 01:13:43.230
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to have any preferences.</v>

1492
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:44.123
<v Speaker 3>How's that gonna work out in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you like to eat or what kind </v>

1493
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 3>of films you enjoy or what kind of books</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read.</v>

1494
01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences.</v>

1495
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:52.590
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually attracted to,</v>

1496
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:58.130
<v Speaker 3>there's new emphasis now trying to draw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that line and say like wait,</v>

1497
01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.113
<v Speaker 3>but it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that are pushing this and I've </v>

1498
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:01.283
<v Speaker 3>almost everybody's pushing back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I find it interesting when these </v>

1499
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:04.224
<v Speaker 3>things come logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a logical conclusion to all these </v>

1500
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:06.924
<v Speaker 3>other things that have been happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is where the rubber hits </v>

1501
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1502
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1503
01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.030
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I.</v>

1504
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1505
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this in debates that I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly where people,</v>

1506
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about prejudice and I've pointed </v>

1507
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:20.734
<v Speaker 2>out to them that they have prejudicial </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitudes with regards to their sexual </v>

1508
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:25.600
<v Speaker 2>preferences because they don't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep with anyone who asks them.</v>

1509
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1510
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that not a prejudice?</v>

1511
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's a prejudice.</v>

1512
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question is under what </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances are prejudices justifiable</v>

1513
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:36.483
<v Speaker 2>and that's a conversation we don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have because we believe that there </v>

1514
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:43.750
<v Speaker 2>are no circumstances whatsoever under </v>
<v Speaker 2>which prejudices are are acceptable.</v>

1515
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice and discrimination.</v>

1516
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I think those two get conflated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1517
01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:49.804
<v Speaker 2>there is a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice and discrimination and all </v>

1518
01:14:53.711 --> 01:14:54.544
<v Speaker 2>totally discrimination has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting your standards in relationship </v>

1519
01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 2>to the task at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you'd hope for that.</v>

1520
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:05.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the appropriate forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>

1521
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like intelligence.</v>

1522
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is.</v>

1523
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Everything isn't the same about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything all the time.</v>

1524
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:12.993
<v Speaker 2>So you discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you rank order things and you need to </v>

1525
01:15:15.191 --> 01:15:17.590
<v Speaker 2>rank order them even to pursue things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are valuable.</v>

1526
01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are so anti hierarchy,</v>

1527
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 2>like the like the radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while there shouldn't be hierarchies,</v>

1528
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:24.911
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1529
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:29.911
<v Speaker 2>then why do something that that argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so foolhardy that it's.</v>

1530
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.473
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to take seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do have to engage in it and I </v>

1531
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 2>think when you engage in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating to watch because</v>

1532
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:41.163
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're playing a game of chess</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone only has a couple of </v>

1533
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.450
<v Speaker 2>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have this strong move that they do,</v>

1534
01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:48.250
<v Speaker 2>but you've got all these other pieces </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1535
01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:49.084
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just keep this game going until </v>

1536
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:53.260
<v Speaker 2>this comes to this logical conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is checkmate.</v>

1537
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.450
<v Speaker 2>There's hierarchies all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1538
01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.850
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean people should suppress </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1539
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean people shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1540
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.543
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean people should enforce </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves or force themselves on other </v>

1541
01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:04.450
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it means.</v>

1542
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It also doesn't mean that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

1543
01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:10.660
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're human hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 2>done well or or or that they're only.</v>

1544
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.553
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that they're good necessarily or </v>

1545
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:13.954
<v Speaker 2>that they're predicated going power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the most pathological </v>

1546
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:17.494
<v Speaker 2>elements of the postmodern types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially people like food is their </v>

1547
01:16:20.621 --> 01:16:21.454
<v Speaker 2>insistence that all hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures are predicated on power and </v>

1548
01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:27.820
<v Speaker 2>that there's nothing other than power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's completely preposterous.</v>

1549
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use examples of plumbers in my </v>

1550
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 2>lectures more recently because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather comical,</v>

1551
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.533
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1552
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.733
<v Speaker 2>on what basis do you hire a plumber?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that there's a hierarchy of </v>

1553
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>plumbers ranging from very successful to</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unsuccessful.</v>

1554
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.281
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

1555
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:44.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes plumbers successful?</v>

1556
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power theory would,</v>

1557
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.433
<v Speaker 2>would imply that there are roving bands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mafioso plumbers who like come </v>

1558
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:53.044
<v Speaker 2>pounding on your door at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and tell you that if you don't </v>

1559
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 2>get their particular posy to fix your </v>
<v Speaker 2>pipes leaking or not,</v>

1560
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.450
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to come and burn down</v>
<v Speaker 2>your house.</v>

1561
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's completely.</v>

1562
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.123
<v Speaker 2>It's completely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to hire someone like a </v>

1563
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:08.284
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the first thing you want to know </v>

1564
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>his reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can they actually fix a pipe because you</v>

1565
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 2>actually want your pipe fixed and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to know,</v>

1566
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they deal with you fairly?</v>

1567
01:17:15.891 --> 01:17:16.724
<v Speaker 2>And part of what's tangled up in that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>all likelihood is do they deal with </v>

1568
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:20.384
<v Speaker 2>their employees fairly because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make their business function </v>

1569
01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:25.250
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the hierarchy of plumbers,</v>

1570
01:17:25.251 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny,</v>

1571
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 2>is almost entirely predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

1572
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And almost every enterprise in the west </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like that.</v>

1573
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Because I keep wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1574
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.270
<v Speaker 2>where the hell is this patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny?</v>

1575
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Like is it massage therapists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it nurses?</v>

1576
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.603
<v Speaker 2>Most nurses are female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get females organized into a </v>

1577
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you do in nursing,</v>

1578
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.213
<v Speaker 2>is that all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that part of the patriarchal tyranny </v>

1579
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:54.350
<v Speaker 2>or is it the fact that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those people are women?</v>

1580
01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean it's no longer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1581
01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it still hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it no longer a tyranny?</v>

1582
01:17:58.930 --> 01:17:59.763
<v Speaker 2>Is it no longer patriarchal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it patriarchal only because </v>

1583
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:02.594
<v Speaker 2>there's men in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it patriarchal because it's a </v>

1584
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of this stuff is so incoherent</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it just all you have to do is think</v>

1585
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:09.284
<v Speaker 2>about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that hasn't been done to any great </v>

1586
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:13.150
<v Speaker 2>degree and it just dissolves in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

1587
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.053
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into a job straight out of </v>

1588
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:17.834
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you leave university and now you're </v>

1589
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 2>entering into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1590
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:23.550
<v Speaker 2>your first year in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1591
01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:24.953
<v Speaker 2>it's just a natural fact of life that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be people that are </v>

1592
01:18:28.191 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 2>further ahead in this race than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're better at what they do.</v>

1593
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Some of the more experienced and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

1594
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are more crooked and snitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>too as well because the.</v>

1595
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 2>But it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the agreeing.</v>

1596
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Everyone agreeing that this is a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.773
<v Speaker 2>This is some sort of a competition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have hierarchies in </v>

1598
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:47.084
<v Speaker 2>competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have people who when </v>

1599
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:51.130
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have people who do </v>
<v Speaker 2>better no matter what the thing,</v>

1600
01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.770
<v Speaker 2>so that's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you said,</v>

1601
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>we could look at it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you.</v>

1602
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume people have problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody can agree on that,</v>

1603
01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:03.290
<v Speaker 2>then we could assume that people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like solutions to those problems,</v>

1604
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:05.390
<v Speaker 2>so we could agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we could say,</v>

1605
01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:08.180
<v Speaker 2>well then if you implement a solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

1606
01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.093
<v Speaker 2>so with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to cooperate and </v>

1607
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:11.954
<v Speaker 2>compete in relationship to the solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's instantly going to produce a </v>

1608
01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy because no matter what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is,</v>

1609
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.163
<v Speaker 2>some people are going to be better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving it than others and then if you </v>

1610
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:21.464
<v Speaker 2>have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put the people who are good at </v>

1611
01:19:22.431 --> 01:19:23.264
<v Speaker 2>solving it at the forefront because then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they solve it faster and cheaper and </v>

1612
01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 2>better and then everybody benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you get a hierarchy,</v>

1613
01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1614
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.613
<v Speaker 2>The people who solve those problems get </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial incentive to solve those </v>

1615
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1616
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And they it and they do that because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of us are greedy and desperate.</v>

1617
01:19:39.261 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1618
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:41.264
<v Speaker 2>we want the people who are good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving the problems to keep solving </v>

1619
01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.233
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what we're trying to do is to </v>

1620
01:19:45.861 --> 01:19:46.694
<v Speaker 2>reward them so that they'll keep doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it even if it's difficult to give them </v>

1621
01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:52.300
<v Speaker 2>some status and extraordinarily if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if necessary.</v>

1622
01:19:52.301 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1623
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the people that are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head of giant industry,</v>

1624
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:56.984
<v Speaker 2>the ceos of super successful companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones that have the giant </v>

1625
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:00.284
<v Speaker 2>yachts and the big houses and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the incentive for people to try to get </v>

1626
01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:04.094
<v Speaker 2>to that position and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no incentive and that there </v>

1627
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>should be no incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you're still gonna have all this</v>

1628
01:20:08.161 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>innovation is ridiculous.</v>

1629
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not how human beings work.</v>

1630
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.910
<v Speaker 2>If human beings are going to work really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

1631
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.833
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of a reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can't be an equal voice and then </v>

1632
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.580
<v Speaker 2>then what you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

1633
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.280
<v Speaker 2>so the right that that would be roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

1634
01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:24.114
<v Speaker 2>a conservative position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can take a left wing </v>

1635
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 2>position that's reasonable and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1636
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are hierarchies,</v>

1637
01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:34.881
<v Speaker 2>but we have to stay awake because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can degenerate into power hungry tyranny</v>

1638
01:20:35.301 --> 01:20:36.134
<v Speaker 2>so that it's no longer competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's political machination and game </v>

1639
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:40.764
<v Speaker 2>playing and tyranny that that produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>the positional positional </v>

1640
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:45.054
<v Speaker 2>differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got to stay awake to that and so </v>

1641
01:20:47.851 --> 01:20:51.120
<v Speaker 2>we got to criticize the hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the fact of hierarchy,</v>

1642
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:51.954
<v Speaker 2>but the structure of hierarchy so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay honest and then we also have to be </v>

1643
01:20:54.511 --> 01:20:56.790
<v Speaker 2>careful because when you do set up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

1644
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 2>then a lot of people collect at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>

1645
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.133
<v Speaker 2>That's the necessary consequence of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few people collecting at the top and so </v>

1646
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:04.884
<v Speaker 2>then you have to be concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people at the bottom and so </v>

1647
01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do to express that concern is one,</v>

1648
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:11.394
<v Speaker 2>you might want to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies so that people have </v>

1649
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 2>different talents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could play different games and a complex</v>

1650
01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:17.424
<v Speaker 2>society is pretty good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still gonna have people who </v>

1651
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.480
<v Speaker 2>stack up at the bottom of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

1652
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are going to be people who are</v>

1653
01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:23.514
<v Speaker 2>sick mentally and physically and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are cognitively impaired or </v>

1654
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you know or have experienced some kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of catastrophe in their life.</v>

1655
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.553
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to set up your system so that </v>

1656
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:34.343
<v Speaker 2>those people don't suffer unduly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because that's bad and partly </v>

1657
01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:40.140
<v Speaker 2>because that destabilizes your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1658
01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the left's place is to speak</v>

1659
01:21:43.921 --> 01:21:44.754
<v Speaker 2>for the speak on behalf of the unjustly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed and the rights position is </v>

1660
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:50.964
<v Speaker 2>to stabilize and maintain functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies and encourage competition </v>

1661
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and encourage competition that's of </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to the whole and,</v>

1662
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.050
<v Speaker 2>and to the individuals within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

1663
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.033
<v Speaker 2>And then the political dialogue is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>continual discussion between the left </v>

1664
01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:06.630
<v Speaker 2>and the right saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1665
01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this hierarchies getting a little too</v>

1666
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:10.470
<v Speaker 2>steep and a little too rigid and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1667
01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well.</v>

1668
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:12.601
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1669
01:22:12.601 --> 01:22:17.070
<v Speaker 2>that's also the fundamental reason for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the necessity of free speech.</v>

1670
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's because that's the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss this.</v>

1671
01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.893
<v Speaker 2>It is the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way of working it out </v>

1672
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.003
<v Speaker 2>and it is the case you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to produce hierarchies if </v>

1673
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:25.974
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pursue things of value </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially going to pre produce </v>

1674
01:22:27.991 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies and they're necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also,</v>

1675
01:22:30.721 --> 01:22:31.554
<v Speaker 2>I have a giant issue with the concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these things are mutually </v>

1676
01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 2>exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't have competition and also</v>

1677
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 2>have a good social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's preposterous idea.</v>

1678
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:41.964
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I really like about </v>

1679
01:22:42.871 --> 01:22:45.390
<v Speaker 2>the psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean Piaget,</v>

1680
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.253
<v Speaker 2>who said I would say the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>foremost expert on games is that he did </v>

1681
01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:53.220
<v Speaker 2>a very careful analysis of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive games.</v>

1682
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's take hockey or soccer.</v>

1683
01:22:55.531 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same example.</v>

1684
01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.253
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1685
01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>because people now they have kids play </v>
<v Speaker 2>these games and don't keep score,</v>

1686
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.903
<v Speaker 2>which of course the kids keep score </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not stupid like the </v>

1687
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1688
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>while we</v>

1689
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 4>can't have it be competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1690
01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 4>so let's take it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1691
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:10.203
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is hockey a competitive game or a </v>

1692
01:23:11.351 --> 01:23:12.940
<v Speaker 4>cooperative game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1693
01:23:12.941 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so first of all,</v>

1694
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 4>everyone's trying to do the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cooperative.</v>

1695
01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not like half the people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing chess and another,</v>

1696
01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a third of them brought a basketball and</v>

1697
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.373
<v Speaker 4>two of them are boxing and well </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they do in hockey boxing in a </v>

1698
01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:27.094
<v Speaker 4>corner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone's trying to do the same </v>

1699
01:23:28.181 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's cooperative.</v>

1700
01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone plays their position.</v>

1701
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.380
<v Speaker 4>That's cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all followed the same rules.</v>

1702
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.330
<v Speaker 4>That's cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1703
01:23:37.331 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's competition,</v>

1704
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's nested inside a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of cooperation.</v>

1705
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 4>And the cooperation is the cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the basis of the game itself.</v>

1706
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:50.283
<v Speaker 4>Let's all arbitrarily agree that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>important to put this black disk in the </v>

1707
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.094
<v Speaker 4>net,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to get your aim right and then </v>

1708
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:56.644
<v Speaker 4>let's cooperate within our teams to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because we're going to pass and </v>

1709
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:01.930
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to pass each other and we're</v>

1710
01:24:01.931 --> 01:24:04.420
<v Speaker 4>also going to work so that each of us is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good player,</v>

1711
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:05.254
<v Speaker 4>but so that we all work for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>betterment of our team because we want </v>

1712
01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:10.630
<v Speaker 4>to win games across multiple games.</v>

1713
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.590
<v Speaker 4>So that's also cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you want to interact with your,</v>

1714
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:17.830
<v Speaker 4>your enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say the other team in a way that's</v>

1715
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 4>indicative of good sportsman ship so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the entire league can flourish.</v>

1716
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 4>And to think of that as competitive is </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1717
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:26.100
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1718
01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.233
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no other way of describing it </v>

1719
01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 4>than stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

1720
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:32.530
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1721
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 4>it's an ignorant unit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dimensional analysis.</v>

1722
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.003
<v Speaker 4>It's put forward by someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflexively opposed to anything that </v>

1723
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 4>smacks of competition and who isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking it through at all.</v>

1724
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:42.963
<v Speaker 3>They're denying the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and the fact that they </v>

1725
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:49.170
<v Speaker 3>reaped those benefits of competition by </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying the products that are created</v>

1726
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.460
<v Speaker 4>by these corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1727
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very hypocritical and.</v>

1728
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:53.611
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1729
01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:55.590
<v Speaker 4>That's called a performative </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradiction.</v>

1730
01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:56.311
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1731
01:24:56.311 --> 01:24:57.144
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to complain about left wing </v>

1732
01:24:58.561 --> 01:24:59.930
<v Speaker 4>issues on my iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1733
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:00.841
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1734
01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:01.441
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1735
01:25:01.441 --> 01:25:02.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

1736
01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:03.684
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to have a little gratitude for the </v>

1737
01:25:04.681 --> 01:25:05.514
<v Speaker 4>fact that you've got your iphone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>complain about and those and those </v>

1738
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:08.783
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those corporations are unbelievably </v>

1739
01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:12.324
<v Speaker 4>competitive unblend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fall apart almost instantly when </v>

1740
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:16.920
<v Speaker 4>that competition starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stops being a,</v>

1741
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:18.053
<v Speaker 4>an issue because then there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>constraint on the behavior of the </v>

1742
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:24.120
<v Speaker 4>behavior of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

1743
01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:25.150
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1744
01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:27.630
<v Speaker 4>the issue with men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think with young men,</v>

1745
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.553
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of the things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to address is that if your </v>

1746
01:25:30.661 --> 01:25:35.040
<v Speaker 4>fundamental presupposition is that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture is a patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1747
01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:39.390
<v Speaker 4>which is an appalling presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with the idea that the best way of</v>

1748
01:25:39.391 --> 01:25:41.940
<v Speaker 4>looking at history is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the oppression,</v>

1749
01:25:41.941 --> 01:25:44.220
<v Speaker 4>the continual oppression of women by </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

1750
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:48.270
<v Speaker 4>Which is also something that I regard as</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely reprehensible doctrine.</v>

1751
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.591
<v Speaker 4>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1752
01:25:49.591 --> 01:25:51.030
<v Speaker 4>so it's a patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1753
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.103
<v Speaker 3>but in their defense that did exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has been continual oppression of </v>

1754
01:25:56.071 --> 01:25:56.904
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the only thing that's </v>

1755
01:25:57.691 --> 01:25:58.770
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1756
01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.230
<v Speaker 3>there's been women that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>revered.</v>

1757
01:26:01.231 --> 01:26:03.030
<v Speaker 3>There's been women that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrated.</v>

1758
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>There's been women that</v>

1759
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 2>have accomplished great things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been a lot of oppression.</v>

1760
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.513
<v Speaker 2>So if they concentrate primarily on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression and that's their main point </v>

1761
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>of study and that's the thing they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about all the time.</v>

1762
01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 2>They kind of have a point in the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're looking at all the events</v>

1763
01:26:17.001 --> 01:26:17.834
<v Speaker 2>that have ever taken place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a significant number of them </v>

1764
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:21.950
<v Speaker 2>that have been women being oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real thing.</v>

1765
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.863
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's more women </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've been oppressed than men who've </v>

1766
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:27.230
<v Speaker 2>been oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good point.</v>

1767
01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that the entire history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1768
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.793
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we oppress ourselves personally </v>

1769
01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 2>with our own malevolence and stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're all oppressed by the kind</v>

1770
01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 2>of the crushing hand of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1771
01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:43.400
<v Speaker 2>That molds us in one way and not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1772
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 2>and then of course nature is doing her </v>
<v Speaker 2>best all the time to give birth to us,</v>

1773
01:26:48.051 --> 01:26:53.051
<v Speaker 2>but also to kill us and take us out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's this endless like there's</v>

1774
01:26:53.661 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 2>this endless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

1775
01:26:55.761 --> 01:26:56.594
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability that characterizes our </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence psychologically and socially </v>

1776
01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:00.644
<v Speaker 2>and naturally and I would say a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 50 years ago that was even more </v>

1777
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 2>intense than it was now.</v>

1778
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.473
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the typical person in the west </v>

1779
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 2>lived on less than a dollar a day before</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

1780
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:09.434
<v Speaker 2>95,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the way I think that we should </v>

1781
01:27:12.471 --> 01:27:13.304
<v Speaker 2>view the history of the world is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women labored under virtually </v>

1782
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:16.784
<v Speaker 2>impossible conditions for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulk of human evolution and they did </v>

1783
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:20.954
<v Speaker 2>their best to cooperate and to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to cooperate so that they had some </v>

1784
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:27.403
<v Speaker 2>modicum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some possibility of a modicum of </v>

1785
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 2>security and satisfaction and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the right framework.</v>

1786
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:34.844
<v Speaker 2>And then within that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there's power games that are </v>

1787
01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:38.490
<v Speaker 2>played by people who are corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Within that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's horrible events.</v>

1789
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a.</v>

1790
01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:42.523
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive amount of hypocritical</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking when you are criticizing the </v>

1791
01:27:46.251 --> 01:27:47.084
<v Speaker 2>actions of so many people talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people are complicit in these </v>

1792
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:51.644
<v Speaker 2>things while you're carrying around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone that's made by someone who gets a </v>

1793
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.160
<v Speaker 2>dollar a day.</v>

1794
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a journalist in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Slovenia,</v>

1795
01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:01.730
<v Speaker 2>a who was a lefty and not a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated one,</v>

1796
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 2>and she was talking about the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent and I said,</v>

1797
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:05.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that if you make more than </v>

1798
01:28:06.561 --> 01:28:07.394
<v Speaker 2>$32,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year that you're part of the one </v>

1799
01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1800
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:10.731
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

1801
01:28:10.731 --> 01:28:11.181
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1802
01:28:11.181 --> 01:28:13.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the worldwide statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1803
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.700
<v Speaker 2>so you're part of the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1804
01:28:15.701 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 2>she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1805
01:28:16.851 --> 01:28:17.271
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1806
01:28:17.271 --> 01:28:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

1807
01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:19.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1808
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:23.570
<v Speaker 2>You can look it up yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was so interesting was that for</v>

1809
01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterization,</v>

1810
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:28.063
<v Speaker 2>the one percent victimizers was only </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant within the confines of her </v>

1811
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:33.280
<v Speaker 2>national border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1812
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Soon as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1813
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:35.594
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all you have to do is expand that </v>

1814
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit and you're the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not the solution.</v>

1815
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.003
<v Speaker 2>Then that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was completely untenable for her </v>

1816
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:42.703
<v Speaker 2>exam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't include herself in the </v>

1817
01:28:43.671 --> 01:28:48.140
<v Speaker 2>population of victimizers even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>she lives in a Western country and she's</v>

1818
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:51.230
<v Speaker 2>a well paid journalist and she's lived a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very privileged life,</v>

1819
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:55.320
<v Speaker 2>so to speak by historical standards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone living in the Congo or something</v>

1820
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.363
<v Speaker 2>or or or anybody living anywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire history of the human race </v>

1821
01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.113
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1822
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make $34,000</v>

1823
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:05.064
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely are in the top one </v>

1824
01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 1>percent of everybody who's ever though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1825
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:08.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1826
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1827
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1828
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Especially given what you can buy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1829
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 1>The only reason denied that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fit what you've come into.</v>

1830
01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 1>The argument with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1831
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:22.491
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fit your pre k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre predisposed notion that you have</v>

1832
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.910
<v Speaker 1>though your idea that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so rigid.</v>

1833
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:27.923
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you are not one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that's just carrying that iphone </v>

1834
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.433
<v Speaker 1>with that laptop and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you enjoy that are created </v>

1835
01:29:37.861 --> 01:29:41.940
<v Speaker 1>by these corporations that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You support them financially,</v>

1836
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but yet they're the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying this earth.</v>

1837
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:47.160
<v Speaker 1>These are the ones that you're rallying </v>
<v Speaker 1>against these,</v>

1838
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you hate against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:49.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the victim,</v>

1840
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:52.320
<v Speaker 1>victimizer narrative only works if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're a victim.</v>

1841
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:53.213
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you assume that you're a </v>

1842
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 1>victimizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it's not so much fun.</v>

1843
01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I wrote the forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the new version of of Solzhenitsyn's</v>

1844
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abridged version.</v>

1845
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:05.004
<v Speaker 1>It came out November first and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out why the Russian </v>

1846
01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:08.844
<v Speaker 1>revolution went wrong so rapidly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went wrong right from the beginning </v>

1847
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sold units and quotes.</v>

1848
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:18.220
<v Speaker 1>This guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name was Walter Lapsis,</v>

1849
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got the part right anyways,</v>

1850
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:22.013
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're interrogating a member of </v>

1851
01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:24.684
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeoisie to decide whether they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they constitute an enemy of the </v>

1852
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:31.224
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't give any credibility to such </v>

1853
01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 1>niceties as individual guilt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>

1854
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:36.984
<v Speaker 1>All you care about is their group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their background and their economic </v>

1855
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they're in the wrong group,</v>

1856
01:30:41.491 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeoisie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's it.</v>

1857
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of them and and comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the end of them,</v>

1858
01:30:47.881 --> 01:30:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but the end of their children and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren as well,</v>

1859
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 1>and lots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was eventually executed by Stalin.</v>

1860
01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wrote me and just told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>after I wrote the forward,</v>

1861
01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I figured out was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1862
01:30:58.111 --> 01:30:59.940
<v Speaker 1>and this is really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1863
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 1>So the intersection will claim is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1864
01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.660
<v Speaker 1>each person has more than one group </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

1865
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So fundamentally if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate their victim status,</v>

1866
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:11.154
<v Speaker 1>then you have to calculate it across all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different groups that they might be </v>

1867
01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:16.260
<v Speaker 1>victims in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

1868
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1869
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.713
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a native American is one form of victim </v>

1870
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:21.834
<v Speaker 1>in this line of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a native American victim is female </v>

1871
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 1>is like twice the victim or however you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would calculate that mathematically.</v>

1872
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1873
01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:31.884
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can be put into six different </v>

1874
01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:34.764
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about that a little </v>

1875
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the bloody rub.</v>

1876
01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 1>If I put you in six groups in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those groups,</v>

1877
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:45.000
<v Speaker 1>you're a victimizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bloody well bed on it.</v>

1878
01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.253
<v Speaker 1>And then here's the next rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a victimizer among any </v>

1879
01:31:49.501 --> 01:31:53.640
<v Speaker 1>possible dimension of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's the gulag for you.</v>

1880
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the fundamental danger of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that group identity,</v>

1881
01:31:57.391 --> 01:31:58.500
<v Speaker 1>victimizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim,</v>

1882
01:31:58.501 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>new narrative is that you</v>

1883
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 4>fragment your identity of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimensions.</v>

1884
01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 4>You'll find out that you're a victimizer</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then everyone,</v>

1885
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.350
<v Speaker 4>then everyone's a criminal and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's guilty.</v>

1886
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what happened in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you think,</v>

1887
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:11.914
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

1888
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 4>There were a bunch of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 4>really compassionate about the poor.</v>

1889
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like let's say just for the sake of</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>

1890
01:32:16.751 --> 01:32:18.490
<v Speaker 4>that at the beginning of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolution,</v>

1891
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 4>that 20 percent of the communists were </v>
<v Speaker 4>really concerned about the poor.</v>

1892
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we could say 50 percent just to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary about it.</v>

1893
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.730
<v Speaker 4>The other 50 percent were jealous and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful about anyone who anything more</v>

1894
01:32:30.731 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 4>than they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1895
01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:32.944
<v Speaker 4>Now that you put those two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>head to head in a battle for four years </v>

1896
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:36.034
<v Speaker 4>and see who's standing at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you are one of those utopians </v>

1897
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:42.730
<v Speaker 4>who actually cares for the dispossessed </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the revolution comes,</v>

1898
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 4>you can bloody well be sure that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>head's going to be first on the chopping</v>

1899
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:46.384
<v Speaker 4>block because the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated by hate are going to be a lot </v>

1900
01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 4>more vicious in their attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eradicate.</v>

1901
01:32:50.951 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 4>Then you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it,</v>

1902
01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:54.094
<v Speaker 4>effective in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your attempts to save that whole </v>

1903
01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:57.604
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That whole identity politics game that </v>

1904
01:32:58.841 --> 01:32:59.674
<v Speaker 4>is dangerous beyond belief and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated fundamentally on resentment </v>

1905
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 4>and the desire to devolve people back </v>
<v Speaker 4>into tribal antagonism.</v>

1906
01:33:08.210 --> 01:33:09.043
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so important that you talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it this way and I think it's </v>

1907
01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.410
<v Speaker 3>really interesting what I see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance.</v>

1908
01:33:12.411 --> 01:33:13.244
<v Speaker 3>Do you talk about it this way and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people are unwilling to look at it </v>

1909
01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.073
<v Speaker 3>as this multilevel historical sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>record that you could look and see how </v>

1910
01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:24.104
<v Speaker 3>this played out and you can look and see</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on right now with these </v>

1911
01:33:26.991 --> 01:33:27.824
<v Speaker 3>control games that people are playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>socially and that they are enforcing </v>

1912
01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:32.173
<v Speaker 3>certain types of behavior in certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways of thinking and then trying to </v>

1913
01:33:34.551 --> 01:33:35.384
<v Speaker 3>reign in earnings and raw rally against </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism and support communism and </v>

1914
01:33:40.101 --> 01:33:42.800
<v Speaker 3>socialism and doing so in this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

1915
01:33:42.801 --> 01:33:43.634
<v Speaker 3>trendy way without understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>full scope of the historical </v>

1916
01:33:46.851 --> 01:33:47.684
<v Speaker 3>implications when it's been tried in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>past and that it's not as simple as </v>

1917
01:33:50.301 --> 01:33:51.350
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
01:33:51.351 --> 01:33:52.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1919
01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:56.550
<v Speaker 3>you got this and Ryan thing doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at this world.</v>

1920
01:33:56.551 --> 01:33:57.880
<v Speaker 3>DEB's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1921
01:33:58.160 --> 01:33:58.993
<v Speaker 3>capitalism against socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good people who care about folks </v>

1922
01:34:01.821 --> 01:34:04.820
<v Speaker 3>versus people who are ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that,</v>

1923
01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:06.533
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't even how capitalism doesn't </v>

1924
01:34:07.781 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 4>even work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1925
01:34:09.341 --> 01:34:10.174
<v Speaker 4>that managers are more stressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people they manage than the people they </v>

1926
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:15.470
<v Speaker 4>manage our stress by their managers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1927
01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.450
<v Speaker 4>then think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1928
01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:17.284
<v Speaker 4>Just to all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to think about that for a </v>

1929
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:18.754
<v Speaker 4>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're an employee and you </v>

1930
01:34:20.441 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 4>have a manager and the managers a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a jerk,</v>

1931
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:24.490
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's 28,</v>

1932
01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:26.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's like you're kind of one slash</v>

1933
01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:27.594
<v Speaker 4>20th oppressed by the manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now you're the manager and you're </v>

1934
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:31.084
<v Speaker 4>managing 20 people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for them and we're assuming </v>

1935
01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:34.144
<v Speaker 4>that you're not a psychopath and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not because he probably </v>

1936
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:37.264
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have been able to get to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>manager if you're a psychopath because </v>

1937
01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.413
<v Speaker 4>psychopaths generally aren't very </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful and they have to keep moving </v>

1938
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 4>as people figure out who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that like psychopathic power</v>

1939
01:34:47.621 --> 01:34:48.454
<v Speaker 4>is a good route to power in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>functioning organization is a stupid </v>

1940
01:34:50.831 --> 01:34:51.664
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are some organizations that are </v>

1941
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:56.680
<v Speaker 4>pathological enough so that works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't last very long either.</v>

1942
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 4>So you're the</v>

1943
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 2>manager and you're a decent human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got 20 people who are </v>

1944
01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 2>dependent on you and at least two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are real trouble.</v>

1945
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they are serious trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

1946
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.233
<v Speaker 2>They're your concern all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see this as and as people </v>

1947
01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.124
<v Speaker 2>move up the corporate hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think while they have more and more </v>

1948
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:15.880
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1949
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not really.</v>

1950
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 2>They have more and more responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their behavior is actually monitored</v>

1951
01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:24.013
<v Speaker 2>with increasing severity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're quite constrained in </v>

1952
01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:28.814
<v Speaker 2>most high level positions of authority </v>
<v Speaker 2>in complex organizations like you have </v>

1953
01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:33.974
<v Speaker 2>to behave pretty damn carefully or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get yourself in trouble </v>

1954
01:35:36.081 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

1955
01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 2>We'll start today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that wasn't necessarily the</v>

1956
01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:40.964
<v Speaker 2>case a decade ago or two decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was less the case unless the case </v>

1957
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:46.700
<v Speaker 2>today it's far easier to get called out </v>
<v Speaker 2>on things,</v>

1958
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:50.150
<v Speaker 2>but he but even so like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even 20 years ago,</v>

1959
01:35:50.151 --> 01:35:50.984
<v Speaker 2>like if you didn't treat your customers </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and carefully reciprocally in </v>

1960
01:35:55.551 --> 01:35:56.384
<v Speaker 2>longterm relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going to be a failure and you </v>

1961
01:35:58.401 --> 01:35:58.651
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1962
01:35:58.651 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1963
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.330
<v Speaker 2>in any corporation that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that produces anything of any value.</v>

1964
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean the production is one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be competent at the </v>

1965
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:05.744
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be in constant </v>

1966
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.473
<v Speaker 2>communication with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your buyers and foster those </v>

1967
01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:12.674
<v Speaker 2>relationships personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's intense competition and </v>

1968
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 2>if those personal relationships aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>of high quality,</v>

1969
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.673
<v Speaker 2>then your business fails and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I really learned because I spent </v>

1970
01:36:22.101 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time with business people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as academics,</v>

1971
01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:25.874
<v Speaker 2>is that business people do a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of socialization compared to </v>

1972
01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:29.504
<v Speaker 2>academics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Academics can judge each other's work </v>

1973
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:32.833
<v Speaker 2>more or less on the basis of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific merit and so they don't have </v>

1974
01:36:35.991 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 2>to establish personal relationships to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same degree,</v>

1975
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.060
<v Speaker 2>but business people are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering,</v>

1976
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I trust you?</v>

1977
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Can we enter into a reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that's going to be a mutual</v>

1978
01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:46.004
<v Speaker 2>benefit over the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're testing people out </v>

1979
01:36:47.991 --> 01:36:48.824
<v Speaker 2>socially all the time and if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of reciprocating honestly over </v>

1980
01:36:53.331 --> 01:36:54.164
<v Speaker 2>some decades say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to screw things up in </v>

1981
01:36:57.051 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 2>an absolutely horrible way.</v>

1982
01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:00.650
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why they like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use golf as a matter of.</v>

1983
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:01.461
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1984
01:37:01.461 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 2>That's as Dr is two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1985
01:37:03.471 --> 01:37:04.304
<v Speaker 2>you get to see how someone handles </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition and we get to see if they </v>

1986
01:37:06.051 --> 01:37:06.800
<v Speaker 2>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.670
<v Speaker 2>because people do cheat and golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1988
01:37:08.671 --> 01:37:10.610
<v Speaker 2>it was an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good friend of mine,</v>

1989
01:37:10.611 --> 01:37:11.444
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1990
01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:16.540
<v Speaker 2>his dad was playing golf with this man </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his wife was there as well,</v>

1991
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:18.463
<v Speaker 2>and the wife saw the dad moved the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw this man that he was playing golf </v>

1992
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move the ball and she said,</v>

1993
01:37:24.441 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 2>do not go into business with this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did not trust this man.</v>

1994
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 2>He's a cheater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cheated at golf and he thought it was</v>

1995
01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 2>not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1996
01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 2>it's just a game of golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1997
01:37:33.171 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big deal.</v>

1998
01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.050
<v Speaker 2>It turns out the guy was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal.</v>

1999
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Just took a while to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2000
01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:38.624
<v Speaker 2>he wound up doing a lot of other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that how you do some things is </v>

2001
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes how you do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2002
01:37:42.741 --> 01:37:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why people are so interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in games.</v>

2003
01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2004
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.190
<v Speaker 2>because gave who a person really is well</v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

2005
01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.433
<v Speaker 2>This is again why I'm such an admirer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget because he knew very well that </v>

2006
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>game is a microcosm</v>

2007
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we like being.</v>

2008
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to have an explanation for why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like games.</v>

2009
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this a lot in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures too,</v>

2010
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:04.404
<v Speaker 1>is you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2011
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you know any game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any competitive game,</v>

2012
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.593
<v Speaker 1>soccer's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a hunting game because </v>

2013
01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're firing a projectile at a target.</v>

2014
01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the targets,</v>

2015
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 1>the goal and the projectiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>

2016
01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:21.410
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter is that so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2017
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You have teams that are figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hunt properly.</v>

2018
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:26.543
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well to hunt properly you have to put </v>

2019
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:31.980
<v Speaker 1>the ball in the net as many times as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>

2020
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:36.270
<v Speaker 1>So and so you organize yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy to facilitate that,</v>

2021
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.373
<v Speaker 1>but then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the whole story because you </v>

2022
01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:43.560
<v Speaker 1>tell your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter whether you win or lose,</v>

2023
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play the game.</v>

2024
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And the kids all freaked out about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't know what you mean.</v>

2025
01:38:49.051 --> 01:38:49.591
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2026
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean doubt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to supposed to try to win.</v>

2027
01:38:51.451 --> 01:38:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I mean,</v>

2028
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still true.</v>

2029
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But here's what you mean is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a league,</v>

2030
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not trying to win the soccer </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

2031
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to win the soccer </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship and to win the championship</v>

2032
01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:06.234
<v Speaker 1>you have to win a whole bunch of games </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rules to win a whole bunch of </v>

2033
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:11.490
<v Speaker 1>games aren't the same as the rules to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win one game.</v>

2034
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could go flat out as the </v>

2035
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:14.304
<v Speaker 1>Premadonna and bend and bend the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cut corners and exhaust every one </v>

2036
01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:18.234
<v Speaker 1>and win the game and then lose the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>three because that's a stupid medium to </v>

2037
01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:21.654
<v Speaker 1>longterm strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could be like the superstar and </v>

2038
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 1>hog the ball at the time and never give </v>
<v Speaker 1>your teammates a chance to develop.</v>

2039
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 1>But then you're injured and you're team </v>
<v Speaker 1>is out.</v>

2040
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid strategy too.</v>

2041
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2042
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.013
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do to win the </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship is that you have to </v>

2043
01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:39.210
<v Speaker 1>organize your team so that the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>players lead,</v>

2044
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:40.223
<v Speaker 1>but that everybody gets developed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you play the medium to longterm </v>

2045
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.110
<v Speaker 1>game in a fair way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fair and decent way.</v>

2046
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

2047
01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:47.994
<v Speaker 1>well that's how you win a championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a coach a while back and he </v>

2048
01:39:50.371 --> 01:39:55.371
<v Speaker 1>said one of the things he did to select </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes was to watch what happened when</v>

2049
01:39:55.561 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 1>they scored a goal and if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrating on their own,</v>

2050
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sort of an egotistical way,</v>

2051
01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:06.090
<v Speaker 1>then that wasn't such a good sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they scored a goal or a touchdown</v>

2052
01:40:06.091 --> 01:40:06.924
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it was and their whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire team came in and bombed them and </v>

2053
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:09.714
<v Speaker 1>then like lifted them up on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and he thought that guy is an </v>

2054
01:40:12.091 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 1>athlete because not only can he put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

2055
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:17.183
<v Speaker 1>put the ball in the net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he does it in a way that benefits </v>

2056
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 1>the entire team and that's the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't around for the long run.</v>

2057
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And so then the goal isn't just to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball in the goal.</v>

2058
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:26.663
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to put the ball in the goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>the the largest number of times while </v>

2059
01:40:30.661 --> 01:40:34.680
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously benefiting as many as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your fellow players as you can.</v>

2060
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Although no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2061
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:36.833
<v Speaker 3>that's a great strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's necessarily the </v>

2062
01:40:38.041 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 3>meaning of it doesn't matter if you win </v>
<v Speaker 3>or lose,</v>

2063
01:40:40.141 --> 01:40:40.974
<v Speaker 3>it's how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what I don't think people think </v>

2064
01:40:43.111 --> 01:40:43.944
<v Speaker 3>of it in terms of like a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy for championship leagues will </v>

2065
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 3>take when they're saying it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter whether you win or lose,</v>

2066
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>it's how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning don't cheat.</v>

2067
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Do your</v>

2068
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 2>best and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2069
01:40:56.051 --> 01:41:00.310
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While learn how to handle failure,</v>

2070
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>learn how to handle victory will also </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from the experience itself.</v>

2071
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if you make a mistake and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying your hardest,</v>

2072
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 2>but you make an error because someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a counter to that.</v>

2073
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Then you learn from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you play the game.</v>

2074
01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.033
<v Speaker 2>You play it so stupidly and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think and you win just because you got </v>

2075
01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:21.214
<v Speaker 2>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not as good as playing </v>

2076
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:23.494
<v Speaker 2>intelligently and expanding your skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>and losing yes because the other people </v>

2077
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>are superior and then you learn from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that they figured out a way to have</v>

2078
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:32.930
<v Speaker 2>solutions to all the problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>presented this.</v>

2079
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:33.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2080
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:34.324
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing out is that while you're </v>

2081
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:36.664
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be expanding your range of </v>

2082
01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:40.720
<v Speaker 2>skills so that you get better at playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next game,</v>

2083
01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.793
<v Speaker 2>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well even the soccer championship isn't </v>

2084
01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.130
<v Speaker 2>the whole game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2085
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Because your life is a whole series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>

2086
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:48.123
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2087
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 2>of championships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different types of ideas.</v>

2088
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:53.920
<v Speaker 2>The championships will come if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to excel and get excellent.</v>

2089
01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also if people invite you to play.</v>

2090
01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:57.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's both of those are the two </v>

2091
01:41:59.591 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the goal,</v>

2092
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:02.463
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal isn't to put the ball in the </v>

2093
01:42:03.161 --> 01:42:03.994
<v Speaker 2>net,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal is to get excellent and to be </v>

2094
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:06.604
<v Speaker 2>invited to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mechanism is that you put the </v>

2095
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:09.814
<v Speaker 2>ball in the goal and that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that helps explain why people find </v>

2096
01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.253
<v Speaker 2>competitive sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unbelievably compelling because you </v>

2097
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.550
<v Speaker 2>can be cynical about it and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2098
01:42:18.551 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 2>there's 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people there watching,</v>

2099
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody kick a,</v>

2100
01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spheroid object into a net who the </v>

2101
01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:27.200
<v Speaker 2>hell cares like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2102
01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the issue.</v>

2103
01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:29.524
<v Speaker 2>What you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are in fact doing is you're </v>

2104
01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:31.834
<v Speaker 2>going there to watch people develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise and to learn to play </v>

2105
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:37.564
<v Speaker 2>reciprocally in a noble and ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner and all of that sport when it's </v>

2106
01:42:41.741 --> 01:42:42.574
<v Speaker 2>done properly is a direct physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarnation of that ethic and so it's </v>

2107
01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:48.844
<v Speaker 2>not surprising that that's why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get so excited when they see an athlete </v>

2108
01:42:51.731 --> 01:42:52.564
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>

2109
01:42:52.570 --> 01:42:53.403
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the best thing that you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a sports event is someone who does </v>

2110
01:42:56.861 --> 01:42:57.694
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm purely in the spirit of fair play </v>

2111
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:03.820
<v Speaker 2>and in a manner that's unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent,</v>

2112
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:05.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wayne Gretzky was very good at that,</v>

2113
01:43:06.490 --> 01:43:07.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he was an excellent,</v>

2114
01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 2>excellent sportsmen and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably skilled and so people loved</v>

2115
01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:13.210
<v Speaker 2>them and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect because he was,</v>

2116
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.073
<v Speaker 2>he was a player who played the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was more important to play it </v>

2117
01:43:17.201 --> 01:43:20.530
<v Speaker 2>properly then to win and he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of his game at the same time.</v>

2118
01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightened and cut corners.</v>

2119
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no cutting corners.</v>

2120
01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's very cool.</v>

2121
01:43:26.981 --> 01:43:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And you see a very high order ethic </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge out of that.</v>

2122
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:32.110
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the kind of player that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2123
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wrote about that in 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>for life when you know,</v>

2124
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.033
<v Speaker 2>because part of my advice in rule five </v>
<v Speaker 2>was not to let your kids do anything </v>

2125
01:43:38.351 --> 01:43:39.184
<v Speaker 2>that makes you dislike them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the idea there is </v>

2126
01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:43.084
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really on the side of your </v>

2127
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:45.814
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you help them develop in a manner that </v>

2128
01:43:47.351 --> 01:43:48.184
<v Speaker 2>makes them eminently desirable to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and capable of interacting </v>

2129
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>properly with adults</v>

2130
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 4>because then the whole world opens up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2131
01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:55.283
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a really and then you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that's cool about that too is </v>

2132
01:43:58.551 --> 01:44:02.510
<v Speaker 4>that this is what makes the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Marxists types so wrong,</v>

2133
01:44:02.511 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 4>is that your best strategy for success </v>
<v Speaker 4>in life isn't the exercise of power.</v>

2134
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:09.320
<v Speaker 4>It's a really counterproductive </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy.</v>

2135
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't even work very well for advanced</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

2136
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:14.630
<v Speaker 4>Your best strategy is skill and </v>
<v Speaker 4>reciprocity,</v>

2137
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 4>so when there's a real high order ethic </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that that has nothing to do,</v>

2138
01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:21.344
<v Speaker 4>so the idea that our hierarchies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on power and they're corrupt </v>

2139
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:24.674
<v Speaker 4>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the whole world is a battleground </v>

2140
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:30.910
<v Speaker 4>between hierarchies of different power </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies and it's winner take all and</v>

2141
01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 4>you know the devil take the hindmost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just completely inappropriate.</v>

2142
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.360
<v Speaker 4>Psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a real situation where you</v>

2143
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:41.623
<v Speaker 3>very rarely find people who excel at </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and who have benefited from </v>

2144
01:44:46.911 --> 01:44:48.920
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are against competition,</v>

2145
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:50.143
<v Speaker 3>and you very rarely find people who have</v>
<v Speaker 3>no skill in competition at all and who </v>

2146
01:44:55.281 --> 01:44:57.800
<v Speaker 3>have never engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have shied away from it their whole life</v>

2147
01:44:57.801 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 3>that support it and and believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an important part of our culture.</v>

2148
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I think people want,</v>

2149
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:09.320
<v Speaker 3>they want to believe and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support things that reinforce their idea</v>

2150
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:11.820
<v Speaker 3>of how they're living their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly and if,</v>

2151
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 3>if they shy away from competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it makes them nervous,</v>

2152
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 3>if they've never excelled at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't feel right to them,</v>

2153
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:20.690
<v Speaker 3>if it makes them uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to feel like there some better</v>

2154
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:23.600
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the things that leads</v>

2155
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:25.160
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive,</v>

2156
01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.593
<v Speaker 3>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate people towards socialism </v>

2157
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:29.203
<v Speaker 3>and this concept that capitalism and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and any form of competition at all </v>

2158
01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:33.523
<v Speaker 3>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately is going to lead to a few </v>

2159
01:45:35.541 --> 01:45:38.960
<v Speaker 3>people hogging up all the wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominating all the people.</v>

2160
01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing that's kind of sad about</v>

2161
01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:45.410
<v Speaker 4>that is that no matter what system you </v>
<v Speaker 4>set up that outcome,</v>

2162
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:46.743
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you look at the prieto </v>

2163
01:45:48.361 --> 01:45:51.240
<v Speaker 4>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if that's the distribution of wealth,</v>

2164
01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:55.440
<v Speaker 4>you'll find that in every society that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we know of,</v>

2165
01:45:55.441 --> 01:45:58.800
<v Speaker 4>whether it's capitalist or socialist or </v>
<v Speaker 4>communist for that matter,</v>

2166
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.903
<v Speaker 4>a small proportion of the people have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproportionate amount of the </v>

2167
01:46:03.241 --> 01:46:04.920
<v Speaker 4>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2168
01:46:05.190 --> 01:46:08.100
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the other thing that I've been trying</v>

2169
01:46:08.101 --> 01:46:08.934
<v Speaker 4>to explain in my lectures is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were really concerned about the </v>

2170
01:46:12.121 --> 01:46:12.954
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed and the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't put hierarchical </v>

2171
01:46:15.601 --> 01:46:16.434
<v Speaker 4>dispossession at the feet of capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's a way worse problem than </v>

2172
01:46:19.741 --> 01:46:20.574
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2173
01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.050
<v Speaker 4>because the Marxists types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think,</v>

2174
01:46:22.051 --> 01:46:23.670
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we didn't have capitalism,</v>

2175
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:26.460
<v Speaker 4>there wouldn't be hierarchies and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be dispossession.</v>

2176
01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.300
<v Speaker 4>And that's complete bloody rubbish </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the problem of hierarchy and the</v>

2177
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:33.330
<v Speaker 4>problem of dispossession is way deeper </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the problem of capitalism.</v>

2178
01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:37.290
<v Speaker 4>So like if you look at Neolithic grave </v>
<v Speaker 4>sites way before there was capitalism,</v>

2179
01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.860
<v Speaker 4>you see that a small number of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are buried with all the gold.</v>

2180
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:45.120
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact of,</v>

2181
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:50.150
<v Speaker 4>of dis dis unequal distribution of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's his oldest,</v>

2182
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:54.960
<v Speaker 4>that's as old as hierarchies are old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievably old.</v>

2183
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.213
<v Speaker 4>And so for the leftists to take an </v>
<v Speaker 4>anticapitalist position and assume that </v>

2184
01:46:59.401 --> 01:47:00.234
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be a benefit to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed is an idea that's at least </v>

2185
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 4>145 years out of date as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

2186
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:09.720
<v Speaker 4>But we do want to discourage tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do want to keep keep that.</v>

2187
01:47:09.721 --> 01:47:10.554
<v Speaker 4>We want to keep someone from </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulating so much wealth that they </v>

2188
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:14.243
<v Speaker 4>dominate the world and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproportionate effect on culture and </v>

2189
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:18.893
<v Speaker 4>do things that are detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be in fact detrimental for </v>

2190
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 4>decades and decades to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2191
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.653
<v Speaker 4>to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's where you have a balance of </v>

2192
01:47:25.561 --> 01:47:27.900
<v Speaker 4>powers in the United States because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:47:27.901 --> 01:47:32.901
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing is it's not the case like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you can't characterize the</v>

2194
01:47:34.411 --> 01:47:35.244
<v Speaker 4>West as a patriarchal tyranny doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean that hierarchies don't become </v>

2195
01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:38.964
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical.</v>

2196
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:39.923
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they do and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have to be alert to that and </v>

2197
01:47:43.051 --> 01:47:43.884
<v Speaker 4>that's been known for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is it fair to say that the West has </v>

2198
01:47:46.741 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 4>some aspects of a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchical tyranny?</v>

2199
01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

2200
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:52.663
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that's a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 4>true is so like the way that society is </v>

2201
01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:01.530
<v Speaker 4>represented in our deep narrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures is always twofold.</v>

2202
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:05.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a wise king in a tyrannical king</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're pitted against each other.</v>

2203
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.290
<v Speaker 4>And your job is to amplify the wise king</v>
<v Speaker 4>and keep the tyrant under control.</v>

2204
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the evil advisor to the king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2205
01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:14.850
<v Speaker 4>like scar in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2206
01:48:14.851 --> 01:48:15.684
<v Speaker 4>So there's always this shadowy figure in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the background that's malevolent and </v>

2207
01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:20.034
<v Speaker 4>psychopathic and power obsessed that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempting to take over the hierarchy </v>

2208
01:48:23.821 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by ill gotten means that and that that's</v>

2209
01:48:28.170 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 4>evil itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In some sense.</v>

2210
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.593
<v Speaker 4>It's the archetype of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that has to be taken into </v>

2211
01:48:33.121 --> 01:48:33.954
<v Speaker 4>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with the viewpoint </v>

2212
01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:38.970
<v Speaker 4>that's so prevalent in our society right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now is that nuts,</v>

2213
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:42.210
<v Speaker 4>the patriarchal tyranny viewpoint is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's only the evil king.</v>

2214
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:43.343
<v Speaker 4>And then that's particularly hard on </v>
<v Speaker 4>young men because if you believe that </v>

2215
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:50.040
<v Speaker 4>all of our hierarchies are predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but arbitrary power,</v>

2216
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:53.040
<v Speaker 4>and then that's a natural consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>masculinity.</v>

2217
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Then whenever you see anyone whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>masculine manifest,</v>

2218
01:48:56.161 --> 01:48:59.520
<v Speaker 4>anything that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence or confidence or,</v>

2219
01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:00.571
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2220
01:49:00.571 --> 01:49:03.970
<v Speaker 4>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or let's say competitiveness or,</v>

2221
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:05.580
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heaven forbid,</v>

2222
01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:06.414
<v Speaker 4>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you immediately assume that that's </v>

2223
01:49:07.921 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 4>nothing but a manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical power and that you discourage</v>

2224
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 4>it or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2225
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:13.943
<v Speaker 4>or you certainly failed to encourage it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's a dreadful </v>

2226
01:49:16.981 --> 01:49:19.980
<v Speaker 4>mistake because that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that masculine energy,</v>

2227
01:49:19.981 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 4>whether that's characteristic of women </v>
<v Speaker 4>or men,</v>

2228
01:49:22.441 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 4>because women can certainly manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2229
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:25.343
<v Speaker 4>that's something that should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated and celebrate it and the way </v>

2230
01:49:28.171 --> 01:49:29.004
<v Speaker 4>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's partly why mechanisms like </v>

2231
01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:35.640
<v Speaker 4>competitive sports are so necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you want to take kids,</v>

2232
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:40.110
<v Speaker 4>let's say boys are more competitive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive boys just for this example.</v>

2233
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.573
<v Speaker 4>You want to take them and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>socialize them intensely so that they </v>

2234
01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:45.564
<v Speaker 4>take that aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive impulse and they're capable </v>

2235
01:49:48.131 --> 01:49:48.964
<v Speaker 4>of manifesting it inside a social </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure like a game so that it's a </v>

2236
01:49:51.981 --> 01:49:55.200
<v Speaker 4>benefit to everyone and you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and did it.</v>

2237
01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2238
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:57.544
<v Speaker 4>you teach an aggressive kid that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneath his dignity to bully someone </v>

2239
01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 4>weaker so you can attach that right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the competitiveness.</v>

2240
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You bully someone weaker than you,</v>

2241
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:12.720
<v Speaker 4>you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pathetic slide.</v>

2242
01:50:12.930 --> 01:50:17.530
<v Speaker 4>It speaks right to that competitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive to want to be a loser.</v>

2243
01:50:17.710 --> 01:50:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Martial arts are so critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2244
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the major tenants of </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

2245
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.563
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a is a huge part of what's </v>

2246
01:50:25.211 --> 01:50:30.211
<v Speaker 3>taught in traditional martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>academies as there's a very clear way of</v>

2247
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:31.444
<v Speaker 3>behaving and you're never supposed to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything remotely like bullied and </v>

2248
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to have your power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2249
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.220
<v Speaker 3>And you're supposed to have extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverence for the people who taught.</v>

2250
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your master,</v>

2251
01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:47.950
<v Speaker 3>you literally call them a master in all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all martial arts,</v>

2252
01:50:47.951 --> 01:50:49.170
<v Speaker 3>they're referred to somebody.</v>

2253
01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's another thing that's really,</v>

2254
01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:54.990
<v Speaker 4>that's really interesting about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional hierarchy is like because the</v>

2255
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:55.833
<v Speaker 4>leftist critics look at a hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think every position is up looking </v>

2256
01:50:59.211 --> 01:51:00.720
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2257
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:01.783
<v Speaker 4>But what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're pointing out is knowing a </v>

2258
01:51:03.141 --> 01:51:07.700
<v Speaker 4>functional hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of respect going up.</v>

2259
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not only,</v>

2260
01:51:09.171 --> 01:51:11.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not just power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like its power,</v>

2261
01:51:11.121 --> 01:51:11.990
<v Speaker 4>its,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its,</v>

2262
01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.810
<v Speaker 4>its authority and subordination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

2263
01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.720
<v Speaker 4>voluntary subordination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you should be,</v>

2264
01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:22.400
<v Speaker 4>you should be properly subordinate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who are better at what you're</v>

2265
01:51:22.401 --> 01:51:23.510
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2266
01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:25.940
<v Speaker 4>And in a functional organization that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens naturally.</v>

2267
01:51:25.941 --> 01:51:26.774
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that happens too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the radical leftist never take this </v>

2268
01:51:29.391 --> 01:51:30.224
<v Speaker 4>into account as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that one of the things I've learned </v>

2269
01:51:32.481 --> 01:51:34.820
<v Speaker 4>about people who've run successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>

2270
01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:35.893
<v Speaker 4>whether they're academic or business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they really loved mentoring </v>

2271
01:51:40.851 --> 01:51:41.684
<v Speaker 4>young people.</v>

2272
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.673
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an intrinsic pleasure because you </v>

2273
01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:44.931
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

2274
01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:47.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's for the evil capitalist,</v>

2275
01:51:47.001 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2276
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:49.250
<v Speaker 4>it's winner take all and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2277
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.093
<v Speaker 4>and to hell with everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's an unbelievably cynical view </v>

2278
01:51:53.301 --> 01:51:55.970
<v Speaker 4>of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only really applies to people who are</v>

2279
01:51:55.971 --> 01:51:58.250
<v Speaker 4>genuinely psychopathic and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 4>rare.</v>

2280
01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.413
<v Speaker 4>And so most of the people I know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been hyper successful are </v>

2281
01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:03.764
<v Speaker 4>absolutely thrilled if they can find a </v>
<v Speaker 4>young person and they don't care </v>

2282
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:09.920
<v Speaker 4>generally speaking about sex or creed or</v>
<v Speaker 4>color or any of that crap.</v>

2283
01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:10.933
<v Speaker 4>They care about competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to find a competent young </v>

2284
01:52:13.161 --> 01:52:13.994
<v Speaker 4>person who's got a lot of possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then open up all sorts of doors of </v>

2285
01:52:17.631 --> 01:52:20.510
<v Speaker 4>opportunity for them and to see how they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can help them develop.</v>

2286
01:52:20.511 --> 01:52:22.460
<v Speaker 4>And if they can do that with 20 or 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2287
01:52:22.461 --> 01:52:26.660
<v Speaker 4>then like my graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my graduate supervisor had his,</v>

2288
01:52:26.661 --> 01:52:27.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2289
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.800
<v Speaker 4>he's getting old and he had his </v>
<v Speaker 4>retirement party about two years ago and</v>

2290
01:52:30.801 --> 01:52:31.634
<v Speaker 4>about 30 of the people that he trained </v>
<v Speaker 4>in to becoming scientists came to his </v>

2291
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:38.750
<v Speaker 4>party and they talked nonstop about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial effect that,</v>

2292
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:41.360
<v Speaker 4>that he had on their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2293
01:52:41.361 --> 01:52:43.070
<v Speaker 4>he found lot of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2294
01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:47.450
<v Speaker 4>they were young and smart but didn't all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that properly oriented in the world.</v>

2295
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:50.720
<v Speaker 4>And he picked them out and gave them </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities and he certainly did.</v>

2296
01:52:50.721 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 4>This for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has opened all sorts of doors for me.</v>

2297
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.460
<v Speaker 4>And that was a huge source of pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 4>in his life.</v>

2298
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.130
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe the primary source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a family as well,</v>

2299
01:52:58.131 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 4>and obviously his family was of primary </v>
<v Speaker 4>importance,</v>

2300
01:53:00.981 --> 01:53:05.981
<v Speaker 4>but in his professional career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't his name on papers in his,</v>

2301
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:07.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2302
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.220
<v Speaker 4>his name in the mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2303
01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 4>it was all these young people whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>careers he could foster.</v>

2304
01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 4>It's never ending source of </v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfaction.</v>

2305
01:53:13.810 --> 01:53:14.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a critical aspect of </v>

2306
01:53:15.671 --> 01:53:18.610
<v Speaker 3>being a successful person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to realize that a,</v>

2307
01:53:18.690 --> 01:53:19.523
<v Speaker 3>there's a great personal benefit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping other people and that you feel </v>

2308
01:53:22.961 --> 01:53:23.794
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not just like something that </v>

2309
01:53:24.791 --> 01:53:25.624
<v Speaker 3>looks good on paper you when you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>show some young person who's coming up </v>

2310
01:53:29.111 --> 01:53:31.990
<v Speaker 3>the way you're 10 years ahead of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can say,</v>

2311
01:53:31.991 --> 01:53:34.750
<v Speaker 3>these are the mistakes that I made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can help you get through this,</v>

2312
01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:35.733
<v Speaker 3>and then you see them flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great deal of personal </v>

2313
01:53:38.171 --> 01:53:39.004
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction infinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be some sort of an </v>

2314
01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.190
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary benefit to this.</v>

2315
01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2316
01:53:42.930 --> 01:53:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of.</v>

2317
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.903
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing is we are evolved for </v>

2318
01:53:47.011 --> 01:53:50.280
<v Speaker 4>reciprocity really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not evolved for power,</v>

2319
01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.213
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what so deeply wrong about the </v>

2320
01:53:52.951 --> 01:53:57.090
<v Speaker 4>damn postmodernists in the Marxist is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't what human first of all.</v>

2321
01:53:57.091 --> 01:54:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Power is not the best strategy to attain</v>
<v Speaker 4>success.</v>

2322
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:02.303
<v Speaker 4>It's simply not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even work for chimpanzees </v>

2323
01:54:03.871 --> 01:54:06.840
<v Speaker 4>because the more the brute chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2324
01:54:06.841 --> 01:54:09.630
<v Speaker 4>the ones that that rule purely as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of force,</v>

2325
01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:10.643
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they weaken to subordinates </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are reciprocally engaged so that </v>

2326
01:54:14.461 --> 01:54:16.470
<v Speaker 4>have a friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tear them into pieces,</v>

2327
01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:17.573
<v Speaker 4>so I don't care how strong you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three guys that are like two thirds of </v>

2328
01:54:20.141 --> 01:54:22.800
<v Speaker 4>your strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to take you out so,</v>

2329
01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:28.500
<v Speaker 4>so you're much better situated in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in society and in your life if you,</v>

2330
01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:29.873
<v Speaker 4>if you're in an interactive network of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reciprocally beneficial relationships </v>

2331
01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.213
<v Speaker 4>that works in Games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also works in life and to reduce </v>

2332
01:54:37.741 --> 01:54:39.640
<v Speaker 4>that and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're competent,</v>

2333
01:54:39.641 --> 01:54:42.000
<v Speaker 4>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the killer combination,</v>

2334
01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:42.953
<v Speaker 4>hyper competence and the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>genuine reciprocity that makes you </v>

2335
01:54:46.771 --> 01:54:47.560
<v Speaker 4>unstoppable.</v>

2336
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.393
<v Speaker 3>Why is there this lack of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>and appreciating this nuance in people </v>

2337
01:54:52.691 --> 01:54:57.691
<v Speaker 3>that oppose these ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is,</v>

2338
01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 3>what's the willingness to be ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 3>about all the variabilities,</v>

2339
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:06.530
<v Speaker 3>especially when you consider the bulk of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the research?</v>

2340
01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:07.453
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some of it's justification for </v>

2341
01:55:08.691 --> 01:55:10.220
<v Speaker 4>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2342
01:55:10.221 --> 01:55:11.054
<v Speaker 4>like if you're not doing very well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's really easy to think that the </v>

2343
01:55:13.191 --> 01:55:14.024
<v Speaker 4>game is rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also easy to be resentful about </v>

2344
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:18.950
<v Speaker 4>people who seem to have more than you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2345
01:55:18.951 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it very clearly.</v>

2346
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.333
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's another thing that I've been </v>

2347
01:55:23.361 --> 01:55:24.194
<v Speaker 4>trying to lecture to people about is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should be very careful about </v>

2348
01:55:26.841 --> 01:55:29.060
<v Speaker 4>assuming that someone else has more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

2349
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:30.313
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the best predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether someone has money is how old </v>

2350
01:55:33.411 --> 01:55:34.244
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So old people are Richard than young </v>

2351
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously right?</v>

2352
01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Because they had their whole life to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accrue wealth.</v>

2353
01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well who's got it better?</v>

2354
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 4>You want to be rich and older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young and poor,</v>

2355
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:52.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't buy youth with money so</v>

2356
01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.920
<v Speaker 4>it isn't obvious who's better off in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation like that.</v>

2357
01:55:55.921 --> 01:55:56.754
<v Speaker 4>It's in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most people who are old enrich </v>

2358
01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:01.380
<v Speaker 4>would trade it for young and poor fairly</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn quickly.</v>

2359
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why people really get angry </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they see young rich people.</v>

2360
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 4>I know that's just too much to bear a </v>
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>

2361
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:09.470
<v Speaker 4>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous</v>

2362
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's that fellow that the 17 year</v>

2363
01:56:13.671 --> 01:56:15.980
<v Speaker 3>old little pump about that</v>

2364
01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.740
<v Speaker 4>famous 17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2365
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:21.480
<v Speaker 4>the folks in high school 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing too though,</v>

2366
01:56:21.481 --> 01:56:22.291
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2367
01:56:22.291 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 4>even with people who have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of,</v>

2368
01:56:24.690 --> 01:56:27.720
<v Speaker 4>let's call it good fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2369
01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:29.243
<v Speaker 4>independent of their talent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to scratch beneath the </v>

2370
01:56:32.671 --> 01:56:36.060
<v Speaker 4>surface very far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even successful people's lives until you</v>

2371
01:56:36.061 --> 01:56:39.470
<v Speaker 4>find it pretty decent vein of tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2372
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.130
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2373
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 4>that jealousy of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2374
01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:43.973
<v Speaker 4>of the successful is also based on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really unit dimensional view of exactly </v>

2375
01:56:48.511 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 4>what constitutes success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2376
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:52.950
<v Speaker 4>you see the trappings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they might be,</v>

2377
01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:55.560
<v Speaker 4>let's say it's a yacht and more money </v>
<v Speaker 4>than you know,</v>

2378
01:56:55.561 --> 01:56:56.394
<v Speaker 4>what to do with and you assume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's going to put that person at </v>

2379
01:56:58.561 --> 01:56:59.394
<v Speaker 4>the pinnacle of a satisfying life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's no shortage of dreadfully </v>

2380
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:03.534
<v Speaker 4>unhappy and addicted celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't obvious always that more </v>

2381
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:09.670
<v Speaker 4>money is good for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2382
01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2383
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem I'd like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2384
01:57:12.001 --> 01:57:12.834
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

2385
01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.673
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are worse problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but celebrity and fame and fortune are </v>

2386
01:57:17.521 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 4>also not that easy to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they come with their own pitfalls.</v>

2387
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:21.743
<v Speaker 4>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of things they don't </v>

2388
01:57:22.681 --> 01:57:24.600
<v Speaker 4>protect you against,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2389
01:57:24.601 --> 01:57:25.434
<v Speaker 4>people still get divorced and they still</v>
<v Speaker 4>get sick and they still die and their </v>

2390
01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:29.820
<v Speaker 4>parents still get Alzheimer's and all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2391
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:30.683
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fundamental tragic elements of life </v>

2392
01:57:32.491 --> 01:57:33.540
<v Speaker 4>are still in place.</v>

2393
01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:34.963
<v Speaker 3>One of the interesting things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are jealous of other people </v>

2394
01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:37.424
<v Speaker 3>that are extremely successful is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are missing one of the core lessons </v>

2395
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:41.743
<v Speaker 3>of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the core lessons of competition </v>

2396
01:57:44.751 --> 01:57:45.584
<v Speaker 3>is to be inspired by those who are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and not to try to chip them </v>

2397
01:57:48.141 --> 01:57:53.141
<v Speaker 3>down and take away their accomplishments</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't make you feel good.</v>

2398
01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are pis,</v>

2399
01:57:54.651 --> 01:57:55.484
<v Speaker 3>port competition are always the ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to diminish the </v>

2400
01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:00.200
<v Speaker 3>accomplishments of those who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely successful.</v>

2401
01:58:00.590 --> 01:58:01.423
<v Speaker 3>You see this in sports fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you see a loser fat sports fan </v>

2402
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:06.583
<v Speaker 3>talking about what a piece of Shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James is because he dropped the </v>

2403
01:58:09.741 --> 01:58:10.574
<v Speaker 3>ball or I missed a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this the extreme reaction that they </v>

2404
01:58:14.841 --> 01:58:15.674
<v Speaker 3>could have to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily successful is almost </v>

2405
01:58:19.191 --> 01:58:23.600
<v Speaker 3>always in direct proportion to how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a failure they are in their own life,</v>

2406
01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.930
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons why in </v>
<v Speaker 3>contrast it looks so ridiculous.</v>

2407
01:58:27.090 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's part of the danger.</v>

2408
01:58:28.411 --> 01:58:32.460
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's part of the danger of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire identity politics movement is</v>

2409
01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:33.294
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that that reasonable care for the </v>

2410
01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:38.160
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we already talked about,</v>

2411
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 4>is easily contaminated by hatred and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment for people are not only</v>

2412
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:42.873
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who are the most annoying person </v>

2413
01:58:45.221 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>who's successful is the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserves it.</v>

2414
01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:48.244
<v Speaker 2>Not the person who doesn't deserve it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can write the person who </v>

2415
01:58:50.471 --> 01:58:52.420
<v Speaker 2>doesn't deserve it off the lottery </v>
<v Speaker 2>winner.</v>

2416
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.561
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2417
01:58:53.561 --> 01:58:53.951
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2418
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:55.240
<v Speaker 2>he just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2419
01:58:55.241 --> 01:58:57.520
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you see the person who's broken</v>

2420
01:58:57.521 --> 01:58:58.354
<v Speaker 2>themselves in half and you know come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a really pathological background and </v>

2421
01:59:01.311 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 2>has been successful and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2422
01:59:03.341 --> 01:59:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you're uselessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wasting your life away.</v>

2423
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.073
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of person that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't like because they cast you </v>

2424
01:59:10.361 --> 01:59:11.194
<v Speaker 2>in a very dim light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is where competition is so </v>

2425
01:59:13.001 --> 01:59:13.834
<v Speaker 2>important because the person that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>background and competition has been </v>

2426
01:59:16.301 --> 01:59:20.800
<v Speaker 2>involved in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees a person who's busted their ass and</v>

2427
01:59:20.801 --> 01:59:21.634
<v Speaker 2>and become something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary and it's incredibly </v>

2428
01:59:24.821 --> 01:59:25.654
<v Speaker 2>inspirational and you look to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you want to read their </v>

2429
01:59:28.451 --> 01:59:29.284
<v Speaker 2>biographies and you want to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries on them because it </v>

2430
01:59:31.361 --> 01:59:32.560
<v Speaker 2>literally gives you fuel.</v>

2431
01:59:32.890 --> 01:59:33.723
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the person who shies away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is afraid of their own </v>

2432
01:59:36.941 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 2>insecurities and failures and really has</v>
<v Speaker 2>never tested themselves.</v>

2433
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:41.223
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones that find these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people extremely distasteful because </v>

2434
01:59:44.141 --> 01:59:48.160
<v Speaker 2>when they put themselves in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these incredible people,</v>

2435
01:59:48.161 --> 01:59:49.500
<v Speaker 2>they they come up short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2436
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Every ideal experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every ideal is a judge.</v>

2437
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's,</v>

2438
01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 2>what's the answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No ideals.</v>

2439
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid suggestion.</v>

2440
01:59:58.511 --> 01:59:59.344
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly doesn't because then it </v>

2441
01:59:59.981 --> 02:00:01.840
<v Speaker 2>leaves people without any meaning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>

2442
02:00:02.250 --> 02:00:03.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so well,</v>

2443
02:00:03.521 --> 02:00:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it speaks to what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier,</v>

2444
02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that we needed diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we needed adversity,</v>

2445
02:00:07.781 --> 02:00:09.220
<v Speaker 2>we need difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need struggle.</v>

2446
02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:10.870
<v Speaker 2>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a weight to carry,</v>

2447
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't have any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do not get your character tested.</v>

2448
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:15.643
<v Speaker 2>You do not advance in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception of who you are in this world </v>

2449
02:00:19.391 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you engage with all the other people</v>

2450
02:00:21.821 --> 02:00:22.260
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

2451
02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:26.380
<v Speaker 2>You don't call out what's best in you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can't live without that.</v>

2452
02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need that.</v>

2453
02:00:28.001 --> 02:00:31.180
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the trick seems to be that voluntary</v>

2454
02:00:31.181 --> 02:00:32.710
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of the adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2455
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:33.544
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>core to the mythos of Christianity </v>

2456
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>because there's an idea that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up your cross and stumble up hill.</v>

2457
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what that means is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2458
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you set your,</v>

2459
02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you set your eyes on some high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>

2460
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>the city of God on the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that happens to be,</v>

2461
02:00:50.381 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you take the burden,</v>

2462
02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:55.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever burden you're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting,</v>

2463
02:00:55.391 --> 02:00:58.510
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously going to be a burden </v>
<v Speaker 2>of suffering at least to some degree.</v>

2464
02:00:58.511 --> 02:01:01.230
<v Speaker 2>And you carry that voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the trick is that.</v>

2465
02:01:01.530 --> 02:01:02.351
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2466
02:01:02.351 --> 02:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>you need a purpose in your life.</v>

2467
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.271
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2468
02:01:04.271 --> 02:01:06.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of problems around you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2469
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 2>You have some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some problems even that bother you.</v>

2470
02:01:09.581 --> 02:01:10.391
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

2471
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:12.250
<v Speaker 2>they seem to call out to you those </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

2472
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those are your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the problems you should solve.</v>

2473
02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 2>And those I think are the call to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

2474
02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bugs me.</v>

2475
02:01:19.751 --> 02:01:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something about that is your problem.</v>

2476
02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:25.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerate.</v>

2477
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like weight training.</v>

2478
02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes detrimental.</v>

2479
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Where you've overtrained your body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down.</v>

2480
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:33.034
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount of problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have in your life that are </v>

2481
02:01:34.751 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 2>extremely beneficial because through </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through these problems,</v>

2482
02:01:39.441 --> 02:01:40.274
<v Speaker 2>sorting them out,</v>

2483
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you build your spirit,</v>

2484
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:42.824
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you build your character and if you </v>

2485
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:47.660
<v Speaker 3>don't accomplish anything and you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter any problems,</v>

2486
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:48.703
<v Speaker 3>you are this gelatinous soft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atrophied soul and you don't have the </v>

2487
02:01:53.451 --> 02:01:55.930
<v Speaker 3>intestinal fortitude or the spirit or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2488
02:01:56.050 --> 02:01:56.883
<v Speaker 3>The human potential has not been </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed to the point where you can </v>

2489
02:01:59.601 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 3>overcome adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way to overcome adversities,</v>

2490
02:02:02.211 --> 02:02:03.080
<v Speaker 3>to face it so</v>

2491
02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.840
<v Speaker 4>that that optimism that you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2492
02:02:05.841 --> 02:02:10.090
<v Speaker 4>So I've really been interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurophysiology of the.</v>

2493
02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:13.960
<v Speaker 4>Of the sense of meaning because </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurophysiology.</v>

2494
02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the meat,</v>

2495
02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:17.930
<v Speaker 4>meaning the feeling of meaning is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct.</v>

2496
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:19.123
<v Speaker 4>It's not a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a secondary consequence of </v>

2497
02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:23.780
<v Speaker 4>rational processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way deeper than that.</v>

2498
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:26.000
<v Speaker 4>It's something that drives rationality </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

2499
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:28.490
<v Speaker 4>So now you were just very amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2500
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:29.324
<v Speaker 4>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it varies in this way as far as I </v>

2501
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:32.240
<v Speaker 4>can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>

2502
02:02:32.241 --> 02:02:36.290
<v Speaker 4>So imagine as you said that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimal load,</v>

2503
02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:37.393
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You exceed that and to your detriment </v>

2504
02:02:39.210 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 4>and you see that in the weight room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pull a muscle,</v>

2505
02:02:41.301 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 4>you hurt your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll hurt yourself.</v>

2506
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.600
<v Speaker 4>You can injure yourself very badly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2507
02:02:44.601 --> 02:02:47.480
<v Speaker 4>You can take yourself out for the count </v>
<v Speaker 4>button.</v>

2508
02:02:47.481 --> 02:02:48.314
<v Speaker 4>Then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you work too little while then there </v>

2509
02:02:49.751 --> 02:02:50.810
<v Speaker 4>is no gain in it.</v>

2510
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:56.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to find that thin edge where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're competent in what you're doing,</v>

2511
02:02:56.871 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 4>but you're pushing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be where meaning lies.</v>

2512
02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:01.483
<v Speaker 4>That's what meaning tells people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says you're on the edge where you're </v>

2513
02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:05.533
<v Speaker 4>competent and and out of undue danger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but pushing yourself enough so that </v>

2514
02:03:10.491 --> 02:03:11.324
<v Speaker 4>you're continually developing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the instinct of meaning and that </v>

2515
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:14.594
<v Speaker 4>looks to me like it's a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the interaction between the right and </v>

2516
02:03:16.771 --> 02:03:17.604
<v Speaker 4>the left hemispheres and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of the interaction between </v>

2517
02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 4>the negative emotion systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and pain that regulate you,</v>

2518
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 4>that protect you from harm and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exploratory in place.</v>

2519
02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Systems that drive you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want the exploratory in place,</v>

2520
02:03:30.921 --> 02:03:31.754
<v Speaker 4>systems to drive you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they're regulated by these </v>

2521
02:03:34.431 --> 02:03:36.200
<v Speaker 4>negative emotions so you don't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

2522
02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:39.080
<v Speaker 4>and if you get that optimally right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's the maximal.</v>

2523
02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.093
<v Speaker 4>That's the point of maximal challenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that makes you really alert because </v>

2524
02:03:42.641 --> 02:03:44.270
<v Speaker 4>your positive emotion is functioning.</v>

2525
02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:45.253
<v Speaker 4>That's what's driving you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is worth doing and your negative </v>

2526
02:03:48.111 --> 02:03:49.730
<v Speaker 4>emotions are alert to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2527
02:03:49.731 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 4>but be awake and be careful and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that's like in the weight room.</v>

2528
02:03:53.241 --> 02:03:54.074
<v Speaker 4>If you're lifting something that's at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the edge of your ability and you've got </v>

2529
02:03:56.511 --> 02:03:59.480
<v Speaker 4>a spotter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want a push and you can barely do it</v>

2530
02:03:59.481 --> 02:04:02.720
<v Speaker 4>and you want to make sure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to like pull your arm down and</v>

2531
02:04:02.721 --> 02:04:04.990
<v Speaker 4>rip the hell out of your muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you.</v>

2532
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.690
<v Speaker 4>You're right on that edge and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the place of maximal gain and that sense</v>

2533
02:04:08.691 --> 02:04:09.524
<v Speaker 4>of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what puts you on the border </v>

2534
02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:12.500
<v Speaker 4>between chaos and order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2535
02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:13.334
<v Speaker 4>Because too much order means you're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>practicing what you already know and </v>

2536
02:04:16.311 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 4>then you then you stultify and stagnate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and too much chaos means you better look</v>

2537
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:22.430
<v Speaker 4>out because you're going to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2538
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:24.080
<v Speaker 4>You're pushing yourself beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 4>limits.</v>

2539
02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 4>You stay right on that edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where there's maximum meaning and</v>

2540
02:04:28.290 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 4>you're wired for that edges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Push it to push it.</v>

2541
02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2542
02:04:32.391 --> 02:04:34.100
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I recommend to young </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2543
02:04:34.110 --> 02:04:36.200
<v Speaker 4>especially true for people in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties,</v>

2544
02:04:36.201 --> 02:04:37.034
<v Speaker 4>is that you should push yourself beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>your limits of tolerance in your </v>

2545
02:04:40.171 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 4>twenties to find out where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much can you work,</v>

2546
02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 4>how disciplined can you become?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2547
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 4>can you work 12 hours a day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you work eight hours a day?</v>

2548
02:04:48.121 --> 02:04:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Can you work three hours a day like flat</v>
<v Speaker 4>out where's your limit and how much,</v>

2549
02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:56.220
<v Speaker 4>how much work can you do and how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>socialization you should find out.</v>

2550
02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.473
<v Speaker 4>Push yourself past and then back off to </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that point where it's optimally </v>

2551
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 4>sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what a lot of people do,</v>

2552
02:05:02.311 --> 02:05:03.031
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2553
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 4>they party too much when they're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their twenties.</v>

2554
02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:06.100
<v Speaker 4>They make a lot of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2555
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:06.983
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what they're doing and I would say </v>

2556
02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:09.840
<v Speaker 4>in sort of a haphazard way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2557
02:05:09.841 --> 02:05:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Because there's that instinct to go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and do more,</v>

2558
02:05:13.330 --> 02:05:14.163
<v Speaker 4>but it's unregulated and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not as self conscious as it might </v>

2559
02:05:18.061 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good to know that there's,</v>

2560
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:23.520
<v Speaker 4>it's good to think about that as a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're trying to discover what</v>

2561
02:05:23.521 --> 02:05:26.310
<v Speaker 4>your limitations are when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in your twenties so that you</v>

2562
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:30.180
<v Speaker 4>can hit that edge so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustain yourself across the decades.</v>

2563
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:31.700
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't,</v>

2564
02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to have too much fun,</v>

2565
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:35.663
<v Speaker 4>too much fun takes you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be the oldest guy at </v>

2566
02:05:37.831 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 4>the disco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2567
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:40.103
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not fun being the 40 year old at </v>

2568
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:42.324
<v Speaker 4>the singles bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Precisely so you want to make sure that </v>

2569
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:46.314
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is age appropriate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to push yourself in every </v>

2570
02:05:48.421 --> 02:05:49.254
<v Speaker 4>direction that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't be doing that with an </v>

2571
02:05:50.421 --> 02:05:51.080
<v Speaker 4>aim in mind.</v>

2572
02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:51.913
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're trying to make yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>into a better and more competent person </v>

2573
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 4>and so some discipline along with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fund is a good idea,</v>

2574
02:05:58.110 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 4>so to take care of yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people around you.</v>

2575
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:01.284
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things I recommended </v>
<v Speaker 4>to people and I've had quite a few </v>

2576
02:06:04.381 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 4>people actually tell me that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>done this.</v>

2577
02:06:06.781 --> 02:06:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2578
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:08.784
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing you could aim at if you had </v>

2579
02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:10.434
<v Speaker 4>any sense when you were young is to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most worth you could be the most </v>

2580
02:06:13.921 --> 02:06:15.840
<v Speaker 4>reliable person at your father's </v>
<v Speaker 4>funeral.</v>

2581
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:18.503
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that's a good challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had a bunch of people come up to </v>

2582
02:06:20.551 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 4>me in this last tour and tell me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what they did.</v>

2583
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:24.300
<v Speaker 4>These were often young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2584
02:06:24.301 --> 02:06:28.680
<v Speaker 4>like before 20 said my dad died suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 4>or died after years,</v>

2585
02:06:28.710 --> 02:06:31.260
<v Speaker 4>illness and it was just taken me out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>no wonder,</v>

2586
02:06:31.261 --> 02:06:32.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2587
02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to your lectures.</v>

2588
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:34.703
<v Speaker 4>You said you want to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>reliable person at the funeral because </v>

2589
02:06:36.811 --> 02:06:39.410
<v Speaker 4>everyone else is grieving and what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell else are you going to do?</v>

2590
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 4>He said that's what they tried to do and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not gotten through it,</v>

2591
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:43.223
<v Speaker 4>so now that's part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Picking up that load as far as I'm </v>

2592
02:06:46.381 --> 02:06:47.214
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a little self respect out of </v>

2593
02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 4>that two and a real sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2594
02:06:50.131 --> 02:06:50.964
<v Speaker 4>Because you know you're this sort of sad</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering creature that's capable of a </v>

2595
02:06:54.091 --> 02:06:58.320
<v Speaker 4>fair bit of malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you find out that you can carry a</v>

2596
02:06:58.321 --> 02:06:59.154
<v Speaker 4>heavy load and take care of yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a little leftover for some other </v>

2597
02:07:01.891 --> 02:07:02.724
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can wake up at three in the </v>

2598
02:07:03.631 --> 02:07:04.770
<v Speaker 4>morning and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well man,</v>

2599
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I could be worse</v>

2600
02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:06.713
<v Speaker 3>and this is not a political perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a positive constructive way of </v>

2601
02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:10.974
<v Speaker 3>looking at how to navigate the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you break down the sort of </v>

2602
02:07:16.831 --> 02:07:17.664
<v Speaker 3>behavior types,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the people that generally </v>

2603
02:07:19.801 --> 02:07:20.634
<v Speaker 3>support socialism or socialist ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 3>their anti-competition versus people </v>

2604
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:29.940
<v Speaker 3>that are pro pushing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fall into these right wing,</v>

2605
02:07:29.941 --> 02:07:34.941
<v Speaker 3>left wing sort of paradigms and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird way that especially there.</v>

2606
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that's especially</v>

2607
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.083
<v Speaker 2>true on the radical ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think you get that on the radical </v>

2608
02:07:38.981 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 2>right too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you should have people who are,</v>

2609
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>who are collectivists in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental orientation,</v>

2610
02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:44.494
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

2611
02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.353
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to take undue credit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>who their racial ancestors were or </v>

2612
02:07:49.230 --> 02:07:50.063
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2613
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.033
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say with the political </v>

2614
02:07:52.841 --> 02:07:56.020
<v Speaker 2>issue is that I think that you can build</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent,</v>

2615
02:07:56.021 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 2>responsible people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>

2616
02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.600
<v Speaker 2>right of the spectrum and the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

2617
02:08:01.601 --> 02:08:02.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that you can have left </v>

2618
02:08:03.971 --> 02:08:04.804
<v Speaker 2>wing political beliefs that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely aimed at aid to the </v>

2619
02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:09.394
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed without being resentful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchies and without </v>

2620
02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:15.430
<v Speaker 2>contaminating it with jealousy for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

2621
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2622
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I worked for the NDP when I</v>

2623
02:08:20.321 --> 02:08:21.154
<v Speaker 2>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>

2624
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 2>That was the Socialist Party in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The leaders,</v>

2625
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 2>some of the leaders were people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2626
02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:29.410
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of the low level party </v>
<v Speaker 2>functionary types.</v>

2627
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 2>They were the activist types that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>still see today.</v>

2628
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:33.580
<v Speaker 2>And there are mostly resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like them at all,</v>

2629
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:38.200
<v Speaker 2>but some of the leaders were genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine advocates for the working class,</v>

2630
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2631
02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>they had their flaws obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2632
02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:42.813
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put their money where their mouth </v>

2633
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:45.184
<v Speaker 2>was and they were trying to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchies we're open to </v>

2634
02:08:48.341 --> 02:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>advancement for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2635
02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>for let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common person,</v>

2636
02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:52.114
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who stopped up at the bottom </v>

2637
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 2>or for their children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might even be more important,</v>

2638
02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:56.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the hierarchy's remain open to </v>

2639
02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:00.183
<v Speaker 2>genuine competency based on competence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be a perfectly reasonable </v>

2640
02:09:04.061 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 2>thing for the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who insist on right is that,</v>

2641
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.133
<v Speaker 2>let's bloody well make sure that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair game and so that people don't get </v>

2642
02:09:10.631 --> 02:09:14.470
<v Speaker 2>locked out of movement forward because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of arbitrary positions of power.</v>

2643
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:15.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2644
02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:16.653
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable part of the </v>

2645
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:21.670
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you build better people,</v>

2646
02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:22.504
<v Speaker 2>you can build better people on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the right and people that be </v>

2647
02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:25.403
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that rules to the game or </v>

2648
02:09:26.861 --> 02:09:27.694
<v Speaker 2>better for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're better for the people that when </v>

2649
02:09:29.021 --> 02:09:30.430
<v Speaker 2>they're better for the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up,</v>

2650
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:31.473
<v Speaker 2>they're better for us if that's a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure in real rules and that you're </v>

2651
02:09:35.321 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 2>better off being a guy like Wayne </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gretzky.</v>

2652
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better off being a guy who's respected,</v>

2653
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:40.314
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays the game correctly and just does </v>

2654
02:09:41.561 --> 02:09:42.394
<v Speaker 2>his best and really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly become the champion and loved by </v>

2655
02:09:43.901 --> 02:09:45.820
<v Speaker 2>all because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're better off in every way.</v>

2656
02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the most state.</v>

2657
02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:48.700
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's so cool about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2658
02:09:48.701 --> 02:09:51.540
<v Speaker 2>So imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the antidote tomorrow.</v>

2659
02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2660
02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there are real problems and,</v>

2661
02:09:57.950 --> 02:10:02.440
<v Speaker 2>and hierarchical organizations can offer</v>
<v Speaker 2>real solutions socially and personally,</v>

2662
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:05.560
<v Speaker 2>so you can confront the problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>courageously and you can solve.</v>

2663
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So that's real and ameliorate suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>and limits malevolence.</v>

2664
02:10:09.431 --> 02:10:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And so there's nothing morally relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

2665
02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:14.650
<v Speaker 2>The second is that sense of meaning that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discussed.</v>

2666
02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.060
<v Speaker 2>That's not some philosophical second </v>
<v Speaker 2>order consequences of thinking.</v>

2667
02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:20.043
<v Speaker 2>It's way deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sense of meaning tells you when </v>

2668
02:10:23.321 --> 02:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>you're the God ski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russian psychologist called that the</v>

2669
02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.184
<v Speaker 2>zone of proximal development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I believe is where the phrase the </v>

2670
02:10:29.411 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 2>zone came from and so in the zone of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proximal development,</v>

2671
02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what adults do</v>

2672
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 4>with children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little kids that are learning to talk.</v>

2673
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:37.393
<v Speaker 4>Adults automatically talk to little </v>
<v Speaker 4>children who are learning to talk at a </v>

2674
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:43.460
<v Speaker 4>level that slightly exceeds their </v>
<v Speaker 4>current vocabulary.</v>

2675
02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.240
<v Speaker 4>They do that without even knowing it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that puts those kids in the zone,</v>

2676
02:10:47.241 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you just talk baby,</v>

2677
02:10:48.501 --> 02:10:49.334
<v Speaker 4>talk to kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all they learned is baby talk and </v>

2678
02:10:50.901 --> 02:10:54.200
<v Speaker 4>if you just talk like an adult and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't understand a word you're saying,</v>

2679
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 4>so you'll find this happy medium in </v>
<v Speaker 4>between where the kid mostly understands</v>

2680
02:10:58.941 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pulling them forward so that puts</v>

2681
02:11:02.121 --> 02:11:02.954
<v Speaker 4>them in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a meaningful zone and so you </v>

2682
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:08.600
<v Speaker 4>can feel the operation of that zone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own life.</v>

2683
02:11:08.601 --> 02:11:10.820
<v Speaker 4>That's what the Taoists are on a boat </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they say,</v>

2684
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:12.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dow is the way.</v>

2685
02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the pathway between chaos and</v>

2686
02:11:14.151 --> 02:11:14.600
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>

2687
02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.433
<v Speaker 4>That's meaning and you can feel that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life when you're deeply engaged in </v>

2688
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.110
<v Speaker 4>something like we have deeply engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations,</v>

2689
02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is part of the reason that we keep</v>

2690
02:11:23.391 --> 02:11:24.224
<v Speaker 4>having them and I think why they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>popular and we're not paying attention </v>

2691
02:11:26.601 --> 02:11:27.434
<v Speaker 4>to how the clock is ticking or how time </v>
<v Speaker 4>is flowing or even to the fact that </v>

2692
02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:30.793
<v Speaker 4>we're doing what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just having a conversation and </v>

2693
02:11:32.781 --> 02:11:34.400
<v Speaker 4>it's meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's engaged,</v>

2694
02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:36.590
<v Speaker 4>it keeps our eyes focused and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>senses.</v>

2695
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:37.783
<v Speaker 4>I'm concentrated on what's happening and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason for that is that there's </v>

2696
02:11:41.691 --> 02:11:45.590
<v Speaker 4>enough information flowing between us so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're being slightly transformed as</v>

2697
02:11:45.591 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 4>a consequence of the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2698
02:11:47.631 --> 02:11:50.540
<v Speaker 4>So we're both comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We trust each other.</v>

2699
02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.530
<v Speaker 4>We trust that the conversation is aimed </v>
<v Speaker 4>at something that's a mutual benefit.</v>

2700
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:55.783
<v Speaker 4>We trust each other to tell the truth to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the to the degree that we're capable of </v>

2701
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:00.344
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>

2702
02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.273
<v Speaker 4>And then when you engage in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange of information and to the </v>

2703
02:12:03.741 --> 02:12:04.574
<v Speaker 4>degree that it's breaking you down a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit and building you up in a </v>

2704
02:12:07.761 --> 02:12:10.460
<v Speaker 4>different way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a little death and rebirth.</v>

2705
02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:13.820
<v Speaker 4>There's constant little deaths and </v>
<v Speaker 4>rebirths in a meaningful conversation.</v>

2706
02:12:14.090 --> 02:12:14.923
<v Speaker 4>Then that keeps you alive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>functioning and that that focus is like </v>

2707
02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:20.093
<v Speaker 4>that that speaks to you so deeply that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that focus happens without any </v>

2708
02:12:23.211 --> 02:12:27.260
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and that's meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's that line between chaos and order</v>

2709
02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.090
<v Speaker 4>and that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That has nothing.</v>

2710
02:12:29.091 --> 02:12:29.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2711
02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would say,</v>

2712
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 4>here's another thing that's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that line between chaos and order,</v>

2713
02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 4>that's the same thing that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're playing a game property,</v>

2714
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're in the game and you're.</v>

2715
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You're exercising your skill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're pushing it,</v>

2716
02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:45.313
<v Speaker 4>but you're pushing it in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>also a benefit to your teammates and to </v>

2717
02:12:47.661 --> 02:12:51.500
<v Speaker 4>the progression of the game as such and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to being a better general player.</v>

2718
02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:52.333
<v Speaker 4>You're doing all that at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're evolved with enough natural </v>

2719
02:12:56.901 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 4>intelligence so that the sum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>total output of your nervous system says</v>

2720
02:13:01.761 --> 02:13:02.594
<v Speaker 4>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the right place at the right </v>

2721
02:13:03.891 --> 02:13:04.724
<v Speaker 4>time doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what makes your life </v>

2722
02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:08.150
<v Speaker 4>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's real.</v>

2723
02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.310
<v Speaker 4>I then I think it's more real than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else.</v>

2724
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:11.383
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more real than suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more real than malevolence </v>

2725
02:13:13.881 --> 02:13:17.720
<v Speaker 4>because it's the antidote to both of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those and so the whole moral,</v>

2726
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:20.770
<v Speaker 4>moral relativism issue for me is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonstarter.</v>

2727
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.900
<v Speaker 4>It's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of ways of interpreting the</v>

2728
02:13:23.901 --> 02:13:24.734
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there aren't very many ways of </v>

2729
02:13:25.461 --> 02:13:29.330
<v Speaker 4>interpreting it optimally and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel when you're doing that,</v>

2730
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 4>it makes you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then people that come to me</v>

2731
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:33.300
<v Speaker 1>after my talks and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2732
02:13:33.301 --> 02:13:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be putting my life together.</v>

2733
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I've developed a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to be more responsible.</v>

2734
02:13:37.951 --> 02:13:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to be more honest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put my relationships together.</v>

2735
02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:41.573
<v Speaker 1>They're all sparkly eyes because of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or crying sometimes because it's really </v>

2736
02:13:44.671 --> 02:13:47.700
<v Speaker 1>had an impact on them at a deep level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

2737
02:13:47.701 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actually works.</v>

2738
02:13:49.111 --> 02:13:49.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2739
02:13:49.711 --> 02:13:51.240
<v Speaker 1>it actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

2740
02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:52.283
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say as well that that's </v>

2741
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>associated with the idea of the deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>western idea of the logos,</v>

2742
02:13:57.751 --> 02:14:01.280
<v Speaker 1>which is meaning in action and speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2743
02:14:01.290 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 1>if we have a conversation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

2744
02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>then that's a manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of the logos and that's the thing</v>

2745
02:14:08.251 --> 02:14:10.070
<v Speaker 1>that destroys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2746
02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.093
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recreates at the same time because </v>

2747
02:14:14.461 --> 02:14:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy something,</v>

2748
02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.093
<v Speaker 1>destroys a little presupposition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had that was erroneous and replaces </v>

2749
02:14:19.861 --> 02:14:20.694
<v Speaker 1>it with something that's healthier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you have a meaningful </v>

2750
02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 1>conversation that happens.</v>

2751
02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little tweak now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't quite right here.</v>

2752
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Kick that moves and something new takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>its place.</v>

2753
02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:30.383
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little death and rebirth </v>

2754
02:14:31.291 --> 02:14:32.124
<v Speaker 1>instead of the catastrophic death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth that you might have to have if </v>

2755
02:14:35.251 --> 02:14:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you weren't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all tied together.</v>

2756
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It's all tied together with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon of meaning.</v>

2757
02:14:40.801 --> 02:14:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same as the adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

2758
02:14:43.410 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 1>That all ties together so nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other concept of meaning,</v>

2759
02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 1>like what is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's so,</v>

2760
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:51.163
<v Speaker 1>it's so huge to people but so fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to like what is </v>

2761
02:14:54.631 --> 02:14:55.201
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2762
02:14:55.201 --> 02:14:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a simple one,</v>

2763
02:14:56.341 --> 02:14:57.174
<v Speaker 1>so I like family and loved ones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>companionship and community and finding </v>

2764
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:05.010
<v Speaker 1>something that you enjoy doing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>

2765
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It seems bigger than you or bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself but,</v>

2766
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but meaning like the meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is meaning?</v>

2767
02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>people so much existential anxiety and I</v>

2768
02:15:15.031 --> 02:15:19.560
<v Speaker 1>think is the cause of a lot of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because while you can question it,</v>

2769
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.453
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that that's one of </v>

2770
02:15:22.411 --> 02:15:27.411
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of rationality is that see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians associated,</v>

2771
02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the Catholics did this to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2772
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:30.653
<v Speaker 1>They associated rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality with a proclivity to </v>

2773
02:15:33.871 --> 02:15:37.140
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because rationality tends to fall</v>

2774
02:15:37.141 --> 02:15:37.974
<v Speaker 1>in love with its own productions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence has this like inbuilt </v>

2775
02:15:40.141 --> 02:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>arrogance and the Egyptians in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular were really insightful.</v>

2776
02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:46.073
<v Speaker 1>They tried to replace the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as the highest virtue with </v>

2777
02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:50.004
<v Speaker 1>the idea of attention as the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue because something Elvis Huxley </v>

2778
02:15:52.621 --> 02:15:55.530
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book called Island Island was</v>

2779
02:15:55.531 --> 02:15:58.770
<v Speaker 1>an island that was populated by head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of birds on it and the birds could</v>

2780
02:15:58.771 --> 02:16:01.920
<v Speaker 1>talk and all they did was say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to remind everybody on the</v>

2781
02:16:01.921 --> 02:16:05.050
<v Speaker 1>island to pay attention all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

2782
02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you can undermine your sense of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can question it.</v>

2783
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:09.023
<v Speaker 1>But the best thing to do is to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to when it manifests </v>

2784
02:16:12.061 --> 02:16:13.480
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a.</v>

2785
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a phenomenon like like color or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like or like love or like beauty,</v>

2786
02:16:18.721 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exists.</v>

2787
02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:20.993
<v Speaker 1>It isn't something you created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you discover and you can </v>

2788
02:16:23.551 --> 02:16:24.384
<v Speaker 1>discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to watch it like you're </v>

2789
02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:27.840
<v Speaker 1>ignorant about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

2790
02:16:27.841 --> 02:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm gonna I,</v>

2791
02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taught,</v>

2792
02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 1>told</v>

2793
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.960
<v Speaker 4>my clinical clients to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my students was,</v>

2794
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 4>watch yourself for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just watch,</v>

2795
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:35.434
<v Speaker 4>like you don't know who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>notice when you're doing something that </v>

2796
02:16:38.261 --> 02:16:40.600
<v Speaker 4>you're engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like you'll see it.</v>

2797
02:16:40.601 --> 02:16:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's only 10 minutes because your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life is pretty out of balance,</v>

2798
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:44.164
<v Speaker 4>but you'll see that whole man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was engaged in something there for 10 </v>

2799
02:16:46.121 --> 02:16:47.050
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2800
02:16:47.051 --> 02:16:48.340
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was,</v>

2801
02:16:48.341 --> 02:16:50.410
<v Speaker 4>what did you do that was right that </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaged you?</v>

2802
02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:53.260
<v Speaker 4>You were in the right place at the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2803
02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:56.140
<v Speaker 4>doing the right thing for a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

2804
02:16:56.170 --> 02:17:00.640
<v Speaker 4>What were the preconditions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this line in the new testament.</v>

2805
02:17:00.850 --> 02:17:01.683
<v Speaker 4>Christ says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kingdom of God is spread across the </v>

2806
02:17:03.431 --> 02:17:06.070
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but men do not see it and that's what it</v>

2807
02:17:06.071 --> 02:17:06.904
<v Speaker 4>refers to is that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Wander into paradise now and then </v>

2808
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:11.583
<v Speaker 4>when you're engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're deeply engaged in something </v>

2809
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 4>but you don't notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think,</v>

2810
02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:16.473
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the right place and everything's </v>

2811
02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:18.513
<v Speaker 4>working out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means I've got it right somehow and </v>

2812
02:17:20.921 --> 02:17:23.950
<v Speaker 4>then I need to practice being there more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more and more,</v>

2813
02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:24.813
<v Speaker 4>which is while that's the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to try to practice and that's to </v>

2814
02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 4>make that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come to some negotiated,</v>

2815
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:34.750
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's it.</v>

2816
02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:35.603
<v Speaker 4>It's to come to a negotiation with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic sense of meaning and to </v>

2817
02:17:38.321 --> 02:17:39.154
<v Speaker 4>realize it as a fact rather than just as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an opinion or or something that's </v>

2818
02:17:43.091 --> 02:17:44.520
<v Speaker 4>secondary because it's annoying</v>

2819
02:17:44.610 --> 02:17:45.443
<v Speaker 3>concept for people though would be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of who they are and what they're </v>

2820
02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:51.300
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could recreate that so when they do</v>

2821
02:17:51.301 --> 02:17:52.134
<v Speaker 3>feel that feeling of meaning that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could figure out a way to get back into </v>

2822
02:17:54.601 --> 02:17:58.180
<v Speaker 3>that state and what were all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extenuating circumstances and where,</v>

2823
02:17:58.190 --> 02:18:00.500
<v Speaker 3>where's my head at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What caused me to have this,</v>

2824
02:18:00.670 --> 02:18:02.250
<v Speaker 3>this feeling like things were right?</v>

2825
02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:02.841
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2826
02:18:02.841 --> 02:18:04.550
<v Speaker 4>it's like someone gives you a gift and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

2827
02:18:04.551 --> 02:18:05.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like that gift again.</v>

2828
02:18:05.661 --> 02:18:06.171
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2829
02:18:06.171 --> 02:18:09.110
<v Speaker 4>well you have to figure out what it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you did to deserve it,</v>

2830
02:18:09.111 --> 02:18:10.500
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

2831
02:18:10.501 --> 02:18:12.680
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it requires a fair bit of.</v>

2832
02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:15.320
<v Speaker 4>It requires a fair bit of careful </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflection,</v>

2833
02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:17.960
<v Speaker 4>but it also requires that ignorance is </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to think,</v>

2834
02:18:17.961 --> 02:18:19.040
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who I am.</v>

2835
02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:21.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find some things </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>

2836
02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:22.273
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might not even be things you want </v>

2837
02:18:23.691 --> 02:18:25.760
<v Speaker 4>to find meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be things that you might even</v>

2838
02:18:25.761 --> 02:18:27.370
<v Speaker 4>be ashamed of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2839
02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:28.213
<v Speaker 4>because sometimes people are interested </v>
<v Speaker 4>in things that they don't think that </v>

2840
02:18:31.461 --> 02:18:33.290
<v Speaker 4>they should be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe you'll,</v>

2841
02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:34.710
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a guy who was,</v>

2842
02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.840
<v Speaker 4>who was kind of a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who was,</v>

2843
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:38.703
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>socialized to be real tough guy and he </v>

2844
02:18:40.251 --> 02:18:43.520
<v Speaker 4>finds out that he's kind of interested </v>
<v Speaker 4>in art or aesthetics.</v>

2845
02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:44.001
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2846
02:18:44.001 --> 02:18:47.000
<v Speaker 4>he's shamed that because maybe it's too </v>
<v Speaker 4>feminine or whatever.</v>

2847
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:48.623
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's doesn't matter because that's </v>

2848
02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:50.354
<v Speaker 4>actually speaking that that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's speaking to him from </v>

2849
02:18:52.971 --> 02:18:56.300
<v Speaker 4>the core of his genuine being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna have to pursue that,</v>

2850
02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:57.253
<v Speaker 4>or you might find that someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really agreeable and kind of a pushover </v>

2851
02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.313
<v Speaker 4>stands up to someone just once at work </v>
<v Speaker 4>says what they really think and then </v>

2852
02:19:07.761 --> 02:19:08.960
<v Speaker 4>they realized afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2853
02:19:08.961 --> 02:19:10.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was exactly right,</v>

2854
02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.170
<v Speaker 4>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2855
02:19:12.171 --> 02:19:14.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've decided when I was a little kid,</v>

2856
02:19:14.061 --> 02:19:16.370
<v Speaker 4>maybe they had a harsh father and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided when they were four,</v>

2857
02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I've never going to be angry in my whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2858
02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:19.093
<v Speaker 4>There's something wrong with aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they've gone out of their way their </v>

2859
02:19:21.321 --> 02:19:22.154
<v Speaker 4>whole life to be free of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they find out the one day they </v>

2860
02:19:25.311 --> 02:19:26.144
<v Speaker 4>stand up for themselves that that whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'd parsed off as inappropriate </v>

2861
02:19:29.841 --> 02:19:32.780
<v Speaker 4>is actually contains exactly what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to put themselves together.</v>

2862
02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:35.720
<v Speaker 4>Or do you find what you need where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>least want to look?</v>

2863
02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:39.730
<v Speaker 4>That's the old chemical dictum in sterk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wiliness infinite tour.</v>

2864
02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:40.230
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2865
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:41.063
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to you about activists </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's something that you brought </v>

2866
02:19:44.471 --> 02:19:46.680
<v Speaker 3>up earlier saying that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2867
02:19:46.710 --> 02:19:47.543
<v Speaker 3>you find them appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what you think the </v>

2868
02:19:51.161 --> 02:19:56.161
<v Speaker 3>motivation of a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly radical left wing activists</v>

2869
02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:01.500
<v Speaker 3>that want to shut down lectures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen people down in these auditoriums.</v>

2870
02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:06.160
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the motivation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people is and what do you.</v>

2871
02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:07.540
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the root of it?</v>

2872
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's a quick route to moral</v>

2873
02:20:12.141 --> 02:20:14.270
<v Speaker 4>virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2874
02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.113
<v Speaker 4>like it's actually really hard to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself together and you have to do </v>

2875
02:20:18.291 --> 02:20:21.160
<v Speaker 4>that in ways that you can't trump it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2876
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:25.370
<v Speaker 4>because most of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with you are kind of low.</v>

2877
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 4>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second rate and embarrassing your all,</v>

2878
02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:30.554
<v Speaker 4>your stupid little habits and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>proclivity to procrastinate and all the </v>

2879
02:20:32.961 --> 02:20:33.794
<v Speaker 4>things that you're minorly ashamed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have to work on those </v>

2880
02:20:36.321 --> 02:20:37.154
<v Speaker 4>slowly because the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be able to fix them </v>

2881
02:20:39.891 --> 02:20:40.724
<v Speaker 4>quickly is low and you can't really brag</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because it's so embarrassing </v>

2882
02:20:45.181 --> 02:20:46.970
<v Speaker 4>just to admit that they exist to begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2883
02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:47.804
<v Speaker 4>You can hardly brag about it and it sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of painstaking private work and you </v>

2884
02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:53.233
<v Speaker 4>don't get a lot of social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get a lot of quick social </v>

2885
02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 4>status for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's effortful,</v>

2886
02:20:57.470 --> 02:21:00.200
<v Speaker 4>embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humbling and difficult,</v>

2887
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:01.423
<v Speaker 4>and then you can do something like be an</v>
<v Speaker 4>activist and you get all that public </v>

2888
02:21:05.301 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 4>acclaim for being on the good side with </v>
<v Speaker 4>no effort whatsoever.</v>

2889
02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:12.720
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that</v>

2890
02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:16.090
<v Speaker 3>any motivation at all to try to make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world a better place?</v>

2891
02:21:16.091 --> 02:21:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of it.</v>

2892
02:21:19.031 --> 02:21:19.601
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2893
02:21:19.601 --> 02:21:24.601
<v Speaker 3>I think it's flavored by this desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast your virtue.</v>

2894
02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:26.843
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's very difficult to make the </v>

2895
02:21:27.841 --> 02:21:29.520
<v Speaker 4>world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2896
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:30.503
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean young people have a messianic </v>

2897
02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:36.330
<v Speaker 4>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing that was documented</v>

2898
02:21:36.331 --> 02:21:38.750
<v Speaker 4>by piaget that there's a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2899
02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:41.740
<v Speaker 4>in late adolescence where you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make the world a better place.</v>

2900
02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's probably part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>impulse to,</v>

2901
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.983
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>establish a permanent relationship and </v>

2902
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:51.750
<v Speaker 4>have a family and take care of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2903
02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.390
<v Speaker 4>and to take on some of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2904
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:55.463
<v Speaker 4>It's the psychological precursor to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's reasonable for smart young </v>

2905
02:22:00.361 --> 02:22:01.194
<v Speaker 4>people to be concerned about broader </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical issues if they tilt in </v>

2906
02:22:05.161 --> 02:22:05.994
<v Speaker 4>that direction as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's all too easy for that to be </v>

2907
02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 4>pathologized into resentment for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for those who seem to have more unfairly</v>

2908
02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:21.360
<v Speaker 4>and also to take the easy route out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there aren't easy routes.</v>

2909
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>There are only difficult routes to doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>useful things and it's better just to</v>

2910
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

2911
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there's some impulse to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2912
02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:32.844
<v Speaker 2>there's some wish that things could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>less unfair and that fewer people could </v>

2913
02:22:36.451 --> 02:22:37.284
<v Speaker 2>suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of a low level virtue </v>

2914
02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reflects of compassion.</v>

2915
02:22:42.810 --> 02:22:43.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2916
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's without merit because it's the,</v>

2917
02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:49.100
<v Speaker 2>that compassion is the basis for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to take care of,</v>

2918
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:52.590
<v Speaker 2>of people who are ill and and infants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

2919
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 2>This low level like where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not thought through.</v>

2920
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Things are complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to.</v>

2921
02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make complicated systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>work better and it's really easy to make</v>

2922
02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:03.864
<v Speaker 2>them work worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about activists that want to shut </v>

2923
02:23:06.031 --> 02:23:08.520
<v Speaker 2>down certain speakers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who's,</v>

2924
02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:13.980
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fairly innocuous in terms of the net.</v>

2925
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Here's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers.</v>

2926
02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see a good argument for </v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting her down.</v>

2927
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 2>She's so polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a feminist.</v>

2928
02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:25.790
<v Speaker 2>She's well read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a really nice person and Janice is</v>

2929
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:27.210
<v Speaker 2>like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the Canada.</v>

2930
02:23:27.350 --> 02:23:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It sort of person doesn't make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people would shout her down.</v>

2931
02:23:31.291 --> 02:23:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Yet they do say horrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

2932
02:23:34.471 --> 02:23:35.304
<v Speaker 2>They mischaracterize her in a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal way that it completely </v>

2933
02:23:40.741 --> 02:23:44.120
<v Speaker 2>invalidates their argument or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition to her,</v>

2934
02:23:44.121 --> 02:23:46.710
<v Speaker 2>to anyone is paying attention to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said.</v>

2935
02:23:46.770 --> 02:23:47.161
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2936
02:23:47.161 --> 02:23:48.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is.</v>

2937
02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.390
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is also just immature acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2938
02:23:51.470 --> 02:23:52.303
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an arrogance tolerated and I </v>

2939
02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>very strange way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2940
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.823
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2941
02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2942
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:03.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of our doubt,</v>

2943
02:24:03.391 --> 02:24:04.224
<v Speaker 2>I suppose about authority on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's and our willingness to assume that </v>

2944
02:24:08.191 --> 02:24:11.100
<v Speaker 2>all authority is contaminated by power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's shunned.</v>

2945
02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Heckling too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you have,</v>

2946
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:14.543
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a play or a musical or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're singing a song and someone just </v>

2947
02:24:17.521 --> 02:24:20.160
<v Speaker 2>decided to start screaming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that person's an asshole.</v>

2948
02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:22.410
<v Speaker 2>But if you're espousing and opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

2949
02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 2>and that person decides to scream out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2950
02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:25.524
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So under the guise of moral virtue on </v>

2951
02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:31.080
<v Speaker 2>tolerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undeserved access to power.</v>

2952
02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2953
02:24:32.461 --> 02:24:36.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's no wonder that radical leftists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular concentrate on power.</v>

2954
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Everything's about power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then it's okay if they use power as</v>

2955
02:24:40.411 --> 02:24:42.420
<v Speaker 2>part of their means of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2956
02:24:42.421 --> 02:24:44.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just playing power games.</v>

2957
02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:45.533
<v Speaker 2>It's perfectly reasonable even </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for me to play power games </v>

2958
02:24:47.911 --> 02:24:50.100
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm oppressed compared to you.</v>

2959
02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:51.173
<v Speaker 2>If everything's power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everybody gets to yell and there's </v>

2960
02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:55.950
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I realized about about</v>

2961
02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:01.080
<v Speaker 2>recently as well is that there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate about free speech.</v>

2962
02:25:01.350 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly not the way that we think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2963
02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's the classical defense of</v>

2964
02:25:06.421 --> 02:25:07.254
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the classical defense of free </v>

2965
02:25:08.761 --> 02:25:09.594
<v Speaker 2>speeches that it's better for both of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're able to exchange our opinions </v>

2966
02:25:14.101 --> 02:25:18.210
<v Speaker 2>because I have the opportunity to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>from you and you have the opportunity to</v>

2967
02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:19.044
<v Speaker 2>learn from me and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to learn from your own </v>

2968
02:25:21.601 --> 02:25:24.170
<v Speaker 2>mistakes and social feedback and so do</v>

2969
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:28.060
<v Speaker 4>I and negotiation beats war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2970
02:25:28.061 --> 02:25:28.894
<v Speaker 4>so that's kind of the classical now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's predicated on some </v>

2971
02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:36.370
<v Speaker 4>assumptions and those are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an autonomous being.</v>

2972
02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:37.593
<v Speaker 4>You're capable of formulating an opinion</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's actually unique to you and </v>

2973
02:25:41.111 --> 02:25:41.944
<v Speaker 4>that in dialogue we can mutually modify </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other's unique opinions in a way </v>

2974
02:25:46.751 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 4>that produces a mutually harmonious and </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial outcome.</v>

2975
02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 4>That's all the predicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2976
02:25:52.570 --> 02:25:54.730
<v Speaker 4>the people who are opposed to free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>

2977
02:25:54.731 --> 02:25:55.564
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that they're trying to shut </v>

2978
02:25:57.341 --> 02:25:59.730
<v Speaker 4>down people whose opinions are different</v>
<v Speaker 4>than theirs.</v>

2979
02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:00.573
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that they're opposed to the idea </v>

2980
02:26:02.951 --> 02:26:07.951
<v Speaker 4>that free speech exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way deeper problem because at the</v>

2981
02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:11.890
<v Speaker 4>bottom of the postmodernist mess is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>following assumption is that,</v>

2982
02:26:12.250 --> 02:26:14.050
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no.</v>

2983
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:20.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no one way of interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world that's preferable to any other</v>

2984
02:26:20.231 --> 02:26:24.910
<v Speaker 4>way and so what people do is organize </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves into hierarchies of power and</v>

2985
02:26:24.911 --> 02:26:25.744
<v Speaker 4>then struggle for dominance within the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies and then the hierarchy </v>

2986
02:26:28.211 --> 02:26:29.440
<v Speaker 4>struggled between each other.</v>

2987
02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:32.200
<v Speaker 4>So it's a landscape of worrying </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>

2988
02:26:32.201 --> 02:26:33.034
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a person and that you have an </v>

2989
02:26:36.191 --> 02:26:37.024
<v Speaker 4>opinion but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just the mouthpiece of your </v>

2990
02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:45.750
<v Speaker 4>privileged hierarchy and so am I and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's incommensurate.</v>

2991
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:46.743
<v Speaker 4>If we're from different hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there isn't a you talking to me that </v>

2992
02:26:49.841 --> 02:26:50.674
<v Speaker 4>could come to an agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just you acting as a mouthpiece </v>

2993
02:26:52.931 --> 02:26:57.100
<v Speaker 4>for your power and me acting as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouthpiece for my power and so since I'm</v>

2994
02:26:57.101 --> 02:27:00.130
<v Speaker 4>part of my group and I want to win </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's all about power,</v>

2995
02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.380
<v Speaker 4>then why the hell would I ever want you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk?</v>

2996
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.573
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I have anything to learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>from you or even that learning is </v>

2997
02:27:05.441 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even that there are two people having</v>

2998
02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:09.454
<v Speaker 4>a discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing but the mouthpiece of </v>

2999
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:16.180
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two mouthpieces of power warring</v>

3000
02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:18.160
<v Speaker 4>and so why should I listen to you?</v>

3001
02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll just shut you down because then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>

3002
02:27:21.330 --> 02:27:22.163
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this free speech debate isn't about </v>

3003
02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:25.583
<v Speaker 4>whose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose opinion should be allowed within </v>

3004
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:32.590
<v Speaker 4>an overarching framework where free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speeches is a real thing.</v>

3005
02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:36.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a debate about whether there such a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing as free speech at all.</v>

3006
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:40.270
<v Speaker 4>The radical postmodernist types.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They denied even that.</v>

3007
02:27:40.271 --> 02:27:42.940
<v Speaker 4>There's such a thing as an autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual in any way.</v>

3008
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:44.223
<v Speaker 4>You're just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just the nexus of economic </v>

3009
02:27:46.241 --> 02:27:48.430
<v Speaker 4>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economic and social forces.</v>

3010
02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:51.850
<v Speaker 4>You're entirely socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no you.</v>

3011
02:27:52.690 --> 02:27:53.523
<v Speaker 4>These are deep criticisms like I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've made this case before that the </v>

3012
02:27:56.771 --> 02:27:57.604
<v Speaker 4>postmodern types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although they have to ally themselves </v>

3013
02:27:59.981 --> 02:28:02.650
<v Speaker 4>with the Marxist for for reasons that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to go into,</v>

3014
02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:05.800
<v Speaker 4>they are going after things that are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental.</v>

3015
02:28:05.801 --> 02:28:07.570
<v Speaker 4>You can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

3016
02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:11.650
<v Speaker 4>There is no autonomous individual in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodern world.</v>

3017
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:13.473
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a modern Western enlightenment </v>

3018
02:28:14.891 --> 02:28:15.370
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint.</v>

3019
02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:16.203
<v Speaker 4>That's or a Christian viewpoint or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Judeo Christian viewpoint or maybe an </v>

3020
02:28:19.391 --> 02:28:23.180
<v Speaker 4>abrahamic religion viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the hell knows it might be that that</v>

3021
02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:27.020
<v Speaker 4>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the nexus of sociological forces.</v>

3022
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.033
<v Speaker 4>There's no integrated self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have ideas or opinions and </v>

3023
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:35.030
<v Speaker 4>there's no dialogue between us that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't exist.</v>

3024
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:37.730
<v Speaker 4>There's your group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your identity,</v>

3025
02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:41.120
<v Speaker 4>your struggle for power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's all this is.</v>

3026
02:28:41.121 --> 02:28:41.954
<v Speaker 4>Your interpretation of this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the fundamental essence of </v>

3027
02:28:46.491 --> 02:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially.</v>

3028
02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:53.270
<v Speaker 4>It's especially true in the format </v>
<v Speaker 4>espoused by Derrida and foucault for Co.</v>

3029
02:28:53.271 --> 02:28:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Everything's about power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is about power,</v>

3030
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:57.043
<v Speaker 4>and dara dara was definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why he criticized the idea of </v>

3031
02:28:59.241 --> 02:29:00.074
<v Speaker 4>logo centrism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Logos is that ability of the individual </v>

3032
02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:08.270
<v Speaker 4>to engage in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Route for dialogue is logos or logic.</v>

3033
02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:10.700
<v Speaker 4>That's all criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all gone.</v>

3034
02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:13.280
<v Speaker 4>The identity politics players,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the serious,</v>

3035
02:29:13.350 --> 02:29:15.560
<v Speaker 4>the people who are serious about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophically,</v>

3036
02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 4>they don't believe in the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>autonomous individual that's gone,</v>

3037
02:29:21.430 --> 02:29:23.440
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like they're playing a game </v>
<v Speaker 4>within,</v>

3038
02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

3039
02:29:24.311 --> 02:29:25.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a game.</v>

3040
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:27.063
<v Speaker 4>WE're all playing a game where we agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>on some things and we're just </v>

3041
02:29:29.411 --> 02:29:31.030
<v Speaker 4>disagreeing about the details.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3042
02:29:31.031 --> 02:29:31.930
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3043
02:29:31.931 --> 02:29:32.700
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3044
02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:35.920
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to make that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This critique is way,</v>

3045
02:29:35.921 --> 02:29:36.754
<v Speaker 4>way deeper than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why derrida was opposed to the </v>

3046
02:29:40.331 --> 02:29:41.164
<v Speaker 4>idea of logo centrism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't believe in the idea of an </v>

3047
02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:44.273
<v Speaker 4>autonomous individual that didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a fiction set up by those </v>

3048
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:49.563
<v Speaker 4>who have used the idea of the autonomous</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual to advance their power </v>

3049
02:29:53.981 --> 02:29:58.060
<v Speaker 4>maneuvering within the confines of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>colonialist.</v>

3050
02:29:59.140 --> 02:30:00.310
<v Speaker 4>The colonialists west.</v>

3051
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:01.423
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's the rationalization for that </v>

3052
02:30:02.551 --> 02:30:06.190
<v Speaker 3>perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this to enhance their argument to try</v>

3053
02:30:06.191 --> 02:30:06.580
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3054
02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:11.580
<v Speaker 3>to push forth their ideas in less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less debatable way.</v>

3055
02:30:12.210 --> 02:30:13.043
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

3056
02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:15.460
<v Speaker 4>I think the motivation is hatred for </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence,</v>

3057
02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.610
<v Speaker 4>hatred for competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe that I've been trying to</v>

3058
02:30:18.611 --> 02:30:22.110
<v Speaker 4>do down like go down as deep as I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>to find out why the layers of the.</v>

3059
02:30:22.111 --> 02:30:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's cain and abel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3060
02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:25.113
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that because I can't understand </v>

3061
02:30:27.731 --> 02:30:29.110
<v Speaker 4>the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise it's like,</v>

3062
02:30:29.111 --> 02:30:29.944
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you tearing these things down </v>

3063
02:30:30.941 --> 02:30:32.300
<v Speaker 4>while it's on the base?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3064
02:30:32.650 --> 02:30:34.750
<v Speaker 4>we have sympathy for the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3065
02:30:34.751 --> 02:30:36.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why?</v>

3066
02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Like wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wearing your conceptualization.</v>

3067
02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:42.850
<v Speaker 4>does that iDea of sympathy for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressed come from.</v>

3068
02:30:42.851 --> 02:30:45.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have the iDea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual in your conceptualization.</v>

3069
02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:50.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3070
02:30:50.491 --> 02:30:52.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy any of that.</v>

3071
02:30:52.170 --> 02:30:54.870
<v Speaker 4>I think it's cain and abel row all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way down.</v>

3072
02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:55.833
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the scandinavian model where </v>

3073
02:30:58.721 --> 02:31:03.721
<v Speaker 3>they've made it incredibly equal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this massive effort to take away</v>

3074
02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.293
<v Speaker 3>any opportunity or to to to rather open </v>
<v Speaker 3>up every possible opportunity for women </v>

3075
02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:16.420
<v Speaker 3>that men also have and you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3076
02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 3>these differences in genders actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>accentuate because of this.</v>

3077
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you Think that maybe what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing also,</v>

3078
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:30.660
<v Speaker 3>even in terms of the postmodernists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftist versus people in the</v>

3079
02:31:30.661 --> 02:31:31.494
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this same sort of competition aspect of </v>

3080
02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:34.284
<v Speaker 3>it is also problematic because it's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why there's so much </v>

3081
02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:40.830
<v Speaker 3>debate in the first place and that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>

3082
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:46.140
<v Speaker 3>If we had maybe more middle ground and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more opportunity,</v>

3083
02:31:46.141 --> 02:31:46.974
<v Speaker 3>there would be less of an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be less of a reason to have </v>

3084
02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:52.500
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3085
02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:53.413
<v Speaker 3>these extreme polar opposites that may </v>
<v Speaker 3>be embracing of more like there's </v>

3086
02:31:58.021 --> 02:32:02.490
<v Speaker 3>certain socialist aspects of our society</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we just accept.</v>

3087
02:32:02.490 --> 02:32:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the fire department,</v>

3088
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:05.303
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3089
02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:07.920
<v Speaker 3>like universal provision of </v>
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure.</v>

3090
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:08.441
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3091
02:32:08.441 --> 02:32:11.250
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's schools should be,</v>

3092
02:32:11.251 --> 02:32:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I think more emphasized in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>

3093
02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:14.273
<v Speaker 3>but it it gears towards privatized </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools for people with higher incomes </v>

3094
02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:24.980
<v Speaker 3>which gets away more from socialism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of reinforces capitalist more.</v>

3095
02:32:25.261 --> 02:32:26.094
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think things like maybe perhaps </v>

3096
02:32:28.261 --> 02:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>even universal basic income or certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>universal health care with you,</v>

3097
02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:34.410
<v Speaker 3>what you guys have in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we don't have here,</v>

3098
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:39.590
<v Speaker 3>and definitely a higher education making</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher education,</v>

3099
02:32:39.931 --> 02:32:44.390
<v Speaker 3>far more accessible and far less costly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop subsidizing these student Loans.</v>

3100
02:32:44.391 --> 02:32:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Stop making student loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you can never ask.</v>

3101
02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:47.653
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is part of the eternal </v>

3102
02:32:48.651 --> 02:32:49.371
<v Speaker 4>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3103
02:32:49.371 --> 02:32:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Because we've already talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>utility of hierarchies and the necessity</v>

3104
02:32:53.691 --> 02:32:57.530
<v Speaker 4>of putting those who can in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the consequence of that,</v>

3105
02:32:57.531 --> 02:33:00.920
<v Speaker 4>which is an unequal distribution of both</v>
<v Speaker 4>talent and resources.</v>

3106
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want that to get so steep that</v>

3107
02:33:03.441 --> 02:33:06.830
<v Speaker 4>people stack up at the bottom because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all society starts to destabilize</v>

3108
02:33:06.831 --> 02:33:07.664
<v Speaker 4>and so you have to have a continual </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion between the left and the </v>

3109
02:33:09.861 --> 02:33:14.150
<v Speaker 4>right to see how you stop the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 4>from suffering.</v>

3110
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:15.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from hitting zero because zero is not </v>

3111
02:33:16.881 --> 02:33:17.714
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't play when you hit zero and </v>

3112
02:33:19.161 --> 02:33:19.994
<v Speaker 4>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I don't think there is a </v>

3113
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:23.563
<v Speaker 4>universal solution to that problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the problem keeps manifesting </v>

3114
02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:28.313
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about a death and eternal problem </v>

3115
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:30.440
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem.</v>

3116
02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:33.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a set of problems that'll never </v>
<v Speaker 4>go away.</v>

3117
02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:34.873
<v Speaker 4>Now what the problems are change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that there are problems </v>

3118
02:33:37.911 --> 02:33:39.170
<v Speaker 4>never go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3119
02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:40.813
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you have to produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies to solve those problems </v>

3120
02:33:42.891 --> 02:33:46.790
<v Speaker 4>never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the hierarchy's dispossess</v>

3121
02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:51.440
<v Speaker 4>never goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the detail shift all the time and so</v>

3122
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:52.423
<v Speaker 4>the whole reason that you need the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political discussion is to take a look </v>

3123
02:33:55.161 --> 02:33:59.150
<v Speaker 4>at the particulars of the hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the particulars of the dispossession</v>

3124
02:33:59.151 --> 02:33:59.661
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3125
02:33:59.661 --> 02:34:00.494
<v Speaker 4>well now we need to shim it up here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now we need to shim it up here and now </v>

3126
02:34:03.351 --> 02:34:07.310
<v Speaker 4>we need to adjust this and now we need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to adjust this because you can't come up</v>

3127
02:34:07.311 --> 02:34:08.144
<v Speaker 4>with a final solution to those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's partly why you have </v>

3128
02:34:11.031 --> 02:34:13.170
<v Speaker 4>consciousness itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3129
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:16.010
<v Speaker 4>because if you could automate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution,</v>

3130
02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:16.913
<v Speaker 4>imagine there was a permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's a permanent solution to </v>

3131
02:34:19.331 --> 02:34:20.164
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

3132
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:22.420
<v Speaker 4>You have a paRt of your brain that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathes.</v>

3133
02:34:23.050 --> 02:34:23.883
<v Speaker 4>You don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't adjust it while you do a bit </v>

3134
02:34:25.331 --> 02:34:27.190
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get my point.</v>

3135
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:30.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like problem taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3136
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.100
<v Speaker 4>there's other problems that are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fluid,</v>

3137
02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:34.173
<v Speaker 4>like they're eternal problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're so fluid in their detail </v>

3138
02:34:35.981 --> 02:34:39.730
<v Speaker 4>that you need awareness and linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity to address them.</v>

3139
02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:40.893
<v Speaker 4>And I would say the problem of hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dispossession fit exactly into that </v>

3140
02:34:44.891 --> 02:34:45.724
<v Speaker 4>category is that we're going to organize</v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves hierarchically because talent </v>

3141
02:34:49.781 --> 02:34:52.750
<v Speaker 4>is unequally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

3142
02:34:52.751 --> 02:34:53.584
<v Speaker 4>Like as soon as you invent basketball </v>
<v Speaker 4>and instantly you know there's one </v>

3143
02:34:56.321 --> 02:34:59.200
<v Speaker 4>percent of the population who are super </v>
<v Speaker 4>great at basketball.</v>

3144
02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:03.250
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you set up an arbitrary value</v>

3145
02:35:03.251 --> 02:35:04.390
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get hierarchy,</v>

3146
02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:05.853
<v Speaker 4>then there's the whole schlubs at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom that can put a ball in the hoop </v>

3147
02:35:09.611 --> 02:35:10.600
<v Speaker 4>to save their lives.</v>

3148
02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:13.630
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and That's an eternal problem.</v>

3149
02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:14.703
<v Speaker 4>That's why it says in the new testament </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the poor will be with us always a </v>

3150
02:35:17.171 --> 02:35:20.500
<v Speaker 4>very pessimistic if there's two lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3151
02:35:20.501 --> 02:35:23.920
<v Speaker 4>One is to those who have everything more</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be given.</v>

3152
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:25.930
<v Speaker 4>And from those who have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything will be taken.</v>

3153
02:35:26.470 --> 02:35:27.303
<v Speaker 4>That's a rough line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the second is the poor will be with </v>

3154
02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:30.910
<v Speaker 4>us always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3155
02:35:30.911 --> 02:35:31.930
<v Speaker 4>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3156
02:35:31.931 --> 02:35:32.764
<v Speaker 4>it's a reflection of what we just </v>
<v Speaker 4>described is that you're going to get </v>

3157
02:35:35.441 --> 02:35:38.140
<v Speaker 4>hierarchical structures in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to dispossess okay?</v>

3158
02:35:38.141 --> 02:35:40.720
<v Speaker 4>So then what we want to do is we want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>use mercy.</v>

3159
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Say justice gives you what you deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's on the competitive end.</v>

3160
02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:47.193
<v Speaker 4>You get what you deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's this old idea in old </v>

3161
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:50.710
<v Speaker 4>religious idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a good idea.</v>

3162
02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:52.323
<v Speaker 4>God rules with two hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right hand is justice in the left hand </v>

3163
02:35:55.571 --> 02:35:56.404
<v Speaker 4>is mercy.</v>

3164
02:35:56.530 --> 02:35:57.363
<v Speaker 4>Justice means you get what you deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the world can't survive that way </v>

3165
02:36:00.431 --> 02:36:02.980
<v Speaker 4>because people are flawed and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes.</v>

3166
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 4>And if you only got exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>deserved,</v>

3167
02:36:05.890 --> 02:36:07.600
<v Speaker 4>it would be a hell of a world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3168
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:10.090
<v Speaker 4>Because you'd be punished for every </v>
<v Speaker 4>single mistake you make.</v>

3169
02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:11.163
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you be held accountable in a way that </v>

3170
02:36:12.161 --> 02:36:12.994
<v Speaker 4>would be unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that has to be tempered with mercy </v>

3171
02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:17.273
<v Speaker 4>and and so maybe the left is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of the distribution that tempers </v>

3172
02:36:21.551 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 4>with mercy when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's functioning properly,</v>

3173
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:28.750
<v Speaker 4>but it can degenerate into that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>like resentment of the,</v>

3174
02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:29.913
<v Speaker 4>of the successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a danger on the right you </v>

3175
02:36:33.311 --> 02:36:35.760
<v Speaker 4>have the opposite danger which is well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3176
02:36:35.761 --> 02:36:39.700
<v Speaker 4>you advance because of your competence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then that can also fly.</v>

3177
02:36:39.701 --> 02:36:42.130
<v Speaker 4>And so you want to hang onto that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that position,</v>

3178
02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:44.860
<v Speaker 4>even though your know your competence no</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer justifies it,</v>

3179
02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:50.100
<v Speaker 4>you start to use the advantages of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>position to accrue benefits for yourself</v>

3180
02:36:50.411 --> 02:36:53.740
<v Speaker 4>that you did not earn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the proclivity of the,</v>

3181
02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.740
<v Speaker 4>of the hierarchy to become blind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical.</v>

3182
02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:58.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an eternal problem.</v>

3183
02:36:58.721 --> 02:36:59.400
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3184
02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:01.150
<v Speaker 4>the egyptians had a garden for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3185
02:37:01.151 --> 02:37:02.550
<v Speaker 4>cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3186
02:37:02.551 --> 02:37:05.620
<v Speaker 4>cyrus was the god of hierarchies and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was always threatened by seth,</v>

3187
02:37:05.650 --> 02:37:10.210
<v Speaker 4>who is evil brother in his evil brother </v>
<v Speaker 4>was always conspiring to overcome him.</v>

3188
02:37:10.211 --> 02:37:11.044
<v Speaker 4>And that's the problem with hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they tilt towards tyranny and </v>

3189
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:16.440
<v Speaker 4>the reasonable says that watch</v>

3190
02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:18.380
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchies because they tilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards tyranny.</v>

3191
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:19.243
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3192
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:20.593
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that the idea of </v>

3193
02:37:24.081 --> 02:37:24.914
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy itself is flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean that all </v>

3194
02:37:28.191 --> 02:37:31.070
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies are tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going way too far.</v>

3195
02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:31.973
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the scandinavian model</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has revealed that when you do make </v>

3196
02:37:36.931 --> 02:37:40.470
<v Speaker 3>things more equal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will find that people generally tend</v>

3197
02:37:40.471 --> 02:37:45.471
<v Speaker 3>to gravitate more towards traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender roles that does this.</v>

3198
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that this makes people </v>
<v Speaker 3>happier?</v>

3199
02:37:49.230 --> 02:37:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Has it been observed that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>happier results?</v>

3200
02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:54.713
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The indices of life satisfaction are </v>

3201
02:37:58.401 --> 02:37:59.234
<v Speaker 2>pretty high in scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if anybody has done an </v>

3202
02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:05.060
<v Speaker 2>analysis that would indicate whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3203
02:38:05.490 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>the sexual sorting is a contributor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3204
02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

3205
02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:12.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean the general idea has been that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scandinavians are happier because </v>

3206
02:38:16.881 --> 02:38:19.820
<v Speaker 2>their societies are more egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3207
02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:20.833
<v Speaker 2>but they're not more egalitarian in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that men and women are also more </v>

3208
02:38:25.071 --> 02:38:28.970
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So men and women are more different,</v>

3209
02:38:28.971 --> 02:38:31.340
<v Speaker 2>but the opportunities are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian.</v>

3210
02:38:31.341 --> 02:38:32.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3211
02:38:32.121 --> 02:38:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so then,</v>

3212
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but then the societies are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more satisfied,</v>

3213
02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:36.553
<v Speaker 2>but it's tough because there's other </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables because the scandinavian </v>

3214
02:38:38.571 --> 02:38:41.750
<v Speaker 2>countries are relatively homogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3215
02:38:41.751 --> 02:38:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And more homogenous societies tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more peaceful and happier,</v>

3216
02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:48.500
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not more diverse societies.</v>

3217
02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:53.800
<v Speaker 2>And they're also small countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're somewhat easier to govern and</v>

3218
02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:57.530
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those.</v>

3219
02:38:57.950 --> 02:39:00.500
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be hard to parse out all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributors,</v>

3220
02:39:00.501 --> 02:39:01.334
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To figure out what it is that's making </v>

3221
02:39:02.301 --> 02:39:07.301
<v Speaker 2>the scandinavians relatively content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is almost like a super tribe versus</v>

3222
02:39:07.911 --> 02:39:08.744
<v Speaker 2>a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:39:09.010 --> 02:39:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3224
02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:10.433
<v Speaker 2>Well and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of societies in some sense </v>

3225
02:39:12.141 --> 02:39:14.640
<v Speaker 2>are easier to manage so there are</v>

3226
02:39:14.890 --> 02:39:15.723
<v Speaker 3>benefit to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this model that we could perhaps bring </v>

3227
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:21.063
<v Speaker 3>to the United States or to Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe mitigate some of the issues that </v>

3228
02:39:24.851 --> 02:39:25.684
<v Speaker 3>we have between the right and the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe there's some sort of a </v>

3229
02:39:28.211 --> 02:39:33.070
<v Speaker 3>compromise that will lead to a less less</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate and dispute.</v>

3230
02:39:33.290 --> 02:39:34.123
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you guys in the states are </v>

3231
02:39:35.931 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 2>doing real well actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>

3232
02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3233
02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.880
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your system of checks and balances seems</v>

3234
02:39:43.881 --> 02:39:46.070
<v Speaker 2>to work out pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fair bit of,</v>

3235
02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:50.300
<v Speaker 2>let's say left domination right now of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mainstream media.</v>

3236
02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:51.193
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a reasonable claim and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also of academia and have the </v>

3237
02:39:54.291 --> 02:39:55.124
<v Speaker 2>intelligentsia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the political system is skewed </v>

3238
02:39:57.291 --> 02:39:59.660
<v Speaker 2>pretty hard to the republican end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things at the moment.</v>

3239
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:02.870
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not a bad balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the last election,</v>

3240
02:40:03.170 --> 02:40:04.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe you could make a case </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps that things had tilted a little </v>

3241
02:40:08.001 --> 02:40:10.310
<v Speaker 2>too far to the republican side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

3242
02:40:10.311 --> 02:40:11.144
<v Speaker 2>that got balanced out because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats took the house again and it </v>

3243
02:40:14.251 --> 02:40:16.260
<v Speaker 2>seems like they were more moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats.</v>

3244
02:40:16.261 --> 02:40:19.880
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be the scuttlebutt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3245
02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious to me that your system </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't functioning well.</v>

3246
02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening that's making things look more</v>

3247
02:40:29.131 --> 02:40:29.964
<v Speaker 2>contentious than they are is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media is under such assault </v>

3248
02:40:35.010 --> 02:40:39.660
<v Speaker 2>by the up and coming media forms </v>
<v Speaker 2>colluding.</v>

3249
02:40:39.661 --> 02:40:40.494
<v Speaker 2>People like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as their financial models </v>

3250
02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:48.870
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate and as their journalistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards take a hit,</v>

3251
02:40:48.871 --> 02:40:49.704
<v Speaker 2>and as they lose their fact checkers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their time to be careful with the </v>

3252
02:40:52.141 --> 02:40:52.974
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they concentrate more on exaggerating </v>

3253
02:40:54.691 --> 02:40:57.840
<v Speaker 2>the extremes to attract attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3254
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:58.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an article published in the </v>

3255
02:40:59.401 --> 02:41:02.680
<v Speaker 2>atlantic monthly about a month ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that didn't.</v>

3256
02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:04.410
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you calculate these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

3257
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:05.244
<v Speaker 2>but that the radical leftists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical right wingers are only about </v>

3258
02:41:07.681 --> 02:41:08.514
<v Speaker 2>five percent of the population on each </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and that most the vast majority of </v>

3259
02:41:12.631 --> 02:41:13.464
<v Speaker 2>americans consider themselves something </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximating the relatively silent </v>

3260
02:41:16.861 --> 02:41:17.694
<v Speaker 2>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I don't think that things are </v>

3261
02:41:21.151 --> 02:41:21.984
<v Speaker 2>polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is as badly as they seem and it is also </v>

3262
02:41:25.771 --> 02:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>the case right now that if you poll </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and ask them about the conditions</v>

3263
02:41:29.761 --> 02:41:30.594
<v Speaker 2>of their life in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to say that they're doing </v>

3264
02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:35.190
<v Speaker 2>quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that other people aren't.</v>

3265
02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:38.550
<v Speaker 2>And so I Think maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this for sure,</v>

3266
02:41:38.551 --> 02:41:41.850
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think maybe that the technological</v>

3267
02:41:41.851 --> 02:41:42.684
<v Speaker 2>pressure that's being put on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media is driving extreme </v>

3268
02:41:45.601 --> 02:41:46.434
<v Speaker 2>political views as a means of gathering </v>
<v Speaker 2>the attention of a shrinking market </v>

3269
02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3270
02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:53.273
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how detrimental that is to us </v>

3271
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.293
<v Speaker 2>as a whole because we are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with this click bait you </v>

3272
02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:02.500
<v Speaker 2>nonsense headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3273
02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:03.241
<v Speaker 2>in every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

3274
02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:05.420
<v Speaker 2>everything is a dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's a war.</v>

3275
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Everything was nerve wracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3276
02:42:07.690 --> 02:42:08.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I noticed this years ago because </v>

3277
02:42:09.601 --> 02:42:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I really stopped watching the news or 25</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3278
02:42:13.141 --> 02:42:13.974
<v Speaker 2>although I've been heavily involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last two years because I noticed </v>

3279
02:42:16.621 --> 02:42:20.040
<v Speaker 2>that most of what passed for news wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my sense was,</v>

3280
02:42:20.041 --> 02:42:21.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't important in a month,</v>

3281
02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:23.033
<v Speaker 2>if it is an important month from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was never important and almost </v>

3282
02:42:25.801 --> 02:42:28.140
<v Speaker 2>everything that's news is important </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

3283
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:31.020
<v Speaker 2>and so I tried to stay away from that.</v>

3284
02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:35.550
<v Speaker 2>It was better for my peace of mind and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>often recommended to my clinical clients</v>

3285
02:42:35.551 --> 02:42:36.384
<v Speaker 2>who were depressed and anxious that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>shield themselves from the news as much </v>

3286
02:42:39.841 --> 02:42:43.590
<v Speaker 2>as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there's the news is everywhere,</v>

3287
02:42:44.010 --> 02:42:44.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.</v>

3288
02:42:44.851 --> 02:42:45.990
<v Speaker 2>It's twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's facebook,</v>

3289
02:42:45.991 --> 02:42:48.720
<v Speaker 2>it's youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're just inundated by it.</v>

3290
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:49.703
<v Speaker 2>It's like cnn on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 24 hour news cycle and it's </v>

3291
02:42:52.981 --> 02:42:53.814
<v Speaker 2>produced by everyone whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed or not and it's really high </v>

3292
02:42:58.261 --> 02:42:59.094
<v Speaker 2>emotion and I think that that is making </v>
<v Speaker 2>things look a lot worse to us than they </v>

3293
02:43:02.611 --> 02:43:03.444
<v Speaker 2>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also similar to what we </v>

3294
02:43:04.791 --> 02:43:05.624
<v Speaker 2>were talking about earlier when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reading comments on instagram or </v>

3295
02:43:09.301 --> 02:43:10.134
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's just an amount of </v>

3296
02:43:11.441 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3297
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.560
<v Speaker 2>That's incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can handle it.</v>

3298
02:43:14.561 --> 02:43:15.394
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you would navigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't navigate that many </v>

3299
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:17.740
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

3300
02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:18.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we have this dunbar's </v>

3301
02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:21.640
<v Speaker 2>number in our head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3302
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:24.490
<v Speaker 2>if you're dealing with hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people,</v>

3303
02:43:24.491 --> 02:43:25.324
<v Speaker 2>in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million followers that are constantly </v>

3304
02:43:26.891 --> 02:43:29.530
<v Speaker 2>interacting with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to fucking drive you mad.</v>

3305
02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:30.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what to do with it </v>

3306
02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:32.440
<v Speaker 2>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3307
02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what my ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation is to my twitter followers,</v>

3308
02:43:35.801 --> 02:43:36.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like there's a million people </v>

3309
02:43:37.241 --> 02:43:39.040
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't react to all of them.</v>

3310
02:43:39.430 --> 02:43:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3311
02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:41.373
<v Speaker 2>certainly I know one limitation which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that having it drive me insane is </v>

3312
02:43:45.911 --> 02:43:46.744
<v Speaker 2>probably not a good outcome for anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>except for those who hope that I would </v>

3313
02:43:50.231 --> 02:43:53.380
<v Speaker 2>fall back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say this is a personal thing,</v>

3314
02:43:53.381 --> 02:43:54.214
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're responding and the </v>

3315
02:43:55.350 --> 02:43:58.660
<v Speaker 2>mentions are to you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a lesser way perhaps,</v>

3316
02:43:58.661 --> 02:43:59.494
<v Speaker 2>but still also overwhelming is just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheer amount of information that's </v>

3317
02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:06.910
<v Speaker 2>available constantly about everything.</v>

3318
02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:08.213
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million stories every day </v>

3319
02:44:09.881 --> 02:44:12.040
<v Speaker 2>about every single thing that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>

3320
02:44:12.310 --> 02:44:13.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

3321
02:44:13.390 --> 02:44:18.390
<v Speaker 2>everywhere on the planet and how are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to navigate that?</v>

3322
02:44:18.730 --> 02:44:22.210
<v Speaker 2>How are you supposed to get through life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and concentrate on things that are truly</v>

3323
02:44:22.211 --> 02:44:23.044
<v Speaker 2>meaningful for you in the present moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>without being completely detached from </v>

3324
02:44:27.041 --> 02:44:27.874
<v Speaker 2>the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this balance that people try to </v>

3325
02:44:29.621 --> 02:44:30.454
<v Speaker 2>find that is so elusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to figure out how much to </v>

3326
02:44:34.301 --> 02:44:35.134
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of this political process do I </v>

3327
02:44:36.551 --> 02:44:37.960
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3328
02:44:37.961 --> 02:44:40.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the big technological challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3329
02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:40.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3330
02:44:40.721 --> 02:44:42.790
<v Speaker 2>we thought when I was a kid we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

3331
02:44:42.791 --> 02:44:43.624
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are sitting in front of the </v>

3332
02:44:43.931 --> 02:44:46.000
<v Speaker 2>television four hours a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3333
02:44:46.001 --> 02:44:47.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ain't seen nothing yet.</v>

3334
02:44:48.090 --> 02:44:49.480
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All day long.</v>

3335
02:44:49.481 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phones all day long.</v>

3336
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the phones are so much more powerful</v>

3337
02:44:53.291 --> 02:44:54.330
<v Speaker 2>than television that there.</v>

3338
02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:55.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a typewriter compared to a </v>

3339
02:44:55.901 --> 02:44:57.040
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3340
02:44:57.041 --> 02:44:57.611
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

3341
02:44:57.611 --> 02:44:58.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>

3342
02:44:58.700 --> 02:44:59.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

3343
02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:02.620
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know how to adjust to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>

3344
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:03.663
<v Speaker 2>but it's even worse than that because as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you adjust to the degree that </v>

3345
02:45:07.901 --> 02:45:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology changes on you.</v>

3346
02:45:09.810 --> 02:45:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was more immersive and it's always</v>

3347
02:45:12.551 --> 02:45:16.510
<v Speaker 2>leading in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a real mean.</v>

3348
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:17.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this especially with parents who </v>

3349
02:45:19.421 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 2>have teenage kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they know the phones aren't,</v>

3350
02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:23.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to some teenagers </v>

3351
02:45:25.001 --> 02:45:26.290
<v Speaker 2>lately about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3352
02:45:27.310 --> 02:45:28.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe these are kids that are getting </v>

3353
02:45:29.291 --> 02:45:31.580
<v Speaker 2>bullied on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like think,</v>

3354
02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:33.910
<v Speaker 2>well when I was 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3355
02:45:33.911 --> 02:45:34.744
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a rough time of life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to school and you've got your </v>

3356
02:45:36.761 --> 02:45:37.594
<v Speaker 2>friends and you've got your enemies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you come home and your friends </v>

3357
02:45:40.211 --> 02:45:41.740
<v Speaker 2>aren't there and neither are your </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>

3358
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3359
02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:45.700
<v Speaker 2>you're outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an outside of that.</v>

3360
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:49.150
<v Speaker 2>But now in social media there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3361
02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one kid I was talking to had moved </v>

3362
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:54.700
<v Speaker 2>schools and he's doing quite well in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new one,</v>

3363
02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:55.773
<v Speaker 2>but the people from the person's old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school are still after them on social </v>

3364
02:45:59.441 --> 02:46:01.720
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

3365
02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:04.150
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well just don't use your phone.</v>

3366
02:46:04.151 --> 02:46:04.961
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3367
02:46:04.961 --> 02:46:06.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell that to your teenager.</v>

3368
02:46:06.850 --> 02:46:08.890
<v Speaker 2>You try not using your phone for a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3369
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:10.191
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3370
02:46:10.191 --> 02:46:12.080
<v Speaker 2>the teenager is going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage the phone.</v>

3371
02:46:12.081 --> 02:46:12.681
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3372
02:46:12.681 --> 02:46:14.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't manage the phone.</v>

3373
02:46:14.570 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can manage the flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just teenagers.</v>

3374
02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:23.080
<v Speaker 2>My middle daughter is 10 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our friends have phones.</v>

3375
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:24.833
<v Speaker 2>All of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like two of her friends that </v>

3376
02:46:26.181 --> 02:46:29.420
<v Speaker 2>don't have phones and they come over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>house and we have a rule at our house.</v>

3377
02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:31.970
<v Speaker 2>You can't use a phone like once you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the house,</v>

3378
02:46:31.971 --> 02:46:33.770
<v Speaker 2>there's no phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have friends come over the house.</v>

3379
02:46:33.771 --> 02:46:36.170
<v Speaker 2>They want to constantly be on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and we said like,</v>

3380
02:46:36.171 --> 02:46:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they look you like,</v>

3381
02:46:38.271 --> 02:46:40.010
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my life.</v>

3382
02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:41.293
<v Speaker 2>My life is my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to make twitter posts and </v>

3383
02:46:43.611 --> 02:46:46.270
<v Speaker 2>instagram and they want to do facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they want,</v>

3384
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:47.473
<v Speaker 2>they want to snap chat with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bunny ears on and that these kids </v>

3385
02:46:50.691 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 2>are just doing this all day long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are mastering the technology.</v>

3386
02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:55.304
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising that they're trying </v>

3387
02:46:56.631 --> 02:46:58.170
<v Speaker 2>to adapt to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3388
02:46:58.350 --> 02:46:59.183
<v Speaker 2>But it's happening at a really early age</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're giving your kid a </v>

3389
02:47:01.971 --> 02:47:02.804
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not putting any parental filters </v>

3390
02:47:03.921 --> 02:47:04.754
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowing that kid to have full </v>

3391
02:47:05.751 --> 02:47:08.420
<v Speaker 2>access to google and the worldwide web </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're just going to.</v>

3392
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:09.703
<v Speaker 2>If you give your kid to phone and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think they'll know how to use the </v>

3393
02:47:11.451 --> 02:47:13.580
<v Speaker 2>phone better than you within a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fool.</v>

3394
02:47:13.850 --> 02:47:14.683
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3395
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:16.490
<v Speaker 2>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have that thing figured</v>

3396
02:47:16.491 --> 02:47:18.350
<v Speaker 2>out in ways that you haven't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined,</v>

3397
02:47:18.351 --> 02:47:21.410
<v Speaker 2>so you're not controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

3398
02:47:21.610 --> 02:47:22.443
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a very extraordinarily </v>

3399
02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:27.433
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented time to sort of navigate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this world and I don't think any does </v>

3400
02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:35.480
<v Speaker 2>not have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3401
02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:37.970
<v Speaker 2>civilizations have a deal with worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

3402
02:47:37.971 --> 02:47:38.804
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of violence and famine and </v>

3403
02:47:40.370 --> 02:47:41.203
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think anyone's had to deal </v>

3404
02:47:42.981 --> 02:47:47.981
<v Speaker 2>with such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a radically transformative medium.</v>

3405
02:47:48.970 --> 02:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Like this range of possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3406
02:47:51.341 --> 02:47:52.970
<v Speaker 2>and you ain't seen nothing yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3407
02:47:52.971 --> 02:47:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just getting going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

3408
02:47:54.801 --> 02:47:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Have you been watching the boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics videos?</v>

3409
02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys in here.</v>

3410
02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3411
02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:01.693
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the amount of progress they've </v>

3412
02:48:03.561 --> 02:48:05.910
<v Speaker 2>made in five years is just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>staggered,</v>

3413
02:48:05.911 --> 02:48:07.700
<v Speaker 2>but they smell like sulfur and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even know.</v>

3414
02:48:08.270 --> 02:48:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I bet you bringing me in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>

3415
02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:11.293
<v Speaker 2>These guys are doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon musk was on the podcast talking </v>

3416
02:48:13.851 --> 02:48:14.684
<v Speaker 2>about some new development there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work on called neuro link and that this </v>

3417
02:48:18.441 --> 02:48:19.274
<v Speaker 2>is some radical new way of accentuating </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandwidth between human beings and </v>

3418
02:48:23.391 --> 02:48:26.780
<v Speaker 2>information and just increasing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to it.</v>

3419
02:48:26.781 --> 02:48:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And he was very vague about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it was going to come out within,</v>

3420
02:48:30.871 --> 02:48:32.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>x amount of months.</v>

3421
02:48:32.370 --> 02:48:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they've already,</v>

3422
02:48:33.411 --> 02:48:34.244
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are scientists who've already </v>

3423
02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:38.870
<v Speaker 2>managed direct brain to computer links.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3424
02:48:38.871 --> 02:48:40.370
<v Speaker 2>So you can get monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3425
02:48:40.371 --> 02:48:42.470
<v Speaker 2>to move a robotic arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3426
02:48:42.471 --> 02:48:44.250
<v Speaker 2>and I suspect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knoW,</v>

3427
02:48:44.410 --> 02:48:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

3428
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:48.530
<v Speaker 2>you can learn to control single neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your face.</v>

3429
02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:49.693
<v Speaker 2>My suspicions are that we'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop technologies that'll be </v>

3430
02:48:51.891 --> 02:48:54.020
<v Speaker 2>wearable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that won't have to be neural implants,</v>

3431
02:48:54.021 --> 02:48:55.900
<v Speaker 2>that you'll be able to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurally.</v>

3432
02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:59.110
<v Speaker 2>And if that's not very far down the road</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3433
02:48:59.111 --> 02:49:00.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3434
02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:03.170
<v Speaker 2>the probability that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build,</v>

3435
02:49:07.450 --> 02:49:08.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3436
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:08.960
<v Speaker 2>you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3437
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:09.833
<v Speaker 2>what's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kurtzweil his idea of the singularity </v>

3438
02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:15.060
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wild idea and it seems somewhat</v>

3439
02:49:15.061 --> 02:49:17.460
<v Speaker 2>improbable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a friend who once told me that</v>

3440
02:49:18.210 --> 02:49:20.550
<v Speaker 2>if something's impossible then it won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3441
02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:24.060
<v Speaker 2>There'll be something that will come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop it that you won't expect.</v>

3442
02:49:24.061 --> 02:49:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And maybe the singularity is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

3443
02:49:26.101 --> 02:49:27.270
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3444
02:49:27.271 --> 02:49:28.104
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys who were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>high end co computational world and a </v>

3445
02:49:32.101 --> 02:49:34.830
<v Speaker 2>lot of them are convinced that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>within a decade of a machine.</v>

3446
02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:35.664
<v Speaker 2>This is powerful as a human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know people have been saying that </v>

3447
02:49:37.561 --> 02:49:39.480
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but jesus,</v>

3448
02:49:39.481 --> 02:49:40.314
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers are getting good at emotion </v>

3449
02:49:41.761 --> 02:49:42.594
<v Speaker 2>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting really good at facial </v>

3450
02:49:43.981 --> 02:49:46.110
<v Speaker 2>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can communicate with one another,</v>

3451
02:49:46.111 --> 02:49:46.944
<v Speaker 2>they can imitate those boston dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots are pretty damn impressive and </v>

3452
02:49:50.161 --> 02:49:51.420
<v Speaker 2>they're mostly autonomous.</v>

3453
02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:54.510
<v Speaker 2>we've got all sorts of things that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate on their own,</v>

3454
02:49:54.511 --> 02:49:57.180
<v Speaker 2>like these autonomous cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these things are.</v>

3455
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:58.783
<v Speaker 2>They're coming together real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched black mirror on </v>

3456
02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:02.424
<v Speaker 2>netflix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only one I watched was the one that </v>

3457
02:50:04.351 --> 02:50:07.200
<v Speaker 2>outlined what the chinese are now doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their own people.</v>

3458
02:50:07.290 --> 02:50:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crisper.</v>

3459
02:50:09.470 --> 02:50:10.051
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3460
02:50:10.051 --> 02:50:12.610
<v Speaker 2>The one where everything you do is rated</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3461
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:14.500
<v Speaker 2>The social network one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3462
02:50:14.501 --> 02:50:15.130
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3463
02:50:15.130 --> 02:50:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switch,</v>

3464
02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:16.793
<v Speaker 2>which is quite frightening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably probable 100 percent </v>

3465
02:50:20.011 --> 02:50:22.470
<v Speaker 2>probable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the one,</v>

3466
02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:23.633
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called heavy metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about autonomous robots that seek </v>

3467
02:50:26.941 --> 02:50:27.774
<v Speaker 2>out people and kill them and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence people that are </v>

3468
02:50:32.551 --> 02:50:35.730
<v Speaker 2>making these boston dynamic robots and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3469
02:50:35.731 --> 02:50:38.190
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scariest one that I read about was a</v>

3470
02:50:38.191 --> 02:50:41.950
<v Speaker 2>darpa one called the eater robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ea t r.</v>

3471
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It operates on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It uses as a fuel.</v>

3472
02:50:45.950 --> 02:50:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It uses biological material as fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means if you're kidding,</v>

3473
02:50:50.850 --> 02:50:51.661
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3474
02:50:51.661 --> 02:50:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus see a car,</v>

3475
02:50:53.730 --> 02:50:54.563
<v Speaker 2>so this is going to be able to eat dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies in the field theoretically and </v>

3476
02:51:00.871 --> 02:51:02.730
<v Speaker 2>use it as fuel to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3477
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:03.623
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a fine thing to </v>

3478
02:51:04.601 --> 02:51:09.601
<v Speaker 2>develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking imagine an army of robotic armed</v>

3479
02:51:10.650 --> 02:51:13.290
<v Speaker 2>artificially intelligent things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corp cedars,</v>

3480
02:51:13.350 --> 02:51:17.100
<v Speaker 2>eat corpses in order to have fuel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to kill someone's.</v>

3481
02:51:17.101 --> 02:51:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Obviously imagining that it's made and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real thing.</v>

3482
02:51:21.301 --> 02:51:21.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3483
02:51:21.691 --> 02:51:22.524
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that I'm doing what </v>

3484
02:51:24.361 --> 02:51:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing with regards to these lectures</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3485
02:51:26.341 --> 02:51:27.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're in a time of </v>

3486
02:51:27.991 --> 02:51:28.824
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for good and for and for evil and </v>

3487
02:51:33.901 --> 02:51:36.870
<v Speaker 2>that the more people that there are out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who have their acts together,</v>

3488
02:51:36.871 --> 02:51:37.704
<v Speaker 2>the better the probability that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to manage it because </v>

3489
02:51:39.931 --> 02:51:43.080
<v Speaker 2>we've all got some pretty hard decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make coming up real fast,</v>

3490
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these guys that are working on these</v>

3491
02:51:45.301 --> 02:51:46.134
<v Speaker 2>ai systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that the ones that are more </v>

3492
02:51:48.271 --> 02:51:49.104
<v Speaker 2>ethically oriented in a proper direction</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be the ones that have the upper </v>

3493
02:51:51.661 --> 02:51:52.350
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

3494
02:51:52.350 --> 02:51:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm really hoping that so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collectively,</v>

3495
02:51:56.011 --> 02:51:59.370
<v Speaker 2>and what I was looking into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this came up before,</v>

3496
02:51:59.371 --> 02:52:03.990
<v Speaker 2>that it breaks the geneva conventions if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually eat dead bodies,</v>

3497
02:52:04.290 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3498
02:52:06.131 --> 02:52:06.964
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's once we have a robot war dude that </v>

3499
02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:12.280
<v Speaker 2>even conventions out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3500
02:52:12.281 --> 02:52:13.114
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3501
02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree with you more and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I'm personally,</v>

3502
02:52:17.951 --> 02:52:20.770
<v Speaker 2>this is important and collectively it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important that,</v>

3503
02:52:20.771 --> 02:52:21.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just think it's,</v>

3504
02:52:22.570 --> 02:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I think what you wrote 12 rules to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need rules.</v>

3505
02:52:26.681 --> 02:52:30.040
<v Speaker 2>We need rules to be able to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to navigate this thing.</v>

3506
02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That's where I think that the individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis is the right one,</v>

3507
02:52:34.451 --> 02:52:36.310
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm hoping that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3508
02:52:36.311 --> 02:52:39.370
<v Speaker 2>that like every time someone comes up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talks to me and says,</v>

3509
02:52:39.371 --> 02:52:39.850
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3510
02:52:39.850 --> 02:52:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I was in a dark place and I got my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and this is how it's going.</v>

3511
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that tilts the scales non </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivially towards a good outcome and the</v>

3512
02:52:49.241 --> 02:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>more people that that's happening to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3513
02:52:51.370 --> 02:52:52.203
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective way of doing it than to </v>

3514
02:52:53.741 --> 02:52:55.600
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3515
02:52:55.601 --> 02:52:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is either and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening a lot,</v>

3516
02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:58.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3517
02:52:58.161 --> 02:53:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I hear it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear it everyday.</v>

3518
02:53:00.310 --> 02:53:01.143
<v Speaker 2>People that find you and find a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other inspirational people online and </v>

3519
02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:08.620
<v Speaker 2>jocko and there's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many and there's so much fuel</v>

3520
02:53:08.621 --> 02:53:11.260
<v Speaker 2>now for inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much pretty fun that,</v>

3521
02:53:11.530 --> 02:53:14.110
<v Speaker 2>that inspiration could become popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3522
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:16.000
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this company.</v>

3523
02:53:16.010 --> 02:53:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kidding,</v>

3524
02:53:16.750 --> 02:53:18.160
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And encouragement.</v>

3525
02:53:18.161 --> 02:53:18.994
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's quite sad </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how little encouragement people need </v>

3526
02:53:23.081 --> 02:53:24.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's so touching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3527
02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:28.330
<v Speaker 2>because I'm constantly in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being overwhelmed.</v>

3528
02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:29.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with what happened this morning </v>

3529
02:53:29.861 --> 02:53:31.270
<v Speaker 2>when I went to whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3530
02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:34.240
<v Speaker 2>because it's overwhelming to have people</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up and like they share these really</v>

3531
02:53:34.241 --> 02:53:36.820
<v Speaker 2>intimate pieces of their life with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 20 seconds.</v>

3532
02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT's like you're an old friend,</v>

3533
02:53:38.711 --> 02:53:40.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's what my life was like.</v>

3534
02:53:40.931 --> 02:53:41.711
<v Speaker 2>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3535
02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:44.080
<v Speaker 2>it's dark and here's a bunch of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are happening.</v>

3536
02:53:44.081 --> 02:53:44.914
<v Speaker 2>It's like this little blast of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the persona of the person </v>

3537
02:53:48.161 --> 02:53:51.160
<v Speaker 2>disappears and you get to see the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>person there for like 20 seconds.</v>

3538
02:53:51.161 --> 02:53:53.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming,</v>

3539
02:53:53.470 --> 02:53:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but every time that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

3540
02:53:55.751 --> 02:53:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a victory that multiplies to as far</v>

3541
02:53:59.051 --> 02:54:01.000
<v Speaker 2>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hoping that,</v>

3542
02:54:02.350 --> 02:54:04.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every little bit helps,</v>

3543
02:54:04.151 --> 02:54:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly does.</v>

3544
02:54:06.130 --> 02:54:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you meet me and you have one of those</v>

3545
02:54:08.021 --> 02:54:11.230
<v Speaker 2>stories and I don't know how to react,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how it is,</v>

3546
02:54:11.530 --> 02:54:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

3550
02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Genuinely happy for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't know how to react.</v>

3551
02:54:19.391 --> 02:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>That's how to react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3552
02:54:20.770 --> 02:54:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll never will learn how to react,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to react.</v>

3553
02:54:24.251 --> 02:54:25.930
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great man.</v>

3554
02:54:25.931 --> 02:54:26.764
