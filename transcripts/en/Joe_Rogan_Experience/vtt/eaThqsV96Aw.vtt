00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there's a lot of dummies that we'll look at.</v>

3
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Mike Tyson,</v>

4
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I really think that they can kick his ass.</v>

5
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>There are people that look at a guy like you look on stage and they get upset at</v>

6
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you for some reason they get upset at you for getting that attention to get</v>

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so I feel like they should be getting it.</v>

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Thank God every chair,</v>

10
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 2>every time one of them have stepped up.</v>

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a baseball bat of jokes,</v>

12
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

14
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

15
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

16
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

17
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 2>my reaction was always right on,</v>

18
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.891
<v Speaker 2>on time,</v>

19
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 2>laser sharp and they was burnt out of the audience like,</v>

20
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 2>like a cigarette butt and he's been in to witness it and I haven't been in the</v>

21
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:36.511
<v Speaker 2>witness.</v>

22
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.081
<v Speaker 2>You doing it.</v>

23
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I think you're one of the best I've ever seen him do it.</v>

24
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 2>You inspired me and I seen the,</v>

25
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 2>how</v>

26
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you took it out.</v>

27
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.081
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

28
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>well I'm,</v>

29
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I could go much higher.</v>

30
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.423
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

31
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

32
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying,</v>

33
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I see you evaporate.</v>

34
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 2>People says that me.</v>

35
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 2>That told me that it's something that you definitely got to have as part of your</v>

36
00:00:58.481 --> 00:00:58.871
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

37
00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be standing up on the stage talking to people,</v>

38
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to have the ability to,</v>

39
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.223
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

41
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.261
<v Speaker 2>If it comes up,</v>

42
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you've got to shoot them down and keep it moving.</v>

43
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't be haggling with them and you know,</v>

44
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>cause that's going to break the whole continuity of the show up.</v>

45
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>The guys that can just hit him with the hammer and keep it moving</v>

46
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

47
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an unfortunate side effect of comedy,</v>

48
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but we started out freezing.</v>

49
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I were fucking comedy store veterans man and that was a place that nobody</v>

50
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.343
<v Speaker 1>patrolled.</v>

51
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>There was no manager Shush in the room does the comedy store was run by the guy</v>

52
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>on stage and occasionally dude's got kicked out because the comic would go just</v>

53
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>get these fucking people out of here.</v>

54
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it would get,</v>

55
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it would get to the point where it was just you had to kick them out before the</v>

56
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:42.391
<v Speaker 1>show couldn't go on,</v>

57
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>but there was always something there that plays is always drama.</v>

58
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I've had glasses thrown at me on stage there.</v>

59
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.603
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

60
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember when,</v>

61
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Holtzman got knocked out by Martin Lawrence,</v>

63
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.773
<v Speaker 1>his bodyguards.</v>

64
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

65
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>that place was chaos.</v>

66
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

67
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I remember Eddie Griffin,</v>

68
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 3>we were in the main room.</v>

69
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.131
<v Speaker 3>We had a show.</v>

70
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 3>It was Martin Luther King's birthday and after the show,</v>

71
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.401
<v Speaker 3>this was the,</v>

72
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 3>when the Dj came on,</v>

73
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 3>this is the first time I heard this song.</v>

74
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 3>No Vaseline.</v>

75
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:24.351
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

81
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 3>and dre went up on stage and snatched the record off of the,</v>

82
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 3>off the turntable and snapped it in half and that kicked off a riot.</v>

83
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Treach was in there to POC was in their trench.</v>

119
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you fucking videotaped all the time</v>

120
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.391
<v Speaker 2>and that was that.</v>

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 1>How beautiful would that video be</v>

128
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.510
<v Speaker 4>to watch that watch the ass kicking to prior walking on stage to prior talking</v>

130
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.753
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

132
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 1>but just having outside,</v>

133
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I performed with Richard Pryor for a few weeks right at the end.</v>

134
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.563
<v Speaker 1>Right when he was,</v>

135
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>when he stopped performing,</v>

136
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>when he was in a wheelchair member,</v>

137
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>when they used to carry him on the or room.</v>

138
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I had to go on after him for,</v>

139
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.990
<v Speaker 1>for weeks,</v>

140
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.501
<v Speaker 1>for weeks.</v>

141
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:31.981
<v Speaker 1>When he did that,</v>

142
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:32.700

144
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:37.140

145
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.113

<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

147
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you would eat dick like no other time.</v>

148
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

149
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 3>because it wasn't,</v>

150
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.490
<v Speaker 3>it was sad.</v>

151
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It was sad watching Richard know.</v>

152
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.513
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

153
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.570
<v Speaker 3>it was cool because once Richard would open his mouth,</v>

154
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.883
<v Speaker 3>it was him.</v>

155
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

156
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

157
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you could tell that he's,</v>

158
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 3>and then it was,</v>

159
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 3>it was a weird effect because you'd be like,</v>

160
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.311
<v Speaker 3>oh Yo,</v>

161
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:00.031
<v Speaker 3>he's still there.</v>

162
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.380
<v Speaker 3>He's still in there.</v>

163
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 3>But then you'd be like,</v>

164
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

165
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 3>he's in there.</v>

166
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 3>That's his body now.</v>

167
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.441
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he's,</v>

168
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of,</v>

169
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

170
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.140
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like he was more in prison after you heard him do stand up.</v>

171
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Cause it was a realization like this is a man who has his wits but does not have</v>

172
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:19.581
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

173
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:24.581
<v Speaker 3>his motor skills and [inaudible] functions as bodily functions too to match up</v>

174
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 3>with his wit.</v>

175
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

176
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.711
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

177
00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

178
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

179
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.513
<v Speaker 3>that just was,</v>

180
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 3>even though he was funny,</v>

181
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:30.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:31.794
<v Speaker 3>he's sharp.</v>

183
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 3>That just,</v>

184
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.623
<v Speaker 3>it was sad.</v>

185
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

186
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

187
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me like there was a,</v>

188
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>there was a disconnect too towards the end.</v>

189
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

190
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was completely lucid.</v>

191
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So when he would go on stage and talk about things like they didn't always make</v>

192
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:44.161
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

193
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

194
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.451
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

195
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:45.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

197
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

198
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>he was dying,</v>

199
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and he would get this huge round of applause when he got off stage where people</v>

201
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:53.490
<v Speaker 1>just would say,</v>

202
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:53.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.121
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

204
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.050
<v Speaker 1>when you look at him right now,</v>

205
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:55.291
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

206
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>there's not much time left.</v>

207
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is of the greatest comedians.</v>

208
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the greatest comedians ever walked the face of the planet.</v>

209
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

210
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The most influential I think of all time.</v>

211
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And you walk in and watching them as they're carrying him away and then they</v>

212
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>introduce you.</v>

213
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.901
<v Speaker 1>Jeff.</v>

214
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Reggie gets on the piano,</v>

215
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

216
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan from hardball on Fox TV.</v>

217
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Please welcome Joe Rogan.</v>

218
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And you go on stage and you have to do stand up,</v>

219
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>have to Richard.</v>

220
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And it takes at least four or five minutes to get them out of the room cause</v>

221
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>they're walking with them out of the room they have,</v>

222
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>cause he can't really walk.</v>

223
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So they have to carry him and walk with them really slowly.</v>

224
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's clapping and standing.</v>

225
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

226
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>like a war veteran just got off stage.</v>

227
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.073
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

228
