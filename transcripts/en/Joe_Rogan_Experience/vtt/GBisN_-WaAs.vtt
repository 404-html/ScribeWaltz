00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:43.591
<v Speaker 1>It was a Cuban guy,</v>

74
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>looked like separate goal,</v>

75
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but he would come in and break the Cubans balls.</v>

76
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>He went after Cubans.</v>

77
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't have to Cubans in 76 and 75.</v>

78
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to run heavy and he would come into my mother's bar in Salta</v>

79
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>and fuck you motherfuckers,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did Julio Cesar Chavez when he fought Meldrick Taylor,</v>

137
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no question about that fight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Meldrick Taylor got a spirit taking.</v>

139
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Chavez took his spirit.</v>

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 2>He hurt them bad to physically,</v>

141
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>like he was never the same physically,</v>

142
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>but he was also number the same psychologically to go through that crazy ass war</v>

143
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>and to be boxing the fucking ears off the guy at first.</v>

144
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Then eventually the guy just slowly wears you down,</v>

145
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 2>slowly wears you down,</v>

146
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>and then boom stops you in the twelfth with like seconds to go.</v>

147
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>They stopped the fight.</v>

148
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a crushing blow,</v>

149
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>a devastating blow,</v>

150
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a to to have the referee look at you when there's like,</v>

152
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>was it like two seconds left on the clock and the referees shakes him off.</v>

153
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.980

<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

156
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>That's like a spirit crusher.</v>

157
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>talking about the spirit with Jose Torres.</v>

159
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So we were kids and once a month this lady would pass a fucking spirit in the</v>

160
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:21.234
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

161
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 1>She would go.</v>

162
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>She was on mom.</v>

163
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

164
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.050
<v Speaker 1>this lady was a mom.</v>

165
00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:24.884
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch her.</v>

166
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.151
<v Speaker 1>She was a mom.</v>

167
00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 1>She used to drive her kids around to different basketball games and shit.</v>

168
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Her husband and her was separated.</v>

169
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.210
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't a boozer.</v>

170
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>She never really cursed.</v>

171
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I would go with in the daytime and she would make sandwiches for you and stuff</v>

172
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:37.334
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

173
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>She would take the kids to church on Sundays,</v>

174
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.190
<v Speaker 1>so I used to watch it,</v>

175
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but my mother once told me that said that lady passes a fucking weird spirit</v>

176
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.810
<v Speaker 1>once a month or some shit and people go over there and you bring them money or</v>

177
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>gifts or whatever the fuck you bring in and she talks to you show one night.</v>

178
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Speaker 1>We wasn't to him with the spirit.</v>

179
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So one night we went over there.</v>

180
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Now how long have you known me?</v>

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.660

188
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 1>This is fucked up but I'm going to tell you I'm about eight or nine.</v>

189
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So this one.</v>

190
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Last time I went to the bar and he had them all up at the ball.</v>

191
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Like Popeye Doyle had those people in fucking,</v>

192
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>the French connection memory when he goes in and he says,</v>

194
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.371
<v Speaker 1>everybody against the wall,</v>

195
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:22.640
<v Speaker 1>this is the last time I went in there and now he's fucking Cuban's pitch.</v>

196
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's pissed.</v>

197
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 1>So like we got to figure something out.</v>

198
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And I knew eventually my dad was going to shoot this guy.</v>

199
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

200
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I just had a funny feeling and my Stepdad or some of these on the shoot this</v>

201
00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy because he was going over his bounds.</v>

202
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 1>They felt that he was abusing Cubans,</v>

203
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>which is even worse when you're Cuban.</v>

204
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>If he was a white dude or a black dude,</v>

205
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:40.401
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

206
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the turf.</v>

207
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking Cuban.</v>

208
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.730

209
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.670
<v Speaker 1>So I knew about this and I just turned the other way.</v>

210
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 1>One night we go to this lady's house and she's talking to these people and she's</v>

211
00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:51.794
<v Speaker 1>got the spirit.</v>

212
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm wanting to sleep.</v>

213
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>This lady would drink fucking rule alcohol.</v>

214
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.054

218
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.013

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

221
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>She was supposed to be a black African fucking slave,</v>

222
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but she was really a Puerto Rican woman and she plucked it and drink the fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was a little fucking kid.</v>

225
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Doug and I remember looking at his shit in my pants off and she took a dish and</v>

227
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>she took the dishes.</v>

228
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>She put the candle under the dish.</v>

229
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.191
<v Speaker 1>She took the candle,</v>

230
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>she drew it down.</v>

231
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>She showed the dish to my mother.</v>

232
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

233

235
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It just looked like some candle designer the thing,</v>

236
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

237
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.043
<v Speaker 1>She took the dish,</v>

238
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.801
<v Speaker 1>she smashed it.</v>

239
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:40.460

298
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:04.040

<v Speaker 1>How much or how many of the cops were in on it back then?</v>

307
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.113
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

308
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.633
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

309
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>New York was a different.</v>

310
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>New York was a different fucking animal then,</v>

311
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but you got to remember that it was just a taxi.</v>

312
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thought about that when New York back then.</v>

313
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>That was 20 years ahead of that fucking time.</v>

314
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

315
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>when New York's needs,</v>

316
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:33.201
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>

317
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>everybody else caught a fucking cold.</v>

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's get down to that 10 years behind over here and he's fucking savages.</v>

319
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

320
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a totally different place socially than New York,</v>

321
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.523
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

322
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

323
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>You think people are more on the ball there?</v>

324
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>There's more like there's more con artists and shit.</v>

325
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.560
<v Speaker 1>There's more clever people did anything that's more fucking Douche bags</v>

326
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.403
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:14.550
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about that like really intense fast and,</v>

434
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.590
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>

435
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 2>your voice gets really tired because I had to drink a lot of tea so I could not</v>

436
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 2>hold in my urine.</v>

437
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So what you were saying before I left so rudely is that your dog's a whore,</v>

438
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.451
<v Speaker 2>a whore,</v>

439
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that lesbians are raping your daughter.</v>

440
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.320
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

441
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

442
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:28.161
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

443
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:33.161
<v Speaker 3>And like why do all dogs have just the intuition to get on top of another dog</v>

444
00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:35.630
<v Speaker 3>and Hump it even if they don't have a dick?</v>

445
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Because it doesn't make sense.</v>

446
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

447
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

448
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 2>My dog used to do that.</v>

449
00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:42.230
<v Speaker 2>She was a female pit bull and I had a male pit bull that was a puppy and she</v>

450
00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 2>used to get on top of them and hump them just like rubbing pussies and no,</v>

451
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:45.111
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

452
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a dominant thing.</v>

453
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 2>So what she's doing is saying that if I wanted to fuck you in the ass,</v>

454
00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:49.551
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

455
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I can get to the position where I'm on top of you.</v>

456
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm stronger than you.</v>

457
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Like they jockey for position.</v>

458
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You have to almost like it's,</v>

459
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.211
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

460
00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:57.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a social thing.</v>

461
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like for a dog to be able to get on top of you and dry hump you.</v>

462
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that he's Horny,</v>

463
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.970
<v Speaker 2>it's also that he's trying to let you know he can do that.</v>

464
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.680
<v Speaker 2>He can impose himself on you.</v>

465
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Like my two dogs,</v>

466
00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 2>they have very clear rules like Johnny's a mastiff,</v>

467
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.920
<v Speaker 2>he's a big fucking dog and you know,</v>

468
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.620
<v Speaker 2>he's got this giant fucking head and he's a sweetheart of a dog,</v>

469
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.760
<v Speaker 2>but the other dogs,</v>

470
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:17.461
<v Speaker 2>a bull dog,</v>

471
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Shiba inu banks and the other dog doesn't get no say and shit.</v>

472
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.411
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it is.</v>

473
00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:22.244
<v Speaker 2>They don't fight,</v>

474
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't argue,</v>

475
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.290
<v Speaker 2>but when I opened up the door,</v>

476
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.550
<v Speaker 2>johnny walks in first.</v>

477
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.443
<v Speaker 2>Every time,</v>

478
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.780
<v Speaker 2>every time the other dog will stop and let Johnny go through first.</v>

479
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

480
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Because Johnny a 140 pound master,</v>

481
00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:33.380
<v Speaker 2>if he's fucking huge,</v>

482
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:35.360
<v Speaker 2>so there's just clear rules.</v>

484
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.190
<v Speaker 2>If Johnny wanted to hunt Brutus,</v>

485
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.120
<v Speaker 2>he could get away with it,</v>

486
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 2>but it brutus tried to Hump Johnny.</v>

487
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:41.270
<v Speaker 2>There would be chaos.</v>

488
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.231
<v Speaker 2>It would be like,</v>

489
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

490
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist probably would growl and snap at Johnny.</v>

491
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.701
<v Speaker 2>Johnny tried to Hump Them,</v>

492
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but the point is the other way is absolutely preposterous.</v>

493
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to happen.</v>

494
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:52.490
<v Speaker 2>There's like a this with animals,</v>

495
00:13:52.491 --> 00:13:56.600
<v Speaker 2>there's an Alpha and then there's the ones who give in to the Alpha and your dog</v>

496
00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:59.660
<v Speaker 2>clearly is like the most Beta dog ever.</v>

497
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.001
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

498
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:02.390
<v Speaker 2>It's so much dog food and we gave her.</v>

499
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is dog?</v>

500
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the way it works is that they just feel her submissiveness and they</v>

501
00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:10.640
<v Speaker 2>want a mount her.</v>

502
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Their instinct is to mount her and dominator.</v>

503
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

504
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.120
<v Speaker 3>the old dog I used to have was always a bad dog and every time it was bad I</v>

505
00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:20.600
<v Speaker 3>would just like kind of put her in between my legs and my arm and kind of</v>

506
00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 3>getting like a crouching position and kind of just like put her in between me</v>

507
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:25.094
<v Speaker 3>and like hold her.</v>

508
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.030
<v Speaker 3>And so I was kind of like on top of her,</v>

509
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.140
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like fucking earnings,</v>

510
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.290
<v Speaker 3>she was just like on like underneath my belly,</v>

512
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.000
<v Speaker 3>like a little cave I would make.</v>

513
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I would just sit there for like 10 minutes and you can tell the dog at first</v>

514
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.773
<v Speaker 3>trying to get out.</v>

515
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.570
<v Speaker 3>And then finally just kind of some this are,</v>

516
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

517
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.540
<v Speaker 3>just kind of lays down and it gives up.</v>

518
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Dog is just fine,</v>

519
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.103
<v Speaker 3>just walks around.</v>

521
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're supposed to do that.</v>

522
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I think you fucked up your dog's head,</v>

523
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 2>raped your dog.</v>

524
00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Every time it shit on carpet and every time it sits in the car,</v>

525
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:53.350
<v Speaker 2>but you rate it.</v>

526
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.681
<v Speaker 3>Well No,</v>

527
00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:53.880
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

528
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.590
<v Speaker 3>It's something I learned kind of from a Caesar.</v>

529
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Caesar does he?</v>

530
00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.733
<v Speaker 3>After showtime,</v>

531
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.421
<v Speaker 3>after nights,</v>

532
00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:02.440
<v Speaker 3>showtime version of it.</v>

533
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Now he,</v>

534
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.311
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

535
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:04.330
<v Speaker 3>he says secret.</v>

536
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

537
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.190
<v Speaker 3>probably be the best way to do it.</v>

538
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:06.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

539
00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:06.701
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

540
00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 3>well he didn't say it like that.</v>

541
00:15:07.631 --> 00:15:10.810
<v Speaker 3>He said that you should grab it by the back of the neck and like hold it down</v>

542
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 3>for awhile,</v>

543
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.240
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty much what I was doing.</v>

544
00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty much getting on top of it and just kind of like getting like,</v>

545
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

546
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I am the master here.</v>

547
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole dog thing is crazy man.</v>

548
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you have these animals that listened to you right now?</v>

549
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

550
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.970
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with us?</v>

551
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.790
<v Speaker 2>There's not another animal that keeps animals that they love.</v>

552
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

553
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.690
<v Speaker 2>it's weird and we've got an engineered to be like the sweetest,</v>

554
00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:32.890
<v Speaker 2>nicest things ever.</v>

555
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

556
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:33.940
<v Speaker 2>look at your dog.</v>

557
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Your dog's ridiculously affectionate.</v>

558
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a dog but not just affectionate,</v>

559
00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:40.510
<v Speaker 2>but she's so needy to her.</v>

560
00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like every breath,</v>

561
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but like taking a breath.</v>

562
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 2>She needs that much attention.</v>

563
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like as much as she's breathing,</v>

564
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.440
<v Speaker 2>she someone touching her as much as she needs to take him there.</v>

565
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.680
<v Speaker 2>She needs someone to touch her.</v>

566
00:15:50.681 --> 00:15:51.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like that extreme,</v>

567
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

568
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.970
<v Speaker 3>A stripper or something way worse.</v>

569
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Way Worse since does.</v>

570
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Is there any animal that has pubic hair?</v>

571
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.690
<v Speaker 3>I've never taken the other day.</v>

572
00:16:00.691 --> 00:16:01.290
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

573
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.700
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be cool if animals have pubic hairs and like term or you could just</v>

574
00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:06.750
<v Speaker 3>get a full Bush,</v>

575
00:16:06.751 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

576
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.773
<v Speaker 3>like if you're it,</v>

577
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.080
<v Speaker 3>the animal would have to have nothing else around it.</v>

578
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have pubic hair over their whole fucking body.</v>

579
00:16:12.391 --> 00:16:13.440
<v Speaker 3>That's basically what's going on.</v>

580
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

581
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.820
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

582
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.300
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

583
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.751
<v Speaker 3>But I mean like,</v>

584
00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:17.070
<v Speaker 3>like even like bald eagles,</v>

585
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.701
<v Speaker 3>Bald Eagles,</v>

586
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:18.390
<v Speaker 3>that bushes.</v>

587
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Those are feathers.</v>

588
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:19.830
<v Speaker 3>But I mean like,</v>

589
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.670
<v Speaker 3>why don't they have.</v>

590
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about Bald Eagles have penises,</v>

591
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:23.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

592
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

593
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Why are humans the only ones that have a pubic hairs?</v>

594
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't have hair on the rest of our body.</v>

595
00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:32.280
<v Speaker 2>There's very few animals that have exposed very few animals that have exposed</v>

596
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

597
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.191
<v Speaker 2>That ain't shit.</v>

598
00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

599
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.450
<v Speaker 2>If you were a viewer,</v>

600
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.140
<v Speaker 2>a coyote,</v>

601
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I would take him to the vet.</v>

602
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I believe this poor thing is dying because all his hair is missing.</v>

603
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.980
<v Speaker 2>When you think is Harry is only Harry to a hairless person.</v>

604
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 2>You know I'm covered in here too.</v>

605
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not Harry is.</v>

606
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.980
<v Speaker 2>That's your hairless.</v>

607
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>

608
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.040
<v Speaker 2>You have a little hair compared to the other healers folks.</v>

609
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Why don't monkeys have huge bushes?</v>

610
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.743
<v Speaker 2>They do ban.</v>

611
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

612
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.423
<v Speaker 2>They have pubic hairs.</v>

613
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.330
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

614
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't get long and crazy like ours because they just have different kinds of</v>

615
00:16:57.881 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

616
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but they have hair around their dick and balls.</v>

617
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is wrong with you son.</v>

618
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.560
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do some research before you come up with these crazy pubic hair</v>

619
00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>

620
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

621
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't have bushes like talking about the biggest.</v>

622
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't have it anywhere else.</v>

623
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.800
<v Speaker 2>It would be weird if like animals,</v>

624
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.993
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

625
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no the only animal that's like us that his hair and certain parts</v>

626
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:22.860
<v Speaker 2>of his body is like some some dogs and I just wish all men.</v>

627
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Why don't give a fuck about animal pubic?</v>

628
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.310
<v Speaker 2>It'd be all worried about people dying of radiation poisoning and Japan and</v>

629
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

630
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Why are we in Libya?</v>

631
00:17:30.911 --> 00:17:31.960
<v Speaker 2>The CIA's involvement,</v>

632
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:32.500
<v Speaker 2>our life.</v>

633
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about animals</v>

634
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 3>think Peter would exist if animals have hairs.</v>

635
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Ryan,</v>

636
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>don't let me get built</v>

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm straight.</v>

640
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>My voice is too big.</v>

641
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I blow the speakers might be called dog.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

643
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

644
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.470
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in the pilborough did a video where a,</v>

645
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 2>he fucking talked about the thing that is a video on youtube.</v>

646
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 2>So he made it six minutes long.</v>

647
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 2>He talked about the argument on his own for another six minutes and at the end</v>

648
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.161
<v Speaker 2>of it he goes,</v>

649

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

650
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.323
<v Speaker 2>And I was right.</v>

651
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.343
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>

652
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.183
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

653

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.290
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know about computers and they're trying to rip you off and take the</v>

655
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 2>money for the artists.</v>

656
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 2>They never had money for the artist fucking rss feeds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but fuck that,</v>

691
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.461
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

692
00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:15.590
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty baked when that argument happened,</v>

693
00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:19.790
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that bugged me the most about everything was my whole thing wasn't</v>

694
00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:20.390
<v Speaker 3>that I'm like,</v>

695
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.631
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

696
00:19:20.631 --> 00:19:22.850
<v Speaker 3>what stitchers doing is 100 percent legal.</v>

697
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

698
00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:23.630
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

699
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.220
<v Speaker 3>What I was saying is if you have something on your website that you put on your</v>

700
00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 3>website that is only put on your website,</v>

701
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.290
<v Speaker 3>if you want to broadcast to your stuff,</v>

702
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.310
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want that,</v>

703
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>then take it off your website.</v>

704
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:36.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't change anything.</v>

705
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.360
<v Speaker 3>My whole argument is like,</v>

706
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.520
<v Speaker 3>why do you have an rss feed on your website?</v>

707
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

708
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.470
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

709
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.740
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

710
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Why did you put it on?</v>

711
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Are we really having this conversation?</v>

712
00:19:45.441 --> 00:19:46.274
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

713
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.491
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

714
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:48.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm already so my art,</v>

715
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.970
<v Speaker 3>but my argument that I'm just saying,</v>

716
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.610
<v Speaker 3>know your argument was brought it up.</v>

717
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.683
<v Speaker 3>Here we go again.</v>

718
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

719
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:54.921
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

720
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:55.011
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

721
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:55.671
<v Speaker 2>His argument is,</v>

722
00:19:55.671 --> 00:19:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I know what your argument is.</v>

723
00:19:56.601 --> 00:20:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware of the general details of the disagreement.</v>

724
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.531
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

725
00:20:00.531 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 3>but how?</v>

726
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 3>How is how is what I'm saying is that's not a wrong or right thing.</v>

727
00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:05.470
<v Speaker 3>That's just a question now</v>

728
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.800
<v Speaker 2>actually anymore.</v>

729
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't care anymore.</v>

730
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:10.450
<v Speaker 2>What's way more fascinating to me is how involved you to gut.</v>

731
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.560
<v Speaker 2>That was way more fun.</v>

732
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>

733
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.340
<v Speaker 3>When you're getting a tax issues,</v>

734
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>trying to explain to somebody</v>

735
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.420
<v Speaker 2>the actual issue was minuscule compared to how psychologically captivating it</v>

736
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Speaker 2>was and how he was genuinely getting upset and you were getting upset too and I</v>

737
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.890
<v Speaker 2>was trying to mediate because I generally did see both sides.</v>

738
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely did,</v>

739
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but what I couldn't understand is how you guys are getting so God damn upset and</v>

740
00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:32.560
<v Speaker 2>then when I would bring it up building it.</v>

741
00:20:32.561 --> 00:20:32.771
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

742
00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:37.400
<v Speaker 2>this is the fucking new spa Joe Rogan Joe Rogan from 1994 with a fucking stab</v>

743
00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:38.320
<v Speaker 2>somebody by now.</v>

744
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.930
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even know each other back then.</v>

745
00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

746
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.390
<v Speaker 2>You're just assuming you're assuming I would have done that.</v>

747
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:43.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

748
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 3>you know what it was just to me it was like I've already said the same five</v>

749
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

750
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.161
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

751
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:50.740
<v Speaker 3>I can't say anything else about that.</v>

752
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.020
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get you guys to stop.</v>

753
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.893
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating.</v>

754
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.581
<v Speaker 2>You would like to.</v>

755
00:20:53.581 --> 00:20:54.414
<v Speaker 2>Dogs Bark like,</v>

756
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

757
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.531
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>

758
00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

759
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.503
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>

760
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Starting there also comes to a point where you are like,</v>

761
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Speaker 3>feel like you're talking to your mom doing email.</v>

762
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 3>That's how I get about certain things.</v>

763
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 3>You must have saw his point a little bit.</v>

764
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.211
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

765
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I see what he's saying,</v>

766
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what I'm saying.</v>

767
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I agree with him or disagree with them on that.</v>

768
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't willing to listen to what you were saying about the whole concept of</v>

769
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 3>an rss feed,</v>

770
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.740
<v Speaker 3>which stands for really simple syndication and what syndication mean.</v>

771
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:23.720
<v Speaker 3>You want to syndicate.</v>

772
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

773
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.330
<v Speaker 3>What's that mean?</v>

774
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.010
<v Speaker 3>It's you want to spread it out to as many people as possible.</v>

775
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely available on your website.</v>

776
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>

777
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.810
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem was the real problem is itunes numbers and that's what he</v>

778
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Speaker 3>really wants to say is that sticker was helping hurting his items,</v>

779
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.160
<v Speaker 3>numbers and probably that he doesn't know what an rss feed is,</v>

780
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 3>why it's on his website.</v>

781
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 3>If he wants people to go to his website,</v>

782
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 3>take off your rss feed,</v>

783
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.943
<v Speaker 3>that's all you have to do.</v>

784
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.371
<v Speaker 3>Make.</v>

785
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Don't make your rss feed public.</v>

786
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Just give it to Itunes,</v>

787
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.780
<v Speaker 3>only hide your rss feed and then everyone will come to your website and you'll</v>

788
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.481
<v Speaker 3>have your items.</v>

789
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Only one.</v>

790
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.110
<v Speaker 2>We do one better than that.</v>

791
00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:57.960
<v Speaker 2>We allow people to download it and not just on Stitcher,</v>

792
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.090
<v Speaker 2>but allow people to download it directly,</v>

793
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>so the moment it goes live,</v>

794
00:22:02.161 --> 00:22:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I have a download link so I don't want.</v>

795
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:07.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to wait till somebody itunes numbers will be higher.</v>

796
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Like to me all that matters is that you get it out there,</v>

797
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.560
<v Speaker 2>you don't get cookies for being number three or number four or you know,</v>

798
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.251
<v Speaker 2>it's cute.</v>

799
00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:15.390
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to see the number,</v>

800
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.600
<v Speaker 2>but what's important to me is just that it gets distributed to as many people as</v>

801
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:20.280
<v Speaker 2>possible as easily as possible.</v>

802
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't like fucking with itunes.</v>

803
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes who love the Zune.</v>

804
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.440
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

805
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I heard the New Zealand is pretty bad ass.</v>

806
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I think they stopped making them bro.</v>

807
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

808
00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:27.630
<v Speaker 3>did they?</v>

809
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

810
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I lied on my ass.</v>

811
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some people</v>

812
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that have just little MP.</v>

813
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Three players was a little flash MP.</v>

814
00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Three players were like a little.</v>

815
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.001
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

816
00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like he got to have it available for everything in anybody.</v>

817
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 3>No voids,</v>

818
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.340
<v Speaker 3>and especially when it's.</v>

819
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 3>If it's a free thing that you just want to get out your podcast to people,</v>

820
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:44.771
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

821
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:44.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

822
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:45.340
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

823
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing like Doug Benson where you're charging money.</v>

824
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to get your body just calling out Doug Benson.</v>

825
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:52.170
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe the fee.</v>

826
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 3>The honest thing is the future of podcasts,</v>

827
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 3>how our podcasts is going to make money.</v>

828
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 3>What Doug is doing is pretty interesting.</v>

829
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 3>He's charging money now for like certain shows.</v>

830
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's every shoe.</v>

831
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like he has like certain shows.</v>

832
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Marin does that too.</v>

833
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like something where you become like some super members on shit.</v>

834
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

835
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

836
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I honestly think the only way really to make money and to get sponsors got to</v>

837
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>get a lot a lot of listeners and get sponsors.</v>

838
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to do it,</v>

839
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

840
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

841
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I think because I think we've just reached this time on the Internet.</v>

842
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 3>We have to look at the music industry and we have to say,</v>

843
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.011
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

844
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 3>the music industry has changed.</v>

845
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not that people started stealing and taking shit from,</v>

846
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>from the music industry.</v>

847
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Is that happened and that there was no way to stop that,</v>

848
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 3>so the music industry has to reorganize,</v>

849
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 3>refigure out how they do it and that's going to happen with everything and you</v>

850
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 3>can't fucking stop it.</v>

851
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta go with what you think is going to happen and that's like</v>

852
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:42.041
<v Speaker 3>podcasting.</v>

853
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what's happening with podcasting,</v>

854
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>but you have to pretty much go with what you can do</v>

855
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

856
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll try to have the luxury thing.</v>

857
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 1>We also have the luxury of doing other things,</v>

858
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I have the luxury of not having to rely completely on my podcast with the UFC</v>

860
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 1>and we're doing standup especially with doing standup because the podcast</v>

957
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

958
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:14.391
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

959
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:16.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of his songs and I just then</v>

960
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 1>he was experimenting with everything but they were still stuck in this bucket</v>

961
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:24.980
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

962
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:25.610

966
00:26:29.531 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 1>some of them didn't come out and some of them is very self indulgent so his</v>

967
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:33.840
<v Speaker 1>style is,</v>

968
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it gets caught up and what he's doing,</v>

970
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:37.070
<v Speaker 1>but when he hit it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was my.</v>

979
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 1>During high school there was a,</v>

980
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to get that as our high school senior song,</v>

981
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.683
<v Speaker 1>erotic city.</v>

982
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

983
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.190

00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 1>so we were all trying to like organize it and then someone listened to it.</v>

986
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Someone who worked for the school as it do it.</v>

987
00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.860
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of that.</v>

988
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Do Do.</v>

989
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.270

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 1>He's done some great shit and that's what's really going on.</v>

992
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's got to have gone.</v>

993
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing that somebody told me this two years ago and I really</v>

994
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 1>experienced that last year in Irvine.</v>

995
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Last year was when I see the fruition of what you've been doing.</v>

996
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me that now because of the Internet,</v>

997
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>twitter and all the podcasts and people want the full experience and I didn't</v>

998
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>really see it to last July.</v>

999
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.040
<v Speaker 1>If you noticed last July when I changed everything about my twitter,</v>

1000
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 1>my facebook,</v>

1001
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I changed everything about it because they paid more attention to it.</v>

1002
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 1>How come I understand now where you're coming from?</v>

1003
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.461
<v Speaker 1>There's no more.</v>

1004
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I see what Ralphie may's doing.</v>

1005
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing with these.</v>

1007
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a waste of time.</v>

1008
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:51.960
<v Speaker 1>That's all that you're staying at home.</v>

1009
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.033
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do.</v>

1010
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>The thing about this game is to to make the most money for the least amount of</v>

1011
00:27:57.121 --> 00:27:57.331
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1012

<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't like that.</v>

1013
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.061
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that.</v>

1014
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not that with as many people as you can,</v>

1015
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:03.301
<v Speaker 1>but you have a wife,</v>

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.111
<v Speaker 1>I would never do it,</v>

1022
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but I will look what you do with a blink of a fucking button.</v>

1023
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.980

1030
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.380

<v Speaker 1>free show or a show and then your situation,</v>

00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 2>being potheads being like unambitious and Lazy Sativa makes me way more</v>

1288
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 2>ambitious.</v>

1289
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.960
<v Speaker 2>It makes me aware of the consequences of not working as hard as you can and how</v>

1290
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:18.794
<v Speaker 2>you feel.</v>

1291
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.950
<v Speaker 2>It makes me super sensitive to my own actions,</v>

1292
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 2>positive or negative.</v>

1293
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So it makes me super sensitive to doing things that I should be doing as far as</v>

1294
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:28.490
<v Speaker 2>like getting work done as far as like,</v>

1295
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:28.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:30.740
<v Speaker 2>writing and performing and you know,</v>

1297
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.111
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1298
00:35:31.111 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 2>and doing podcasts and it,</v>

1299
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever cancel podcast man,</v>

1300
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.100
<v Speaker 2>after I'd have to be sick as fuck and I don't get sick very often.</v>

1302
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.940
<v Speaker 2>So we do.</v>

1303
00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1304
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like Sativa makes me hyper aware when I'm hyper aware I'm,</v>

1306
00:35:43.091 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm more diligent,</v>

1307
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1308
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think it makes me more ambitious.</v>

1309
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.140
<v Speaker 3>But do you guys think if you had,</v>

1310
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.880
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to take a month off,</v>

1311
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.410
<v Speaker 3>do you think you could possibly easily do it?</v>

1312
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:51.801
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

1313
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I've done that and I haven't taken a month off,</v>

1314
00:35:53.961 --> 00:35:55.010
<v Speaker 2>but I've taken weeks off.</v>

1315
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I can take a couple of days off.</v>

1316
00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.430
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>

1317
00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Just to see what does this fear factor.</v>

1318
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.731
<v Speaker 2>Here's the perfect.</v>

1319
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:03.231
<v Speaker 2>I've tried.</v>

1320
00:36:03.231 --> 00:36:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about it.</v>

1321
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 3>You smoke a shitload of weed.</v>

1322
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 3>You have to be spending a shit</v>

1323
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.303
<v Speaker 2>load of.</v>

1324
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I smoke a shitload of weed in the people around me smoke a shitload dog.</v>

1325
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird that the people around me are into it,</v>

1326
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:15.781
<v Speaker 2>like I'm into it,</v>

1327
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:19.410
<v Speaker 2>like the type people we all have fun together and when people don't understand</v>

1328
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana is that they think it's some sort of an escape.</v>

1329
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's an enhancement.</v>

1330
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not an escape.</v>

1331
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:26.850
<v Speaker 2>We're living in the same world you're living in,</v>

1332
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 2>ma'am.</v>

1333
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just more fun when you're high.</v>

1334
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:31.590
<v Speaker 2>It's really that simple and it's not ruining your body.</v>

1335
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>

1336
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Pepper on your steak for tate.</v>

1337
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Tate.</v>

1338
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:36.931
<v Speaker 2>Can't smoke weed.</v>

1339
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1340
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 2>standing up doesn't like weed.</v>

1341
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of our friends don't like weed.</v>

1342
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good man.</v>

1343
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

1344
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1345
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been smoking weed so much that I could take a couple of days off.</v>

1346
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 3>I could take probably a week.</v>

1347
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I've probably taken a week off recently,</v>

1348
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1349
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.481
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1350
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:52.830
<v Speaker 3>the idea of taking a month off,</v>

1351
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 3>it's so foreign to me.</v>

1352
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I almost want to do it just to see what happens.</v>

1353
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I must blog about it.</v>

1354
00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.290
<v Speaker 1>She'd become a Republican.</v>

1355
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.540
<v Speaker 1>He started watching bill o'reilly.</v>

1356
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1357
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.551
<v Speaker 1>It was right.</v>

1358
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>We do have to be afraid of Mexican.</v>

1359
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I haven't stopped smoking weed since 14,</v>

1360
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 1>15 to a point in my life,</v>

1361
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.270
<v Speaker 1>my career,</v>

1362
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't write anymore.</v>

1363
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 1>When I get really high.</v>

1364
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1365
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:13.861
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1366
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:13.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1367
00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:14.671
<v Speaker 1>I get up in the morning,</v>

1368
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:15.211
<v Speaker 1>I get high.</v>

1369
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:19.230
<v Speaker 1>It's to go on twitter and facebook and make adjustments here and get my day</v>

1370
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:20.064
<v Speaker 1>ready.</v>

1371
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.280
<v Speaker 1>But like now when I write I try to be a little straighter.</v>

1372
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Really what I work out.</v>

1373
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I got a blaze dog.</v>

1374
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If I get good at it.</v>

1375
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I had a book I got to get an edible.</v>

1376
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I love working out stumped.</v>

1377
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That is my life.</v>

1378
00:37:32.431 --> 00:37:34.340
<v Speaker 1>That was how I did 30 years ago.</v>

1379
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I love not remembering what set it is and I know my shoulders on fire.</v>

1380
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.931
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1381
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that if I get.</v>

1382
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 1>If I don't get high,</v>

1383
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I still work out an hour and I still do a good job,</v>

1384
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:46.621
<v Speaker 1>but if I work,</v>

1385
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:47.341
<v Speaker 1>if I get high,</v>

1386
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll work out an our 40 and it's just a little tighter.</v>

1387
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I concentrate on my kicks.</v>

1388
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I concentrate on the form.</v>

1389
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1390
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.773
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

1391
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.733
<v Speaker 1>Do everything.</v>

1392
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.100
<v Speaker 2>When I kicked the bag of them high,</v>

1393
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 2>usually I don't usually I kicked the whole holding the bag by mistake.</v>

1394
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:02.514
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

1395
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I left Brown House with the fucking ankle,</v>

1396
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 2>but I like getting on the bike stones because think about it.</v>

1397
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I liked the elliptical stone is a fucking different world.</v>

1398
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.870
<v Speaker 2>You know how many people were all stoned Jujitsu or you have to.</v>

1399
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does.</v>

1400
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:19.021
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1401
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:19.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1402
00:38:19.091 --> 00:38:19.330
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1403
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

1404
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.770
<v Speaker 2>these classes and these classes,</v>

1405
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.700
<v Speaker 2>like you walk in that room,</v>

1406
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you smell refer you.</v>

1407
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Some everyone smells like refer.</v>

1408
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>This is like half of his fucking students are high as fuck.</v>

1409
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:28.494
<v Speaker 2>When they take you</v>

1410
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 1>a piece of banana cake and you go to yoga.</v>

1411
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1412
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>But you that that's Mckenna</v>

1413
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 1>used to say that that's what yoga was invented for.</v>

1414
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Yoga was an advance before was maximizing cannabis.</v>

1415
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It was you.</v>

1416
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.530
<v Speaker 1>People would be eating cannabis and when they were eating it they realized how</v>

1417
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 1>good it felt when you hold your body in certain positions.</v>

1418
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>So they came up with this like connection to spirituality through eating</v>

1419
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 1>cannabis and holding these poses.</v>

1420
00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:59.180
<v Speaker 1>These difficult political.</v>

1421
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1422
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.701
<v Speaker 1>because something.</v>

1423
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about the energy of the pose that makes you go into some</v>

1424
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 1>some state when you're high as fuck,</v>

1425
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but it really does.</v>

1426
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Even if when you're sober,</v>

1427
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:08.081
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1428
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I've done yoga sober and after it's over,</v>

1429
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I felt high.</v>

1430
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.853
<v Speaker 1>Well the breathing,</v>

1431
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the breathing,</v>

1432
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>intense breathing that's going through your body and focusing so much on the</v>

1433
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

1434
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 1>When I go in and ate a little piece of banana bread because it's 8:30 in the</v>

1435
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:21.090
<v Speaker 1>morning when I got to go to your.</v>

1436
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So I gotta start blazing 7:30 by the time.</v>

1437
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take for banana bread or hit you?</v>

1438
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes.</v>

1439
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes to five minutes and I kick it a little Jaffa,</v>

1440
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>

1441
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 1>to get everything going.</v>

1442
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to do other than downward dog.</v>

1443
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I've been fucking pigeons.</v>

1444
00:39:36.201 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been fun and it's.</v>

1445
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's you thinking about your breathing is so beautiful.</v>

1446
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.674
<v Speaker 1>When you're high,</v>

1447
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go into the water and you have like.</v>

1448
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And you could hear your breath like right now.</v>

1449
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.153
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1450
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1451
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 1>When you do yoga,</v>

1452
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you can hear if you hear that you've reached it,</v>

1453
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 1>reached that level in that position with the weed.</v>

1454
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It makes it a lot easier for me.</v>

1455
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser.</v>

1456
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I know you ain't really.</v>

1457
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1458
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason why in Yoga may have very well been invented.</v>

1459
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 1>According to Mckenna,</v>

1460
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.520
<v Speaker 1>they believe he believes they were,</v>

1461
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they invented yoga to maximize the,</v>

1462
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:11.261
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1463
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:11.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1464
00:40:11.491 --> 00:40:11.891
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1465
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 1>effects of eating cannabis.</v>

1466
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's something I've gotten high play basketball.</v>

1467
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I've got high lifting weights.</v>

1468
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like eating a little bit of weed and go to yoga.</v>

1469
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a basic class just to focus on your breathing.</v>

1470
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:24.591
<v Speaker 1>I do it every Tuesday,</v>

1471
00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 1>like tomorrow I got rush and then go to the airport,</v>

1472
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do it now.</v>

1473
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Either that a bowl in the morning because I have nothing else and it is just</v>

1474
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking breathe my body.</v>

1475
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Randy Parsons,</v>

1476
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 1>your good friend Ryan Ryan was at the gym.</v>

1477
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Would they adjustments and there was an argument going on between trainers and</v>

1478
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>these guys were white guys.</v>

1479
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 1>They weren't heads and the guy was saying that he's been telling all his clients</v>

1480
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.381
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1481
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 1>if police after their workouts,</v>

1482
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:54.540
<v Speaker 1>their weight workouts to smoke a little reefer because it's a anti inflammatory</v>

1483
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and it works better than anything else.</v>

1484
00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Even like the letters should have the ass daddy and muscles.</v>

1485
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Lettuce like lettuce.</v>

1486
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 1>When you eat lettuce and pulls the acid out of your muscles,</v>

1487
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>work out something like that.</v>

1488
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:04.871
<v Speaker 1>Acid.</v>

1489
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:05.600
<v Speaker 1>This something.</v>

1490
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Let us do something after you work out the acid out of your muscles so they can</v>

1491
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:10.990
<v Speaker 1>recover or something.</v>

1492
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1493
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy was talking about does that.</v>

1494
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>We'd done anti inflammatories yes,</v>

1495
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and that they're scared to tell people because we'll go fucking crazy.</v>

1496
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1497
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.773
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes sense.</v>

1498
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a painkiller.</v>

1499
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 1>If people enjoy it for a pain,</v>

1500
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes sense that it would also be,</v>

1501
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1502
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 1>for inflammation.</v>

1503
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:31.460
<v Speaker 1>He said it's really good for your joints to do something with the.</v>

1504
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1505
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons they prescribed for arthritis people.</v>

1506
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that have chronic arthritis,</v>

1507
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 1>like I've talked to people that said that they literally couldn't move and then</v>

1508
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 1>they would smoke weed and then all of a sudden they could walk around like they</v>

1509
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:44.990
<v Speaker 1>could function,</v>

1510
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1511
00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 1>it allowed them to be,</v>

1512
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:47.603
<v Speaker 1>to be mobile.</v>

1513
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:48.921
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1514
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1515
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.263
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1516
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1517
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 1>it helps a lot of people in a lot of different ways.</v>

1518
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just a shame that we have to pretend that something wrong with it.</v>

1519
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 1>If people want to think it's not a big deal.</v>

1520
00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't you guys talk about we don't fucking losers.</v>

1521
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.843
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all,</v>

1522
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 1>we're not losers and don't be mean.</v>

1523
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

1524
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 1>it is a fucking important issue,</v>

1525
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1526
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 1>It is important.</v>

1527
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 1>We know ourselves,</v>

1528
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 1>how it affects us.</v>

1529
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 1>We know ourselves.</v>

1530
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

1531
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 1>how much more aware.</v>

1532
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Thank God you turn his mic off and stick it here and you still go there.</v>

1533
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 1>But what I wanted them we 20 years ago is not what I want from me today.</v>

1534
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.510
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to escape 20 years ago.</v>

1535
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1536
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

1537
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I have an only child,</v>

1538
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>so I love living in my head.</v>

1539
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:27.741
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

1540
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>you give me a fuck.</v>

1541
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You let me get my head.</v>

1542
00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:30.094
<v Speaker 1>You're a dead man.</v>

1543
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Say Yeah,</v>

1544
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you let me get my head.</v>

1545
00:42:32.191 --> 00:42:32.850
<v Speaker 1>The lonely child.</v>

1546
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking it down in little time.</v>

1547
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1548
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is to be in the closet.</v>

1549
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Playing Gi Joes,</v>

1550
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>making up your own world and Disneyland is outside your fucking closet.</v>

1551
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm an only child.</v>

1552
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I know how to get the party started my fucking head.</v>

1553
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like being alone.</v>

1554
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's that you can be with and the life pod you go fuck yourself.</v>

1555
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>

1556
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Two o'clock they go fuck yourself.</v>

1557
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.783
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those guys.</v>

1558
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Joey will vanish.</v>

1559
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I could go on an island solo.</v>

1560
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>

1561
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy.</v>

1562
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1563
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't creep out of my skin.</v>

1564
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Well listen man,</v>

1565
00:43:00.081 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful quality in comparison to the alternative.</v>

1566
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 1>The alternative is someone who needs people around them all the time and needs</v>

1567
00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>attention all the time and everybody knows how God down with knowing that is</v>

1568
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 1>rare that someone says extroverted as you,</v>

1569
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but also I guess it's just a balance to Yin and Yang,</v>

1570
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:17.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1571
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You need that downtime to.</v>

1572

<v Speaker 1>My wife.</v>

1575
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I always thought you had to be moving with.</v>

1576
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what kills people.</v>

1577
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>People don't make enough time for themselves themselves.</v>

1578
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And what's that?</v>

1579
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>A trip to Jamaica.</v>

1580
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 1>One hour.</v>

1581
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1582
00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:31.754
<v Speaker 1>people don't.</v>

1583
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't make enough.</v>

1584
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1585
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:34.251
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

1586
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 1>You got to manage your life correctly to to get to a position where you can</v>

1587
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 1>enjoy things because some people,</v>

1588
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 1>they're just scratching every week.</v>

1589
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1590
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Every week is scratching trying to get ahead.</v>

1591
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Can't get no fucking traction.</v>

1592
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure it all out.</v>

1593
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a tremendous amount of stress,</v>

1594
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:46.731
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1595
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Less than an hour.</v>

1596
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>He came over and were smoking the metallurgy and it was 10 to six or something</v>

1597
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and we heard this belt being being Mexican ice cream man,</v>

1598
00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and it is the best ice cream you'll ever have.</v>

1599
00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's dairy queen with ice cream and it makes a delicious banana split.</v>

1600
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd been there for a year now,</v>

1601
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>one brown spot over of data,</v>

1602
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny that you said to me,</v>

1603
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you get so much enjoyment for the ice cream truck.</v>

1604
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Your life is what you make enjoyment.</v>

1605
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not filthy loaded,</v>

1606
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but I get off on that fucking ice cream man coming</v>

1607
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:18.591
<v Speaker 1>to New York.</v>

1608
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:19.424
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Ralph.</v>

1609
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 1>He's in this hotel in the city and I got this and that.</v>

1610
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.243
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1611
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll come around if he doesn't use the Internet because he feels that his</v>

1612
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:29.264
<v Speaker 1>clientele,</v>

1613

1614
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer.</v>

1615
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the most ridiculous thing ever.</v>

1616
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 1>He's found the one percent of the population that isn't online.</v>

1617
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1618
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:39.320
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck isn't online?</v>

1619
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.081
<v Speaker 1>That's so silly.</v>

1620
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:42.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just really weird online.</v>

1621
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1622
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 1>that expression is so true.</v>

1623
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>That expression is so true.</v>

1624
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.250
<v Speaker 1>When chicken is another man's Gumbo,</v>

1637
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:14.450
<v Speaker 1>When I was a sophomore.</v>

1638
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.300
<v Speaker 1>They send a cup.</v>

1639
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 1>They have one of the best pupil platters and the Chinese food.</v>

1640
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.080
<v Speaker 1>So good on the east coast.</v>

1645
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not consistent.</v>

1646
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Not everything is good.</v>

1647

<v Speaker 1>You're going to see it and you going to go really?</v>

1709
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.170
<v Speaker 1>We in the right fucking place.</v>

1710
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It says Vianna cafe outside.</v>

1711
00:47:18.161 --> 00:47:23.161
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have a sign that says sounds comedy on the most low rent ghetto</v>

1712
00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 1>setup ever.</v>

1713
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's growing.</v>

1714
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1715
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.120
<v Speaker 1>eventually he's,</v>

1716
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1717
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.990
<v Speaker 1>he's doing construction is going to have the back.</v>

1718
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1719
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 2>going to be much better and bigger.</v>

1720
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And so this is just a spot.</v>

1721
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 2>He had a nice spot and labrea and he's a cool guy and he was always cool to</v>

1722
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.640
<v Speaker 2>comics and so we did you.</v>

1723
00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You recorded a secret.</v>

1724
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever do with that cd?</v>

1725
00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:42.000
<v Speaker 2>They recorded that I could use it.</v>

1726
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 2>No garbage.</v>

1727
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1728
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 2>What happened was wrong.</v>

1729
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.460
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird job because uh,</v>

1730
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 2>if you notice after that I changed everything.</v>

1731
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I hate listening to myself or watching myself.</v>

1732
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's get this out of the way.</v>

1733
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I got boxes and shit at the house.</v>

1734
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:55.691
<v Speaker 2>People give me,</v>

1735
00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:55.811
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1736
00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:56.511
<v Speaker 2>but I taped it.</v>

1737
00:47:56.511 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see myself not at all.</v>

1738
00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And I thought there was a problem and then one that I watched the Johnny Depp on</v>

1739
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Letterman and let them set them.</v>

1740
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So after the thing he was living in it.</v>

1741
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.813
<v Speaker 2>After I shoot,</v>

1742
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.193
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

1743
00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch myself because really who I felt.</v>

1744
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.261
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1745
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the only retaught.</v>

1746
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't like nothing about that.</v>

1747
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've never looked into myself doing stand up.</v>

1748
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I can't take my voice.</v>

1749
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But after I taped that special and listened to it,</v>

1750
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I was so ashamed of myself that I made notes in this shit and really helped me.</v>

1751
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 2>And I still,</v>

1752
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1753
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I bring the Ipod,</v>

1754
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I taped myself on short sets during the week.</v>

1755
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm up to like six minutes.</v>

1756
00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Then I got to shut it off,</v>

1757
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:33.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1758
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I can't listen to the whole thing and so it's hard to listen to yourself,</v>

1759
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:37.774
<v Speaker 2>but it's good.</v>

1760
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 2>It's good because like what you said,</v>

1761
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.281
<v Speaker 2>how you,</v>

1762
00:48:40.281 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you force yourself just take five years twisted.</v>

1763
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.411
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that,</v>

1764
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1765
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.191
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that.</v>

1766
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't just take it on the audience's reaction.</v>

1767
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:51.090
<v Speaker 2>You got to judge it as if you're a comic listening to another comic to,</v>

1768
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:51.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1769
00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:51.911
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

1770
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 2>when I listened to my stuff,</v>

1771
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering how would I feel about this?</v>

1772
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Is this funny to me?</v>

1773
00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:57.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1774
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:57.561
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1775
00:48:57.561 --> 00:49:01.480
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it and I will forget about how the audience is laughing.</v>

1776
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Why does this make me think?</v>

1777
00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1778
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:03.730
<v Speaker 2>does this make me.</v>

1779
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Do I think this is the right way to do this bit?</v>

1780
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Should I shorten this part?</v>

1781
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Is this too verbose?</v>

1782
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Is this to this or this or that?</v>

1783
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that,</v>

1784
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1785
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>everything gets tighter and stronger.</v>

1786
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 2>You focus on it.</v>

1787
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 2>It's uncomfortable though.</v>

1788
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible feeling.</v>

1789
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.223
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you're.</v>

1790
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing,</v>

1791
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:18.791
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1792
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 2>or the [inaudible] the same as the energy that brings you to be creative.</v>

1793
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 2>The energy that brings you to smash it on stage.</v>

1794
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.340
<v Speaker 2>That is not a selfish energy.</v>

1795
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 2>People think it is because it seems like it is because you're on stage going</v>

1796
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.451
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1797
00:49:31.451 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Cock sucker.</v>

1798
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's laughing and crying,</v>

1799
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 2>but to do it right,</v>

1800
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 2>to be tuned into those people,</v>

1801
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.950
<v Speaker 2>really you have to be almost selfless.</v>

1802
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 2>You have to be.</v>

1803
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to be tuned into this crazy way where it's all just about this fund</v>

1804
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:45.101
<v Speaker 2>that we're having.</v>

1805
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:46.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not about me.</v>

1806
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 2>It ain't about me.</v>

1807
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1808
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the opposite that you would get from like someone who like,</v>

1809
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 2>listens to themselves.</v>

1810
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:53.381
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1811
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:53.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1812
00:49:53.781 --> 00:49:54.614
<v Speaker 2>I'm the shit.</v>

1813
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.473
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me,</v>

1814
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm the shit.</v>

1815
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:56.841
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like,</v>

1816
00:49:56.841 --> 00:50:00.310
<v Speaker 2>just know that that's the police in that thinking like that is the poisoned that</v>

1817
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.360
<v Speaker 2>takes away the magic.</v>

1818
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Because if you start thinking you're the shadow,</v>

1819
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:03.731
<v Speaker 2>you start thinking,</v>

1820
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you know that you're something special and you'll lose your whole connection</v>

1821
00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>with the magic.</v>

1822
00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1823
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the reasons why you feel uncomfortable.</v>

1824
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to listen and you don't want to be that guy who wants to get,</v>

1825
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.321
<v Speaker 2>get in my car.</v>

1826
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Let's get my new toy set last night telling me what I did.</v>

1827
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 2>You ever been to someone's car and they make this mother fucking routine.</v>

1828
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1829
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.720
<v Speaker 2>tell me about this new bit.</v>

1830
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you could add to this?</v>

1831
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1832
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:25.061
<v Speaker 2>oh Geez.</v>

1833
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I wrote the joke.</v>

1834
00:50:25.931 --> 00:50:26.764
<v Speaker 2>I want to try it.</v>

1835
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Say That on stage and give you a way out,</v>

1836
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:32.260
<v Speaker 2>but don't try.</v>

1837
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:32.811
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried.</v>

1838
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to fucking Bro.</v>

1839
00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:34.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1840
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you say it or you don't say it.</v>

1841
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Just the idea that you're trying it out.</v>

1842
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:38.781
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1843
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>it ain't a fucking weapon,</v>

1844
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1845
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.170
<v Speaker 2>God Damn job a stage.</v>

1846
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.431
<v Speaker 2>Do It on a stage.</v>

1847
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Take your goddamn chances.</v>

1848
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And the more you do that,</v>

1850
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to talk to people about stuff like that.</v>

1851
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:49.520

1853
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time writing the zone with people.</v>

1854
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how do I get pissed off?</v>

1855
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 1>To a degree before I go on stage,</v>

1856
00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.700
<v Speaker 1>like I like a little pistol office.</v>

1857
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.820
<v Speaker 2>When you get mad you get like fake arguments with people.</v>

1858
00:51:02.821 --> 00:51:04.080

<v Speaker 2>From Bria.</v>

1903
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.510
<v Speaker 2>It was last night,</v>

1904
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:13.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1905
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:14.643
<v Speaker 2>It was Sunday night.</v>

1906
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1907
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody killed hardening that.</v>

1908
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.270
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that was closer to someone killing harder than that was when you</v>

1909
00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:24.760
<v Speaker 2>killed in Vegas at the Mandalay Bay theater.</v>

1910
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1911
00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.890
<v Speaker 2>When you were doing that bit about fucking having that fistfight with the nun.</v>

1912
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1913
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I might not have ever laughed that hard at anything ever in my whole life.</v>

1914
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It was the funniest thing I've ever seen</v>

1915
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Mr. comedy store.</v>

1916
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's the bad thing because during the week that's what you would enjoy</v>

1917
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.410
<v Speaker 1>laughing at each other like each other.</v>

1918
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:48.411
<v Speaker 1>And that really took away from my career because you see bill burga Tuesday and</v>

1919
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.170
<v Speaker 1>water die.</v>

1920
00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:49.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1921
00:52:49.531 --> 00:52:50.070
<v Speaker 1>he don't care.</v>

1922
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.570
<v Speaker 1>He's so confident was extended up.</v>

1923
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to try different things and you know,</v>

1924
00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:57.960
<v Speaker 1>we always get into conversations and style joke about the store that at the end</v>

1925
00:52:57.961 --> 00:52:58.980
<v Speaker 1>they will come to whatever,</v>

1926
00:52:58.981 --> 00:52:59.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1927
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't take away the truth from anything.</v>

1928
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really lacking.</v>

1929
00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had south is becoming thousands becoming.</v>

1930
00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I know we just need some more people to go on their support.</v>

1931
00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been out of town on Wednesdays.</v>

1932
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 2>We've got a plenty of plenty of people.</v>

1933
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Bill burroughs was by last week.</v>

1934

1938
00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 2>That dude.</v>

1939
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

1940
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Is he in jail?</v>

1941
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that dude.</v>

1942
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 2>That dude makes me laugh.</v>

1943
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 2>He makes me laugh like very few dudes.</v>

1944
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 2>He's one of my top favorite guys to watch how it's like if someone sends me a</v>

1945
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 2>clip,</v>

1946
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 2>someone sends me a clip and says like,</v>

1947
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:35.461

<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

1952
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.050

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:46.820
<v Speaker 2>he slides across the room,</v>

1954
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.850
<v Speaker 2>like he's kicking someone in the nuts and as he does it,</v>

1991
00:54:59.981 --> 00:55:01.800

<v Speaker 1>you watch that and you see the black people.</v>

1993
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:06.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know how to act because you see the truth.</v>

1994
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:06.811
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1995
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:10.610
<v Speaker 1>the truth is a motherfucker when you say it the right way and that stays even if</v>

1996
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.071
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

1997
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:11.904

2045
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2046
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2047
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you know what he had,</v>

2048
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.450
<v Speaker 2>he actually had some real good advice too that I took.</v>

2049
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>He said that uh,</v>

2050
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.310
<v Speaker 2>he listens to a,</v>

2051
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.790
<v Speaker 2>he has on his ipod,</v>

2052
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:40.310
<v Speaker 2>he has like a playlist of all music that he listens to right before he goes on</v>

2053
00:56:40.311 --> 00:56:41.144
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

2054
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.071
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like damn,</v>

2055
00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a great idea because I have just like a group of like some of my favorite</v>

2056
00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 2>songs on my ipod that I just,</v>

2057
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.581
<v Speaker 2>I throw on,</v>

2058
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 2>it's on my iphone too.</v>

2059
00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw them on like when I'm at the gym or whatever,</v>

2060
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.601
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2061
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a specific list just for,</v>

2062
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.133
<v Speaker 2>for standup,</v>

2063
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's a good fucking idea.</v>

2064
00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a real good idea.</v>

2065
00:56:58.511 --> 00:56:59.440
<v Speaker 2>So I started doing that.</v>

2066
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I started doing that just based on that,</v>

2067
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 2>because I know music,</v>

2068
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to like the right kind of music,</v>

2069
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know the right kind of music and fucking get you in a good groove man,</v>

2070
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2071
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.263
<v Speaker 2>especially if you haven't.</v>

2072
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you listen to music too much,</v>

2073
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 2>if you lose it's power,</v>

2074
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that feeling anymore and just loses its impact.</v>

2075
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 2>But every now and then a song which is Jack you and let you know what's</v>
