00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.853
<v Speaker 1>It's wrestling.</v>

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what fucked up your head.</v>

9
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>my coach is a world champion at 17 from Iran and then he left.</v>

10
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>He left the country and then couldn't wrestle in the Olympics,</v>

11
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>which she probably would have won because he didn't have his green card,</v>

12
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>so he would bring in all these super bad asses to just kick the shit out of me.</v>

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.040

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 2>for like an hour.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>

33
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>We'd store this.</v>

34
00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:59.020

35
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 2>They do the show.</v>

36
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like the underground comedy show.</v>

37
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 2>They do it in a weed store and the weed store is up like a bong shop in the</v>

38
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>front and a comedy club in the bag.</v>

39
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 2>And you go into the back and you can't see 10 feet in front of you.</v>

40
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>You are in the clouds.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's the worst hotbox ever.</v>

45
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 2>No ventilation whatsoever.</v>

46
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:20.411
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then again,</v>

47
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 2>they opened up the back door so nobody dies.</v>

48
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

49
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 2>There's no air Arab shoes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

54
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.490
<v Speaker 2>the whole room was filled with wheat and the iron sheik was in there getting</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why is that man?</v>

73
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Hey Sir,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't buy him that way.</v>

75
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He'd be muttering to meet the Farsi.</v>

76
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't just scan him,</v>

77
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.093

<v Speaker 2>Do you want to fuck him?</v>

79
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to hold him down.</v>

80
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is getting married.</v>

84
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Betty and I worked out at 24 hour fitness and there was this dude who was the</v>

85
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:26.491
<v Speaker 2>manager there.</v>

86
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 2>It was a cool guy.</v>

87
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 2>We just talked to him and uh,</v>

88
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>they had sent him over from the Santa Monica Place.</v>

89
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 2>He was like a real personable,</v>

90
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 2>real friendly guy.</v>

91
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 2>real easy to like.</v>

94
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.151
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

95
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

96
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 2>the Santa Monica police brought him in because they needed to get that place</v>

97
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 2>cleaned out because it had basically become just a fuck house.</v>

98
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Close the shower,</v>

99
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 2>hose them down everywhere.</v>

100
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 2>It'd be common condoms.</v>

101
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 2>But my buddy ended up working.</v>

102
00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.261
<v Speaker 2>That's how I find I,</v>

103
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but it ended up working at the same place and they used to have to trap dudes,</v>

104
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 2>gay dudes that were fucking in the sauna and stuff</v>

105
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.070
<v Speaker 3>and raped [inaudible] the cops came because it was relatively stations.</v>

106
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.390
<v Speaker 3>How people die,</v>

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Check out the people three rows and beyond looking at fat.</v>

118
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.710

120
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.520
<v Speaker 2>So they basically give you $10 back.</v>

121
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Then they give you a book of coupons for another 50 to eat to try to keep you</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like what had happened to him,</v>

392
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.630
<v Speaker 2>the lawyers sort of strategy for dealing with the case was that the girl should</v>

<v Speaker 2>have known,</v>

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:09.810
<v Speaker 2>was to like make it look like he was just a bad guy.</v>

00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:51.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he can do this.</v>

454
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>He's too big.</v>

455
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.053

<v Speaker 2>Too late though for this round.</v>

462
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>But when he got Bob inside controller's working,</v>

584
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.350

590
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:08.221
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

591
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's probably kind of macho.</v>

592
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.060
<v Speaker 1>We kind of,</v>

593
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.380

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.200
<v Speaker 1>He's not from America.</v>

597
00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like a cultural thing.</v>

598
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.181
<v Speaker 1>Made a minute.</v>

600
00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:23.140
<v Speaker 1>He let a guy finger your ass and then blow you.</v>

601
00:18:23.141 --> 00:18:24.220
<v Speaker 1>That is a gap.</v>

602
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.083
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

603
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>

604
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would say.</v>

612
00:18:36.581 --> 00:18:37.414
<v Speaker 1>We got to share one.</v>

613
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

614
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm having sex.</v>

615
00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:39.790

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 1>well and hard and he was working at peace.</v>

620
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I know dudes go both ways,</v>

621
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.890

622
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

623
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.070
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who hasn't done that other in other places.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But he was so macho,</v>

661
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but you hold on a second,</v>

662
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.383
<v Speaker 1>bag it up.</v>

663
00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.361
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

664
00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

665
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember these stories.</v>

666
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Either you forget the stories and gay guy who tried to finger your ass as soon</v>

667
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 1>as hold this other guy.</v>

668
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.990
<v Speaker 1>This is where the guide or finger his ass and blow them.</v>

669
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.360
<v Speaker 1>But that guy never admitted it to anybody else.</v>

670
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

671
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know if it's even true?</v>

672
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:00.970
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

673
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:01.810
<v Speaker 1>he's a trickster.</v>

674
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You said the guy wasn't even the way she did it because he only told my other</v>

675
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:05.991
<v Speaker 1>friend who was gay.</v>

676
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It was gay.</v>

677
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Made him say not tell anybody because he's lying.</v>

678
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.770
<v Speaker 1>It could easily be because he's alive and he's got a fantasy of blowing your</v>

679
00:20:14.771 --> 00:20:15.311
<v Speaker 1>heart ass.</v>

680
00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Jordanian friend made the story up and then you had bay tells you like it's look</v>

681
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.500
<v Speaker 1>guy blows everybody good.</v>

682
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Let them blow yet.</v>

683
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

684
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was the next thing you know the guy who was a new assay close.</v>

685
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.553
<v Speaker 1>A big secret.</v>

686
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want the Gig.</v>

687
00:20:28.271 --> 00:20:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want anybody to know.</v>

688
00:20:29.231 --> 00:20:29.681
<v Speaker 1>He told,</v>

689
00:20:29.681 --> 00:20:31.360
<v Speaker 1>cause you probably thought your friend would kill him.</v>

690
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.860
<v Speaker 1>The Jordanian friend.</v>

691
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a Middle Eastern guy.</v>

692
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It's very likely Zeus or not.</v>

693
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

694
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>no he was soft,</v>

695
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:40.750
<v Speaker 1>weak bro.</v>

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.110

697
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gay dudes and then there's really gullible straight dudes who</v>

700
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>That's probably true.</v>

701
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what a bisexual is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was fighting.</v>

781
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole story about prostitution now.</v>

782
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.521
<v Speaker 1>no it wasn't,</v>

784
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't,</v>

785
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I was not trying to pick up prostitutes.</v>

786
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I see the story that you tell me what he was doing.</v>

787
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I have paid for sex.</v>

788
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Now anyone who knows me knows that and I believe in it.</v>

789
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:04.534
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't done it.</v>

790
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Believe in it.</v>

791
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really,</v>

792
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 1>it does exist.</v>

793
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not Santa Claus.</v>

794
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

795
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:09.821
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

796
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it.</v>

797
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it in my adult years because I don't want to,</v>

798
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

799
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.461
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't turn me on.</v>

800
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And for a lot of reasons I just don't want to be part of it.</v>

801
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.063
<v Speaker 1>But you're married.</v>

802
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.620

805
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it because I have my own responsive.</v>

806
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>You want someone to be attracted to you?</v>

810
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.191
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of reasons.</v>

811
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I have a philosophy behind it.</v>

812
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:31.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:51.241
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

975
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:51.340

<v Speaker 2>these hoes ain't loyal.</v>

983
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.470
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] John,</v>

984
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.070
<v Speaker 2>you know the stories of a John.</v>

985
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 2>My real problem with all of it is when you make something illegal,</v>

986
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 2>it puts all this extra energy in something because you create consequences.</v>

987
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 2>The consequences being you could go to jail,</v>

988
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>

989
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:22.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of issues can happen.</v>

991
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:24.901
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

992
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 2>is it a,</v>

993
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a misdemeanor.</v>

994
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Solicit prostitution,</v>

995
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:27.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

996
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not a Snellen knocked down.</v>

997
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Carry a gun and you could still vote,</v>

998
00:27:32.511 --> 00:27:33.344
<v Speaker 2>but either way,</v>

999
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind what they're taking,</v>

1000
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>what your freedom and putting you in the system.</v>

1001
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 2>You also probably have to register as some sort of a sex offender</v>

1002
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.493
<v Speaker 2>dates you do.</v>

1003
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I had a bed in some states in Calabasas for sure.</v>

1004
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.731
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1005
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 2>You're [inaudible] man.</v>

1006
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it depends on what the fuck you're doing.</v>

1007
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.051
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1008
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>like what are you doing with the prostitute?</v>

1009
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 2>When you get this figured out,</v>

1010
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>you're still making a fire from your job and kind of big consequences.</v>

1011
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the point is in countries like Australia where they have legalized</v>

1012
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.514
<v Speaker 2>prostitution,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're divorce rate is way lower.</v>

1014
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1015
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't have like all this violent crime,</v>

<v Speaker 2>prostitution need.</v>

1017
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.693
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1018
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 2>with violent crime,</v>

1019
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't need John's.</v>

1020
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1021
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.560
