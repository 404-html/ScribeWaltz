1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you'd just have a huge marble.</v>

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I've never understood the pipe white market I've probably had in my life,</v>

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 paperweights.</v>

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of that dead.</v>

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a bit where I'm like,</v>

7
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>my paper has been so out of control.</v>

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

9
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.091
<v Speaker 1>I just shut.</v>

10
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:18.924
<v Speaker 1>We knows.</v>

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.711
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

12
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a window shutter.</v>

13
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I see that as an easier fix than just paper blowing everywhere or,</v>

14
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and plus there's so many outside,</v>

15
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>like in your yard,</v>

16
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>if you really needed something to weight it down.</v>

17
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>A book is one.</v>

18
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Anything's one.</v>

19
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Like these people who,</v>

20
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>who've made us think that it's an actual invention that we're like,</v>

21
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>we'll build an actual glass object with a spindly thing in the middle.</v>

22
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and then everybody else was like,</v>

24
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

25
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>we got to get involved with that market.</v>

26
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

27
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.971
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

28
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>we've got to jump on that globe.</v>

29
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Wonder,</v>

30
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's patented or patent.</v>

31
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It could be patented,</v>

32
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>painted.</v>

33
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you would say thing?</v>

34
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would say it,</v>

35
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but I still think that's the wrong way to say it.</v>

36
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:03.944
<v Speaker 1>In my accent.</v>

37
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>But you just take it with me speaking like a Todd.</v>

38
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was,</v>

39
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was anything to do with being Australian.</v>

40
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre how similar Australians are two Americans,</v>

41
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>even though like,</v>

42
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you guys have a different accent,</v>

44
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>the accents a little,</v>

46
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>a little odd for us,</v>

47
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we're seeing more similar to the British person you are as well.</v>

49
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.071
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's,</v>

50
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how you go there.</v>

51
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to,</v>

52
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

53
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.951
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

55
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:31.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you just could fit right in.</v>

57
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>The accent melts after a day,</v>

58
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's just what people sound like.</v>

59
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like you're in America.</v>

60
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice the American accent now on anybody at all.</v>

62
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's only when I have to do an audition and they make me do the American accent</v>

63
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>that I get a bit shitty with the whole thing.</v>

64
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>do they do that?</v>

66
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>They would make you change your voice.</v>

67
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And like I fucked that one audition.</v>

69
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple of callbacks and then I said the word,</v>

70
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.044
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.741
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

72
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:56.981
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

73
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I went to the zoo and I saw a zebra.</v>

74
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I still said Zebra in,</v>

75
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>and he just said that I still set it in an American accent,</v>

76
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>but with British phrasing and they freak the fuck out.</v>

77
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I need to hear more of this American voice.</v>

78
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a creepy voice,</v>

79
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

80
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

81
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so creepy?</v>

82
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

83
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.923
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do,</v>

84
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.091
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

85
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>that is creepy as fuck you talking with an American voice.</v>

86
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

87
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.501
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

88
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:20.334
<v Speaker 1>it w I'm sort of,</v>

89
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say synonymous with Vice.</v>

90
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't a lot on stage and people always want me to say,</v>

91
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 1>can't like when they have photos and it talking about in my accent,</v>

92
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>if I say can't,</v>

93
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

94
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it sounds great,</v>

95
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but even when I state can't,</v>

96
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>as an American,</v>

97
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I've go,</v>

98
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.883
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

99
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bit harsh dude.</v>

100
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You sound like a totally different human when you look at that fucking cut over</v>

101
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

102
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

103
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

104
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you never think that's Jim Jefferies?</v>

105
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:45.511
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

106
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.201
<v Speaker 1>I would think that's,</v>

107
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

108
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.591
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

109
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing is called me up.</v>

110
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>That would freak me the fuck out.</v>

111
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:50.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm tell you right now,</v>

112
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>don't do that just because of the sound guy.</v>

113
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:54.241
<v Speaker 1>Is that the no,</v>

114
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.074
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound,</v>

115
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>it sounds,</v>

116
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>just want to speak to you very quickly.</v>

117
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>We have a few problems here right now.</v>

118
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It sounds vaguely fucked up.</v>

119
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Like [inaudible] it doesn't sound right.</v>

120
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounds really good though.</v>

121
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so close to like a real person.</v>

122
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Not like there's something affected about doing an accent.</v>

123
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

124
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear you in and,</v>

125
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and do it.</v>

126
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.580
<v Speaker 1>He kind of make a deal like a fighter.</v>

127
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm still actually,</v>

128
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't bad but I like putting on a second.</v>

129
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I would say we don't say shit.</v>

130
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

131
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

132
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I do more English like,</v>

133
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>well mine's 50 50 cause I lived in England for 10 years,</v>

134
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>but we don't say the word.</v>

135
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't say the word shrimp.</v>

136
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

137
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>this is like Americans go prawns,</v>

138
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:38.411
<v Speaker 1>shrimp.</v>

139
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>We call them prawns.</v>

140
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.443
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

141
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Paul Hogan does that fucking commercial where he goes,</v>

142
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.181
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

143
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>we'll throw another shrimp on the Barbie for you like that.</v>

144
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

145
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And now that's like synonymous with Australians strains when that's not even a</v>

146
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:49.331
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

147
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>We say I appeal,</v>

148
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>yell that out at American gigs,</v>

149
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm on stage,</v>

150
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>go do the shrimp thing.</v>

151
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:54.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

152
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck off?</v>

153
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird how many like crazy personalities have come out of Australia?</v>

154
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the crocodile hunter?</v>

155
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>All Hogan Crocodile Dundee?</v>

156
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

158
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.891
<v Speaker 1>He was out.</v>

159
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Diana.</v>

160
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

161
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>crocodile and I go to l.</v>

162
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

163
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:11.194
<v Speaker 1>He was here.</v>

164
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>He lives around here somewhere.</v>

165
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Does it kangaroo Jack.</v>

166
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>They only did a couple of those crocodile dundees though and then there were</v>

167
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

168
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that could have been like some Indiana Jones type shit.</v>

169
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I know they do.</v>

170
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.393
<v Speaker 1>The third,</v>

171
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the third ones are Pauling.</v>

172
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>The third one's always strive to Davey Day.</v>

173
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.714
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

175
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's like case was,</v>

176
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea was a crocodile.</v>

177
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Dundee went from Australia in the outback of Australia to New York and it's</v>

178
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.251
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

179
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's he going to do?</v>

180
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>This is such a different place so you can survive out there,</v>

181
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but he can't survive here.</v>

182
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>So that happened for the first two films.</v>

183
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Then for the third film,</v>

184
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you think let's send him to another country like Britain or somewhere else.</v>

185
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

186
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's Crocodile Dundee.</v>

187
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.673
<v Speaker 1>Nla.</v>

188
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is,</v>

189
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>he's been living since the last crocodile benefit Dundee film.</v>

190
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>He's been living in New York for over a decade.</v>

191
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets to La and he doesn't know what's going on.</v>

192
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Why it gets too alarming for him.</v>

193
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Like what are all these people wearing sunglasses for?</v>

194
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>This is weird,</v>

195
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.140
<v Speaker 1>cheesy.</v>

196
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>These women's breasts are too big.</v>

197
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

198
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not a great film.</v>

199
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>And in the end he becomes an animal trainer,</v>

200
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>for the movies.</v>

202
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Any foils,</v>

203
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:17.704
<v Speaker 1>a robbery.</v>

204
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 1>An animal.</v>

205
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Actually now I look back at it.</v>

206
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a great film.</v>

207
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

208
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you ready to record recording?</v>

209
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

210
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.434
<v Speaker 1>it is already.</v>

211
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.520
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's on?</v>
