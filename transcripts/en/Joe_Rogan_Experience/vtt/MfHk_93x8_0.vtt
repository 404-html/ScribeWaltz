<v Speaker 1>It's good to be here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to be here too with you and to</v>

7
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>talk knocking shit over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be trusted.</v>

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alien worlds and the fate of the earth.</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>All about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's deep shit,</v>

10
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>just the title alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

12
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love aliens.</v>

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>

14
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:39.471
<v Speaker 1>But what are your thoughts on actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens and whether or not they've ever </v>

15
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>visited here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>sorta two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all we should tell everybody</v>

18
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>you have a background in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

19
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm an astrophysicist at the University </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Rochester.</v>

20
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I run a research group that studies like</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and planets.</v>

21
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not a crazy person I </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought on here.</v>

22
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a card carrying scientists.</v>

24
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I got my card and everything.</v>

25
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

26
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing research on astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics for a long time,</v>

27
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but I also do all this popular writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like for Npr,</v>

28
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the genesis of this book came a </v>

29
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>because I love science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been reading science fiction since I was</v>

30
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:16.251
<v Speaker 1>but also I do a lot of work on climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and so I do a lot of climate </v>

32
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:19.461
<v Speaker 1>change denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I realized was that there's </v>

33
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.041
<v Speaker 1>this way we talk about it that is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely forgets about the fact that </v>

34
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably not the first,</v>

35
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

36
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>that led me to a whole bunch of research</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually led to this book,</v>

37
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including one paper that we did that </v>

38
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>showed that the odds that we're the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>time it's ever happened,</v>

39
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>only you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only civilization in the entire </v>

40
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>history of the universe.</v>

41
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>The only way that that could be true is </v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

42
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds per planet are one in 10 </v>

43
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>billion trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the odds of anything being one in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion trillion at pretty freaking low.</v>

48
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>it's probably happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>there's been other civilizations before </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

51
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And once you realize that man that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

52
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes everything about how we think </v>

53
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>about ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>and what's happening to us right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other civilizations before ours that </v>

55
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>have fucked things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of the premise,</v>

56
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what,</v>

57
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at climate change,</v>

58
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what we it is,</v>

59
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>is civilizations are giant machines for </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning energy into work,</v>

60
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>You sit over and you look at Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

63
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this energy flowing into it.</v>

64
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all this work being </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

65
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep everything moving.</v>

66
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no way not to have an impact if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you build a world girdling civilization,</v>

68
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what a civilization is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be impact.</v>

70
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:39.381
<v Speaker 1>So the whole point of my doing this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to start looking at ourselves as </v>

71
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>just one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>we're not alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>The only time this has ever happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean anybody's around now,</v>

74
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>like that's a different question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that like,</v>

75
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>it's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meaning like,</v>

76
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>civilization what's happening around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these machinery and everything that</v>

78
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:59.091
<v Speaker 1>that just in the new world of what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about planets and shit that </v>

80
00:02:59.091 --> 00:02:59.091
<v Speaker 1>is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:03.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not tenable anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to wake up the idea that some </v>

82
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>civilization has to be the first one.</v>

83
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way you could ever think that </v>

84
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we're the only ones is that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization has to be the first one.</v>

85
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Even in a universe that's infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.480
<v Speaker 1>it has to happen one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the ideas are the conditions ideal </v>

87
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>in a trillion different spots all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

88
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>the infinite spanse of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing,</v>

89
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we've learned,</v>

90
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my trips right now is like,</v>

91
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this is not your grandfather's steady </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

92
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our understanding,</v>

93
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>we went through this major revolution in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our understanding of what planets about </v>

94
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he looked back at the Greeks,</v>

95
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see them arguing about when </v>

96
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.591
<v Speaker 1>he were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any other stars have planets other than </v>

97
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:46.591
<v Speaker 1>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

98
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it goes back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>some of the Greeks were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

100
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely happening.</v>

101
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aristotle was like,</v>

102
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the only world in this whole,</v>

103
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>in the whole universe that has life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as time goes on,</v>

104
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:01.171
<v Speaker 1>it kind of goes back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even at the turn of the last of </v>

105
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:01.171
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought planets were incredibly </v>

107
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>rare that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>

108
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.531
<v Speaker 1>they thought the only way you can get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet with two stars past really close </v>

109
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:10.231
<v Speaker 1>to each other and they kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>taffy pulled out stuff that will </v>

110
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:12.871
<v Speaker 1>eventually form a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lots of those kinds of </v>

111
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:12.871
<v Speaker 1>collisions are so small that people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

112
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no planets and no plan.</v>

113
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>It's no life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>unless something really freaky is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

115
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>But then 20 years ago we discovered our </v>
<v Speaker 1>first planet orbiting that crazy.</v>

116
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>When you really think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years is such a short amount of time.</v>

117
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody knew before that,</v>

119
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>like nobody knew whether there were any </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets.</v>

120
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

121
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>when I was starting to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

122
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:36.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know whether there's going to </v>

123
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:36.901
<v Speaker 1>be any other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we went from a to z.</v>

124
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>The first one was actually 96,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think [inaudible] 95,</v>

125
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

126
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>from that to now where we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fricking star in the sky had the </v>

127
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>planet at least one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everyone pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

129
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the big giant ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>

130
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.251
<v Speaker 1>but they're so rare that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every star you see in the </v>

131
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>sky has a family of planets around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so nuts.</v>

132
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>It's so nice that this is such a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

133
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>when we think about what we know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>

135
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>we think that we've had a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of it for a long time.</v>

136
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that we didn't even know </v>

137
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 1>for sure that there are planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

138
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my own lifetime,</v>

139
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were teaching me when I was </v>

140
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>starting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>we just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're rare and now we know for </v>

142
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.571
<v Speaker 1>certain that they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people have to realize is </v>

143
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>every one of those planets is a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

144
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a place you could walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them for sure are going to have </v>

145
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be mountains,</v>

146
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be rain falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean like they're all freaking places </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all places where things can </v>

148
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

149
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:35.611
<v Speaker 1>planets are basically like nature's way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking sunlight and doing something </v>

150
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:39.181
<v Speaker 1>interesting with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have 10 billion trillion planets </v>

151
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And every one of them is an experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being run.</v>

153
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that like,</v>

154
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.290
<v Speaker 1>we're the first time it's out now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that right now that we've gone </v>

155
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>through that revolution and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that planets are like,</v>

156
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.780
<v Speaker 1>diamond doesn't planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're not only talking about </v>

157
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.121
<v Speaker 1>planetary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking what plants are in the </v>

158
00:05:57.121 --> 00:05:58.201
<v Speaker 1>right place for life to form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the idea of the habitable </v>

159
00:05:58.201 --> 00:05:58.201
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:05:58.201 --> 00:05:58.201
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:05:58.201 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>mercury sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot,</v>

162
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mercury so hot that there no way </v>

163
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 1>anything's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

164
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.761
<v Speaker 1>planets that are far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far enough out there going to be so </v>

165
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:06.761
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they're so far away from their star that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna be so cold that,</v>

167
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get liquid water on the </v>

168
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.811
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we defined the habitable or </v>

169
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>goldilocks zone is the place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have,</v>

170
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.971
<v Speaker 1>you can pour water onto the surface and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just sit there and will freeze </v>

171
00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:18.971
<v Speaker 1>and it will sort of just evaporate away.</v>

172
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.360
<v Speaker 1>all these 10 billion trillion planets </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about are all in the right </v>

174
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.360
<v Speaker 1>place for life to form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

175
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And so like with that many numbers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many experiments being run,</v>

176
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:33.611
<v Speaker 1>like you got to be a psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimists to say that like this is the </v>

177
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>only time a civilization has ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

178
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's still no evidence yet.</v>

179
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we didn't even know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really absolutely were planets </v>

180
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.640
<v Speaker 1>until 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

181
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know for sure that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else out there.</v>

182
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

183
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>This is an argument by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it like an argument by </v>

184
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

185
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.491
<v Speaker 1>if I gave you a bag of 10 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion planets and you have to sort </v>

186
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:54.491
<v Speaker 1>through all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>The odds that you're gonna you're never </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna find another one that,</v>

188
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that built a civilization is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:03.791
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really asking for really serious </v>

190
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:03.791
<v Speaker 1>pessimism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

191
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:03.791
<v Speaker 1>we're just getting started with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

192
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking for life.</v>

193
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why I keep saying it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not your grandfather's said </v>

194
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>where you're like you're pointing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>a radio telescope at a star and you kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wait to see whether somebody signal </v>

196
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 1>signaling you who knows whether they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling who knows what they'd be </v>

197
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 1>using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

198
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.671
<v Speaker 1>what we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we got all these planets to </v>

199
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:21.671
<v Speaker 1>stare at his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be able to like stare at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as they pass in front of their star</v>

201
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>and get the light that passes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>their atmosphere.</v>

202
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what we're going to find,</v>

203
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not waiting for them to signal us </v>

204
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:32.411
<v Speaker 1>anymore over the next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

205
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next 30 years we're going to have</v>

206
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>data relevant to the question of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not civilization,</v>

207
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>so that could happen too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just life on other worlds,</v>

208
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've never had that for all the </v>

209
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.481
<v Speaker 1>arguments for the entire history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity have just been two dudes </v>

210
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:46.481
<v Speaker 1>yelling at each other.</v>

211
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the next 30 years because the </v>

212
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 1>stuff we're building and now that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's,</v>

213
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>

215
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have real data to argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>over with.</v>

216
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.660
<v Speaker 1>So now it's like this is where we're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole nother ballgame.</v>

217
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the big fear for a lot of people</v>

218
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:01.841
<v Speaker 1>is what happens when we find out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that there's something else out </v>

219
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:04.991
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we really do find like some other </v>

220
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan on some goldilocks planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

221
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it's hovering some similarly sized star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a billion light years away or whatever </v>

222
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be very,</v>

223
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

224
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a game changer,</v>

225
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for religions,</v>

226
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

228
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do if you find other </v>

229
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>intelligent creatures were building </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

230
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 1>started making them pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

231
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.660
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>get pissed off that they're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want them to do.</v>

233
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You should be believing this bunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:38.761
<v Speaker 1>for me the thing is like it's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change because what it means is </v>

237
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from my perspective,</v>

238
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

239
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that if you have a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push your planet,</v>

240
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop it in some sense of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a civilization.</v>

241
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:50.951
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the only way around that is if you </v>

242
00:08:50.951 --> 00:08:53.081
<v Speaker 1>have like a subsistence culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous native American culture,</v>

243
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it seems impossible,</v>

244
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but it existed here 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a blink of an eye.</v>

245
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

246
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.431
<v Speaker 1>It's only 200 years since the ramp up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your that the world population only </v>

247
00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>crossed up the billion mark and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>1850,</v>

248
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were so few of us on the </v>

249
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.070
<v Speaker 1>planet for most of the time that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

250
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>We've been around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget the planet's history.</v>

251
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

252
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like there is no discovery if we</v>

253
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.940
<v Speaker 1>were to get any evidence you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

254
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I think the way it's going to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be more by accident than by </v>

255
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:26.950
<v Speaker 1>like signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

257
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we had any evidence of another </v>

258
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>technological forget any evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just life,</v>

259
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we just find a biosphere evidence </v>

260
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and we can do that from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

262
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

263
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>if the star is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>30 light years away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we get,</v>

265
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.691
<v Speaker 1>if we see as the light passes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the star's atmosphere for those few </v>

266
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we see oxygen in the atmosphere,</v>

267
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be able to attack that.</v>

268
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:52.191
<v Speaker 1>That's what we can do with telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can tell like what you can see the </v>

269
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:52.191
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints of the different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>

270
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>If we see oxygen in the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>and methane that pretty much says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a biosphere there,</v>

272
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>that there's life because you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get oxygen,</v>

273
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 1>would just react away really fast if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for life like in our,</v>

274
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for life.</v>

276
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.350
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no oxygen in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the possibilities of life that </v>

277
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 1>exists in a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment than we expect.</v>

278
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I know that they found life at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean is volcanic events </v>

279
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 1>at extreme heats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boiling water that didn't expect to see </v>

280
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is fairly recent as well.</v>

281
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

282
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because right.</v>

283
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>This whole definition of the habitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone was based on the idea like,</v>

284
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have a surface and it's got </v>

285
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:30.830
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but now with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

287
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>not every but like a bunch of the moons </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbiting Jupiter and Saturn,</v>

288
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the gas giants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have oceans under them.</v>

289
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

290
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 1>this thoughts that you rope up might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something below the surface,</v>

291
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:44.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Europa is a pretty big moon </v>

293
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>and we know it's covered in ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

294
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You can see it's covered in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and we think that layer of ice is maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

296
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 kilometers thick and then below that </v>

297
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>there may be 100 kilometers of ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as it moves around Jupiter,</v>

298
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 1>it's con the gravity of Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So squishing the insights at this </v>

299
00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 1>probably volcanic activity happening at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface.</v>

300
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>So you have hydrothermal vents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:04.971
<v Speaker 1>heat escaping out of then chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaping out of the surface under the </v>

302
00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:08.631
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we think life form on </v>

303
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:08.631
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the arguments for how life</v>

304
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 1>forms from formed first in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrothermal vents.</v>

305
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.870
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new day.</v>

306
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>That's another game changer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

307
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.110
<v Speaker 1>So that we should also be thinking not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about the,</v>

308
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 1>the classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

309
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the habitable zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we've got to think about like </v>

310
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>life and can you get civilizations in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater civilization?</v>

311
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an underwater you,</v>

312
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a really rich ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

313
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 1>with the problem with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an underwater life or forming </v>

315
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 1>civilization is that you can't really do</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

316
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire was pretty important for us.</v>

317
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>For metallurgy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>to build advanced technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of need combustion.</v>

319
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.110
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the open question with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

321
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really concerned with animals.</v>

322
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Speaker 1>We're concerned with things that think </v>
<v Speaker 1>and change their environment.</v>

323
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>There isn't that weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we are concerned with life,</v>

324
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>but we're only concerned with life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it least similar or comparable to</v>

325
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microbes don't like.</v>

326
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

327
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>we don't that I'm going to go to Jupiter</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some microbes,</v>

328
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but we are excited about the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've recently found on Mars.</v>

329
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a very recent discovery,</v>

330
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>the thing is actually from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>so I'm gonna I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked in a lot of fields,</v>

334
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but I would also consider myself an </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrobiologist.</v>

335
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:15.781
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a pretty kind of a wild idea </v>

336
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:15.781
<v Speaker 1>that you can do astrobiology even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have one example,</v>

337
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 1>which is the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've learned so much and now we can</v>

338
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>start asking ourselves about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of life elsewhere.</v>

339
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>So finding even a microbe like even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frigging,</v>

340
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amoeba on Mars would be,</v>

341
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.360
<v Speaker 1>or even evidence that there used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

342
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but what is the evidence that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered on Mars?</v>

343
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 1>What they found was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic chemistry,</v>

344
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so our better organic chemistry man,</v>

345
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I hated chemistry when I was growing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hated,</v>

346
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 1>or was that just basically chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in carbon,</v>

347
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can have non or organic chemistry</v>

348
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:49.261
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the kind of chemistry that </v>

349
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:49.261
<v Speaker 1>organisms live.</v>

350
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So finding evidence that there was like </v>

351
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they drilled nice and we sent a freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot cars that could drill through a </v>

352
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and then ingest the rocket and then send</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data back.</v>

354
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Cross space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty good for a bunch of </v>

355
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>hairless apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

356
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they found was evidence for fairly </v>

357
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

358
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic chemistry,</v>

360
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>which meant that way back when Mars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

361
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>we know for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

362
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:19.441
<v Speaker 1>Mars had water on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that for sure now Mars was a </v>

363
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:22.201
<v Speaker 1>blue planet for Mars was hit by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid or comet or something along </v>

364
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything got hit by comments.</v>

365
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>That's how we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>we have chunks of Mars here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

367
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the thing in [inaudible] 96 or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were like,</v>

369
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found life on Mars,</v>

370
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:34.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought that what they found was a </v>

371
00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>fossil bacteria in a chunk of Mars that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found in Antarctica.</v>

372
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 1>So the planets have been swapping spit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like the entire history of the solar</v>

373
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fossilized bacteria that they found.</v>

374
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:45.871
<v Speaker 1>Is that been confirmed that most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>now think that the Allen hills a </v>

375
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>meteorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably,</v>

376
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inconclusive,</v>

377
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's not conclusive enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

378
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found life.</v>

379
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tiny little squiggly worm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

380
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

381
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:57.781
<v Speaker 1>But it was so small that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>waist smaller than any of the </v>

382
00:13:57.781 --> 00:13:57.781
<v Speaker 1>microscopic fossilized bacteria we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen before.</v>

383
00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:00.230
<v Speaker 1>So people in general are like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

384
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but by fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what started,</v>

385
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when Clinton was like,</v>

386
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:08.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send a lot of shit to </v>

387
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:08.761
<v Speaker 1>Mars because after I went back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 90 [inaudible],</v>

388
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were kind of done with Mars.</v>

389
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what triggered the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>one space probe after another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rovers and like,</v>

391
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>the thing we found was a direct result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that effort,</v>

393
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>which was this organic chemistry which </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that back in the day Morris had had</v>

394
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this stuff lying around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of these,</v>

395
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

396
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>these organic chemicals line around </v>
<v Speaker 1>which if your life,</v>

397
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're going to be using.</v>

398
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's like one more step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've been putting the Lego blocks </v>

399
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>for the argument for life on Mars one </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece at a time since the.</v>

400
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Since the first rovers went there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>If we did discover just even plants on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other planet,</v>

402
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>even just a planet with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant life,</v>

403
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.770
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a game changer,</v>

404
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.780
<v Speaker 1>game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because right now we don't know if </v>

405
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:54.780
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

406
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we the only time in the entire </v>

407
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 1>history of the universe that like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy thing where you got,</v>

408
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.920
<v Speaker 1>we went from non life to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that common or is that never </v>

409
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever happened?</v>

410
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's the question we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to answer.</v>

411
00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 1>that argument was given before is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think from the probable arguments.</v>

414
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:15.821
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost overwhelming that you had </v>

416
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:15.821
<v Speaker 1>probably happened somewhere.</v>

417
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:15.821
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean anything here,</v>

418
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>but we need evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

419
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to build that evidence.</v>

420
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we do find something,</v>

421
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

422
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirder things would be if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>found something and there was a way to </v>

423
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

425
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>we find something and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

426
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>we find something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

427
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty sure there's some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and its 3 billion light years away.</v>

428
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

429
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

430
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:36.760
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

431
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to know that we're not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only ones.</v>

432
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

433
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Like how much would that change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>even if we found evidence for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a debate,</v>

435
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:50.171
<v Speaker 1>like if we found evidence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological civilization we saw like </v>

436
00:15:50.171 --> 00:15:50.350
<v Speaker 1>alien mega structures like that star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they felt that.</v>

437
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 1>What was that nonsense really nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something floating around.</v>

438
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what they saw so that,</v>

439
00:15:56.241 --> 00:16:01.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we discover planets is we look </v>

440
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:01.790
<v Speaker 1>for when the planet passes in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the star,</v>

441
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you get a little dip in the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

442
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It blocks out a little bit of light to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the little eclipse.</v>

443
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

444
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've now,</v>

445
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 1>that's how we know that every star in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky has planets,</v>

446
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but there is like they found one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just made no sense,</v>

447
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>like the light would dip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what stopped dip and then we'll </v>

448
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>begin three times and it stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>dripping.</v>

449
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it was lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it was higher and you know,</v>

450
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.090
<v Speaker 1>for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people were like,</v>

451
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

452
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:23.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

454
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Jason Wright and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason's a friend of mine,</v>

455
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrote a paper where they were like,</v>

456
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 1>at least because this is what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future's going gonna look like.</v>

458
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.260
<v Speaker 1>We can't say we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to at least consider the </v>

459
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>possibility that these are artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that are orbiting the star or</v>

460
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be ungodly,</v>

461
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ungodly,</v>

462
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:45.941
<v Speaker 1>huge alien mega structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the best word for like the </v>

463
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:45.941
<v Speaker 1>size of a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

464
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:45.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

465
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 1>These things would be huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

466
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's what people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

467
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people think about advanced alien </v>

468
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.791
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of building large scale </v>

469
00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>structures is you think that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you do once you reach a </v>

470
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

471
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.861
<v Speaker 1>the dyson sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could collect all of </v>

473
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.531
<v Speaker 1>the sun's energy and use it for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>by building a giant sphere around the </v>

474
00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 1>sun with solar panels on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think like it goes back to Carter</v>

475
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of this Carter chef scale back </v>

476
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

477
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.721
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression of civilizations that goes </v>

478
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:16.721
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

479
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:19.870
<v Speaker 1>You collect all the energy you can from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your planet and then you use that to do </v>

480
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.021
<v Speaker 1>amazing things and then you collect all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy from your star and then you </v>

481
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:23.021
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do amazing shit with that.</v>

482
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

484
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:30.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carter Chef thought there was a scale </v>

485
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:30.341
<v Speaker 1>that civilizations naturally progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

486
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully you don't blow yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>

487
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the question.</v>

488
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:37.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've criticized the car chef scale in </v>

489
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:40.091
<v Speaker 1>one of the papers I recently did because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it fails to take into account is </v>

490
00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:40.091
<v Speaker 1>the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:43.751
<v Speaker 1>on your way up to the type one type one </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you harvest all the energy from </v>

492
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:47.621
<v Speaker 1>your planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means somehow covering </v>

493
00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:50.470
<v Speaker 1>your planet in our solar panels or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that neglects what we've </v>

494
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 1>learned since Carter Chef wrote his </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper in 64 is that,</v>

495
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets don't like that shit.</v>

496
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Like planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plan's gonna feed back.</v>

497
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You try and build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.100
<v Speaker 1>massive shit on your planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The planet has its own biosphere is </v>

499
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.610
<v Speaker 1>pretty powerful and you've got to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biosphere in the counter,</v>

500
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>you get climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the planet being pushed off in </v>

501
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

502
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the,</v>

503
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the alien mega structures,</v>

504
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>people thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

505
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is like a piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a dyson sphere,</v>

506
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

507
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

508
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 1>when he proposed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people went bonkers over this,</v>

510
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just saying,</v>

511
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

512
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>here's the 15 different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

513
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:24.081
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to have to at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider the possibility that it's </v>

514
00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:24.081
<v Speaker 1>artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

515
00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but for me and some people got really </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry everything,</v>

516
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get angry because there's been a </v>

517
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.390
<v Speaker 1>thing in the community over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.970
<v Speaker 1>said he got a bad name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

519
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Setting for a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of thought as being like,</v>

520
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only whackadoodles do that and why?</v>

521
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because there was no results.</v>

522
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of Shitty TV,</v>

525
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

526
00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I really in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

527
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it's prosthetic foreheads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

529
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had so much kind of crappy,</v>

530
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation about aliens.</v>

531
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I trying to do anything scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always had this whiff of sort of being a</v>

532
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:58.010
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

533
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the Ufo stuff which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely separate.</v>

534
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to do with it.</v>

535
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 2>He said he never really achieved any </v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

536
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:09.771
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was that one big blip that was </v>

537
00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:09.771
<v Speaker 2>highly popular items.</v>

538
00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:09.771
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Signal.</v>

539
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing about setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never really did set that much,</v>

540
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people have this idea like,</v>

541
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:19.371
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got telescopes all over the world </v>

542
00:19:19.371 --> 00:19:19.371
<v Speaker 1>and they're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

543
00:19:19.371 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 1>so the government never funded a study </v>
<v Speaker 1>study anything major,</v>

544
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

545
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that study has done is like </v>

546
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:26.890
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 1>some dudes on a telescope get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra time like,</v>

548
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go look at a star.</v>

549
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

550
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:30.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jill Tarter,</v>

551
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:34.020
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the founders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greats of Sadie,</v>

552
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Speaker 1>she compares it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

553
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got an ocean that we need to look </v>

554
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>at and which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far we've looked at a thimble,</v>

555
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

556
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.621
<v Speaker 1>the Jodie foster care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the jody foster character yet </v>

557
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:44.621
<v Speaker 1>we're in contact with today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's laying on.</v>

559
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we haven't really looked yet.</v>

560
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.560
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>the stars are silent or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like man,</v>

562
00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't even begun to do a </v>

563
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive.</v>

564
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Said he makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

565
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Because I feel like they're wasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>their time.</v>

566
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

567
00:19:59.391 --> 00:20:04.391
<v Speaker 2>there was a documentary I saw wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>about some biologist who was convinced </v>

568
00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:09.101
<v Speaker 2>that the giant sloths was still alive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there was examples of them in </v>

569
00:20:09.101 --> 00:20:13.511
<v Speaker 2>South America and this poor bastard had </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent more than a decade looking for </v>

570
00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:18.140
<v Speaker 2>this giant sloths in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>

571
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 2>there was this moment where he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing down this suppose the dung pile </v>

572
00:20:24.501 --> 00:20:29.501
<v Speaker 2>and they were looking for and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there and he had this look in his </v>

573
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 2>eyes were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

574
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I wasted my fucking life in my </v>

575
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.591
<v Speaker 2>academic career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing down something that's not even </v>

576
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:42.131
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how I've always felt </v>

577
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:42.131
<v Speaker 2>about setting.</v>

578
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:42.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the way the people.</v>

579
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was involved in it.</v>

580
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't do steady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:20:44.301 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I respect that people are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

584
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

585
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>most of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

586
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:51.180
<v Speaker 1>this is just a multigenerational thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

587
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I don't find it,</v>

588
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying the foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

589
00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cathedrals,</v>

590
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:59.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took like how many generations does </v>

591
00:20:59.251 --> 00:20:59.251
<v Speaker 1>it take to build a cathedral in Medieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe?</v>

592
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:02.731
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first guy who laid the stone was </v>

593
00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:02.731
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to see this,</v>

594
00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:02.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe my great grandkids.</v>

595
00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So most of them were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they know that this is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a huge.</v>

599
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most important question in</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

600
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we alone?</v>

601
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And they're willing to accept that.</v>

602
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do it scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to do it brick by </v>

604
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.920
<v Speaker 1>and so you just have to accept that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

606
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.130
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

607
00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>

608
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a new era now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of like looking for signals,</v>

610
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 1>which assumes that somebody is putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out signals,</v>

611
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

612
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:32.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge assumption right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that we know that there's all </v>

613
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>these planets and we're staring at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these planets,</v>

614
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.460
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to be thinking differently </v>

615
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:38.460
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.650
<v Speaker 1>we need to be prepared for what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we see something we don't </v>

617
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:40.650
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

618
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even use radio anymore.</v>

619
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

620
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Gabriel radio is dying slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 1>surely.</v>

621
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local radio is.</v>

622
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a thing of the past,</v>

623
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

624
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.190
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's really were </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaming out a large scale is a military </v>

625
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.190
<v Speaker 1>radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

626
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there'd be some kind of signal.</v>

627
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't necessarily have to be radar</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

628
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:06.721
<v Speaker 1>or radio just have to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could detect some form of anomaly </v>

629
00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:07.730
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to be artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

630
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So here's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some of the suggestions that </v>

631
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.341
<v Speaker 1>people are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Avi Loeb at Harvard talks about the </v>

632
00:22:14.341 --> 00:22:14.341
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

633
00:22:14.341 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe what you need and you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>need the sensitivity for this.</v>

634
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see like rocket engines </v>
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth between,</v>

635
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

636
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you have a plan that you have to a multi</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet civilization on,</v>

637
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>in some and you're going to see little </v>
<v Speaker 1>flares is rockets,</v>

638
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 1>decelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate back and forth.</v>

639
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>People have talked about seeing city </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>

640
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the telescopes are getting,</v>

641
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

642
00:22:31.131 --> 00:22:36.131
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building these giant telescopes </v>

643
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:38.021
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 30 meters and may be a potential </v>

644
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:38.021
<v Speaker 1>one day to see city lights.</v>

645
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>You could see city lights when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see the planet come around.</v>

646
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Like this is all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:40.330
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

648
00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we're not there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people 20 years,</v>

649
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:43.990
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

650
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:44.600
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 1>this is a long game and you got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the long game.</v>

652
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:51.751
<v Speaker 1>At some point we're gonna need to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in space that's even larger so we </v>

653
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:54.721
<v Speaker 1>can collect more light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And multi issue will also be that if we </v>

654
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 1>do see these city lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing city lights for millions of</v>

655
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

656
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 1>it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

657
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

658
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 1>planets that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

659
00:22:58.601 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a star 10 light years ago,</v>

660
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that's 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like,</v>

661
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things could still be around.</v>

662
00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a really interesting idea,</v>

663
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

664
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:10.981
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book is like how long does any </v>

666
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:10.981
<v Speaker 1>civilization last?</v>

667
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:10.981
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>

668
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:15.930
<v Speaker 1>All of this stuff is rest super relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us now because the question is what </v>

669
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 1>is the average lifetime of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization?</v>

670
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>So you might be able to see artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>from civilizations that are gone,</v>

671
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 1>like imagine of civilization covered one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its moons in,</v>

672
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.840
<v Speaker 1>in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

673
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>solar panels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

674
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The reflected light is going to show a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectral signature of the,</v>

675
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panels,</v>

676
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like they don't even have to </v>

677
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 1>necessarily be alive now that we still </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be able to see stuff from there,</v>

678
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:42.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are evidence of like artificial </v>

679
00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:42.661
<v Speaker 1>structures or something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural around them.</v>

680
00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

681
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

682
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

683
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.570
<v Speaker 1>we're about to take this step in step in</v>
<v Speaker 1>astrobiology we're,</v>

684
00:23:49.571 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>we're already running models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a Xcel biospheres,</v>

686
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:53.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're two.</v>

687
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 1>We're asking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

688
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:59.321
<v Speaker 1>what kind of chemistry can you have if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like if you have a </v>

689
00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 1>photosynthesis in s are on a planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a star that's smaller than ours,</v>

690
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.840
<v Speaker 1>that starts gonna be mostly red as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to yellow light.</v>

691
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So the light that's coming off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be different.</v>

692
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Kenya have photosynthesis in that case </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are like,</v>

693
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably could.</v>

694
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:13.661
<v Speaker 1>And what would it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're already doing the work to be </v>

695
00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:15.520
<v Speaker 1>ready for Expo biospheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exos civilizations,</v>

696
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 1>we kind of need to be prepared for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

697
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be the traces,</v>

699
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 1>what might we see from a distance from </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eco civilization.</v>

700
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to be signaling us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.350
<v Speaker 1>they're just there and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch some aspect of their being around.</v>

702
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Even if we did see rocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we did see some sort of a signature </v>

703
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.450
<v Speaker 1>from rockets going back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the w,</v>

704
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.700
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have to assume that this is a </v>

705
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>similarly aged civilization to hours.</v>

706
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if we saw something that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>

707
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years advanced,</v>

708
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>we probably wouldn't see that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably see some sort of a </v>

709
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's possible,</v>

710
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>if it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's possible.</v>

711
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

713
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 1>of course that is one of the problems is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

714
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start,</v>

715
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start pushing,</v>

716
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.720
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

718
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to be like in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years?</v>

719
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

720
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you start with what you know.</v>

721
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cool thing about the planet part </v>

722
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:10.600
<v Speaker 1>though is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:10.600
<v Speaker 1>unless they become like energy beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna have an effect on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

725
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>So looking at their planets to look for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

726
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>for spectral indications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably even after they die,</v>

727
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 1>there might even be things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

728
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>a good way to go.</v>

730
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

731
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so curious as to what we're going to</v>

732
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 1>be able to do in a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

733
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 1>years and 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

734
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Civilization does Dale around and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to not melt the earth or</v>

735
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 1>boil the oceans or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the ground we're doing.</v>

736
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

737
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.990
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of science fiction films that do</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculated what,</v>

739
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be possible in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

740
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that recent one with?</v>

741
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

742
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.490
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

743
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 1>The fuck's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mechanic.</v>

744
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one where they go through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wormholes.</v>

745
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do those movies piss you off or</v>

746
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.810
<v Speaker 1>they don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

747
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not mean but they get so of science</v>

748
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:05.870
<v Speaker 1>fiction so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do not need my science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be correct to be correct.</v>

750
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

751
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So I love the expanse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The is my favorite show ever.</v>

752
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I will talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the expanse,</v>

753
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the expanse I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

754
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

755
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>so the expanse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a series of books,</v>

756
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.530
<v Speaker 1>first of all that I think are the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction books in the last 15 </v>

757
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.471
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they made him into it and made </v>

758
00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:29.471
<v Speaker 1>it into a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

759
00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>on Saifai and then had three years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

760
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:31.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first people were like,</v>

761
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of hard to follow because,</v>

762
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of stories coming together.</v>

763
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

764
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year it got 100 percent,</v>

765
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

766
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.920
<v Speaker 1>ratings or what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rotten tomatoes,</v>

767
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 1>rotten tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent or 95 percent if </v>

768
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 1>people love Scifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancelled it,</v>

769
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then Jeff Bezos just.</v>

770
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

771
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 1>he just picked it up because people love</v>
<v Speaker 1>this show.</v>

772
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why this show is amazing,</v>

773
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

774
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes place about 200 years from now </v>

775
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and we are truly a multi planet species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Mars now has,</v>

776
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people on it and it's become its</v>

777
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 1>own political power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

778
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 1>If it's separated from the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the asteroid belt has also,</v>

779
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:13.251
<v Speaker 1>people are colonizing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living on the asteroid belt to mind </v>

780
00:27:13.251 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the belters as they call them,</v>

781
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.550
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like second class citizens who </v>

782
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:19.550
<v Speaker 1>are basically like super poor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

783
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the boot on their next by </v>

784
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 1>either earth or Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this whole interplanetary</v>

785
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of political shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just great,</v>

786
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

787
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 1>and then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enter into this,</v>

788
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 1>they discover like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call the protein molecule,</v>

789
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.050
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is basically this alien molecule </v>

791
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.190
<v Speaker 1>that was really a device that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens through our way,</v>

792
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 1>billions of years ago that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.600
<v Speaker 1>how much am I supposed to give away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

795
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

796
00:27:44.321 --> 00:27:46.020
<v Speaker 1>not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to remember.</v>

797
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

798
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.330
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

799
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 1>so that complicated so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that becomes kind of a weapon in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this political intrigue.</v>

801
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a great story to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people call it like the game of thrones </v>

802
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.431
<v Speaker 1>and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what I love about it </v>

803
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:01.431
<v Speaker 1>is that this is what it's gonna look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

804
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 1>like they get the science on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So write as much as you can,</v>

805
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

806
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in space if your rocket motors are on,</v>

807
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 1>there's gravity because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocket motors push up towards you.</v>

808
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got grabbed,</v>

809
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you can walk around when you turn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket motors off,</v>

810
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you float around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on spinning things,</v>

811
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

812
00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.500
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

814
00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 1>in this universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.790
<v Speaker 1>in this the fictional universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've taken the big asteroids and they</v>

816
00:28:21.791 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 1>followed them out and spun them up.</v>

817
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So people live on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

818
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at one point like the,</v>

819
00:28:27.501 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 1>that one of the characters that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>private eye,</v>

820
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 1>they got this great sort of film noir </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing going on and he pours a drink,</v>

821
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 1>some whiskey and the whiskey does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirals into this.</v>

822
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So they got that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Coriolis I peed my pants.</v>

823
00:28:38.881 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

824
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:41.160
<v Speaker 1>they got the coriolis effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

825
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really what it's gonna look </v>

826
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:46.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

827
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.040
<v Speaker 1>This is if you want to imagine 200 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>

828
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:52.041
<v Speaker 1>which I think is completely feasible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have millions of people living </v>

829
00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 1>in space making advances socially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

830
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

831
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are assholes to each other.</v>

832
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's only 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot to ask for.</v>

834
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how different we are from </v>

835
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 1>people that live 50 years ago.</v>

836
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that different.</v>

837
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I think we're quite a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

838
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:09.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

839
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this ability to communicate now </v>

840
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.031
<v Speaker 1>that we never did before where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an ability to say their piece about </v>

841
00:29:17.031 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 1>how they feel about how things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

842
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

843
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

844
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And that has changed a lot of things a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways,</v>

845
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed who we are.</v>

846
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think evolution,</v>

847
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's chipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be good if it,</v>

848
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things,</v>

849
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:35.151
<v Speaker 1>my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's interesting about this </v>

850
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:35.151
<v Speaker 1>fictional world too is that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate,</v>

851
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:38.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is dealing with client earth </v>

852
00:29:38.061 --> 00:29:38.061
<v Speaker 1>has like 30 billion people on it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

853
00:29:38.061 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 1>New York is halfway under water and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the story too,</v>

854
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

855
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:45.021
<v Speaker 1>so we're trying to navigate our way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through now becoming a multi planet </v>

856
00:29:45.021 --> 00:29:45.021
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

857
00:29:45.021 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

858
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:50.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a version of at least 200 years </v>

859
00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>where you can really extrapolate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and ask yourself.</v>

860
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Because that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

861
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we make it through climate change,</v>

862
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the prize at the end of the,</v>

863
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

864
00:29:57.751 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the story.</v>

865
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:00.430
<v Speaker 1>If we make it through climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

866
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>what the stuff that Elon Musk and Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bezos are doing,</v>

867
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.230
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real like this.</v>

868
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 1>This is what your number one concern is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate Change.</v>

869
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a single voter.</v>

870
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate change because it's like it is </v>

871
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:13.550
<v Speaker 1>an existential dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

872
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and because of all the writing I did for</v>
<v Speaker 1>NPR and New York Times,</v>

873
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:19.681
<v Speaker 1>I have dealt with a lot of climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change denialist men and it drives me </v>

874
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:19.681
<v Speaker 1>what is their big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big.</v>

875
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently had a discussion with someone</v>

876
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast that didn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change and it was,</v>

877
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.210
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird thing is because I kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling up all the different scientific </v>

878
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>consensus studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different studies that show that</v>

879
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 1>we were having an impact.</v>

880
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's an undeniable impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

881
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

882
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that's what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that she's really thinking</v>

884
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:47.461
<v Speaker 1>about the and the hurricane it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she really thinks about </v>

885
00:30:47.461 --> 00:30:50.941
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she just has this stance that </v>

886
00:30:50.941 --> 00:30:51.040
<v Speaker 1>she believes that that group that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of,</v>

887
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:56.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what a subscribes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an ideological aspect of it </v>

888
00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 1>where you kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a predetermined pattern that </v>

889
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to follow when you're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side,</v>

890
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to be pro life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be pro second amendment </v>

891
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 1>stuff stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:11.011
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a giant problem with our </v>

893
00:31:11.011 --> 00:31:13.321
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two groups of people that you </v>

894
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>can't like to truly be an independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker.</v>

895
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:18.541
<v Speaker 1>You're like one of these Weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often the fringe to be independent </v>

896
00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:18.541
<v Speaker 1>of either party.</v>

897
00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

898
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about science is the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of science is to be independent,</v>

899
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.050
<v Speaker 1>is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have,</v>

900
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what science is,</v>

901
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.340
<v Speaker 1>science is a way of having public </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

902
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody has their opinions,</v>

903
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:33.961
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But science is about the stuff we can </v>

904
00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:33.961
<v Speaker 1>all be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

905
00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:33.961
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

906
00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:37.631
<v Speaker 1>it's this whole process that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved over 400 years and with climate </v>

907
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:38.920
<v Speaker 1>denial man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>

908
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

909
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.580
<v Speaker 1>you want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

910
00:31:40.581 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are,</v>

911
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read a book because they'll say stuff </v>

912
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:47.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my favorite one.</v>

913
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate's always changing climate change</v>

914
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>in man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

915
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody comes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know what I want most for </v>

916
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>people I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself an evangelist of </v>

917
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love science.</v>

918
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And so if people come to me they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

919
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the climate always changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

920
00:31:58.301 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great question.</v>

921
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually know the answer to that yet.</v>

922
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It's changing but it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the timescale,</v>

923
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it changes often on million year time</v>

924
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>scales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like from the last 10,000</v>

925
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 1>years since the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was 10,000</v>

926
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:12.820
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>

927
00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Like there used to be a mile of ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>above our heads,</v>

928
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>text 10,000</v>

929
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate has been remarkably stable.</v>

930
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has been little blips in it,</v>

931
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but no major changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

932
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

933
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and I can show them the graph of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

934
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

935
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>if they're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:31.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they're asking the question </v>

937
00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:31.591
<v Speaker 1>because they want to know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>

938
00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:31.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm down to talk until the cows come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

939
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what a typical deniers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

940
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Deniers climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

941
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>But they're not interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

942
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:41.611
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only the not interested in the </v>

943
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:41.611
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just</v>

944
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:45.160
<v Speaker 2>trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real conversation because </v>

945
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a really complex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you dig an ice core and you tap down </v>

946
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:52.110
<v Speaker 2>to 50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$80,000</v>

947
00:32:52.111 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

948
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:58.091
<v Speaker 2>you see all these bizarre shifts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate that could be indicative of </v>

949
00:32:58.091 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 2>super volcanoes and asteroidal impacts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and solar flares.</v>

950
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:04.230
<v Speaker 2>A Lotta Shit happens over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a million years.</v>

951
00:33:04.231 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to</v>

952
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.280
<v Speaker 1>hang all your</v>

953
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.680
<v Speaker 2>ideas on the party's ideology and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deny all this really interesting stuff </v>

954
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

955
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 2>and all these</v>

956
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.630
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

957
00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:21.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

958
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:22.150
<v Speaker 1>you know what I try and tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

959
00:33:22.151 --> 00:33:24.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate science is like awesome.</v>

960
00:33:24.161 --> 00:33:29.161
<v Speaker 1>Like it's science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got these amazing stories to tell </v>

961
00:33:29.161 --> 00:33:29.161
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

962
00:33:29.161 --> 00:33:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth earth over the past four point</v>

963
00:33:30.461 --> 00:33:35.461
<v Speaker 1>5 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth has gone through the most </v>

964
00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:36.160
<v Speaker 1>profound changes and we've learned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you interested in that?</v>

965
00:33:36.161 --> 00:33:41.161
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically have this thing where </v>

966
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:41.161
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:41.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of this group.</v>

968
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:42.640
<v Speaker 1>And therefore have to have this opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

969
00:33:42.641 --> 00:33:43.660
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's science.</v>

970
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Science doesn't care who you voted for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

971
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

972
00:33:46.811 --> 00:33:51.811
<v Speaker 1>a rated of properties of a co two </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecule doesn't care whether you're </v>

973
00:33:51.811 --> 00:33:54.931
<v Speaker 1>wearing a blue tie or a red tie and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that people can't make that </v>

974
00:33:54.931 --> 00:33:54.931
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the real problem.</v>

975
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Once you go down this slippery road of </v>
<v Speaker 1>denying,</v>

976
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

977
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.790
<v Speaker 1>that kind of science I hate man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all a hoax.</v>

978
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:06.661
<v Speaker 1>America's prosperity and our safety has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been built on science over the last 200 </v>

980
00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

981
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you start to erode the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just like call one group of </v>

982
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Geoscientists Hucksters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

983
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And so they're only doing for learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have it slowly.</v>

984
00:34:14.591 --> 00:34:16.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else to the point where like,</v>

985
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:21.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China will be happy to eat our lunch </v>

986
00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:21.721
<v Speaker 1>when it comes scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese pumping,</v>

987
00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:22.720
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of money into science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing this.</v>

988
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:34:23.591 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're limiting.</v>

990
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other thing that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bums me out.</v>

991
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Science is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a lunch buffet.</v>

992
00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:30.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be like,</v>

993
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I have some of those antibiotics?</v>

994
00:34:32.501 --> 00:34:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I Love Antibiotics and Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell phone's great.</v>

995
00:34:34.331 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to fly in a plane,</v>

996
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but climate change is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

997
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

998
00:34:39.641 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 1>either you accept that you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific society.</v>

999
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:44.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean like your slave actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>adhere to anything.</v>

1000
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out in the journal it </v>

1001
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:49.630
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1002
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.991
<v Speaker 1>either you adhere to the idea that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>method has produced miracles for us or </v>

1003
00:34:51.991 --> 00:34:53.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't give me the cell phone back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1004
00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the terrific</v>

1005
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.920
<v Speaker 2>method is what has established the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual real facts of how things interact</v>

1006
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:06.311
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's allowed us to create </v>

1007
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:06.311
<v Speaker 2>technology and I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1008
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 2>they split that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They focus on the technology and </v>

1009
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more important than their eyes.</v>

1010
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1011
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:17.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of the environment or </v>

1012
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

1013
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the big hope is that we're going</v>

1014
00:35:20.471 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>to figure it out and I'm hopeful of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1015
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:27.701
<v Speaker 2>is that we're going to figure out some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to extract carbon from the </v>

1016
00:35:27.701 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere with devices or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous,</v>

1017
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:34.150
<v Speaker 2>like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was a working </v>

1018
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.581
<v Speaker 2>prototype or is just a concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was an enormous building that </v>

1019
00:35:36.581 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>was really an air filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other starting to look</v>

1020
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:43.070
<v Speaker 3>at carbon capture again with places like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hong Kong and places where they have </v>

1021
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.180
<v Speaker 3>terrible Beijing and they have terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible pollution and more importantly </v>

1022
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.111
<v Speaker 3>particulates in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just a a like a carbon </v>

1023
00:35:51.111 --> 00:35:55.581
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they have shit in there air </v>

1024
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:55.581
<v Speaker 3>that they're breathing in your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

1025
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:56.120
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 3>I went to Mexico City a couple years </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1027
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I've been there twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I went there for a UFC and when we </v>

1028
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.410
<v Speaker 3>were flying in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took photos and I put them on my </v>

1029
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.410
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you find those.</v>

1030
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.570
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

1031
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a creepy animal is the </v>

1032
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.101
<v Speaker 3>human?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human is capable of burning smoke </v>

1033
00:36:16.101 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 3>into the very air that we need to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the lungs to keep our body a lot.</v>

1034
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it so bad.</v>

1035
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.170
<v Speaker 3>People have never been to Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a stunner,</v>

1036
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fucking head was killing me after two</v>

1037
00:36:27.511 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 3>days there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1038
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 3>well that's what like with the Beijing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they had the Olympics,</v>

1039
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:31.040
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to like,</v>

1040
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to stop all industrial </v>

1041
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the month,</v>

1042
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>La used to look like this right before </v>

1043
00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 3>the clean air act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la would have,</v>

1044
00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote Mexico's La on steroids.</v>

1045
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Mexico City's early on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so dark,</v>

1046
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1047
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole question of what we'll do,</v>

1048
00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 1>like this brings us back to the aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1049
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 1>What's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

1050
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:50.670
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:52.440
<v Speaker 1>we're not the first time this has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1052
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.060
<v Speaker 1>It pretty much if you build the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

1053
00:36:55.061 --> 00:37:00.061
<v Speaker 1>anybody who builds the civilization like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done is going to trigger climate </v>

1054
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.061
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1055
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's kind of unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1056
00:37:00.911 --> 00:37:02.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the denier thing.</v>

1057
00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I'm trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is flip the script,</v>

1058
00:37:04.451 --> 00:37:05.860
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you talked to climate denialists</v>

1059
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same fricking set of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>

1060
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man Dude,</v>

1061
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.730
<v Speaker 1>we've been here before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1062
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the questions will be answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to like flip it to show </v>

1063
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 1>that like the whole question of did we </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the climate?</v>

1064
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody focused on did we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did we not,</v>

1065
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know from when you take the </v>

1066
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.960
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>light your view,</v>

1067
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.850
<v Speaker 1>then what you realize is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you expect?</v>

1068
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Like we built a world girdling </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization that uses a quarter almost </v>

1069
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 1>of all the energy the biosphere uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1070
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

1071
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day the biosphere has like,</v>

1072
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:37.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 terawatts of energy that it's </v>

1073
00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 1>producing and sugars we use about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of that.</v>

1074
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you expect there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an impact,</v>

1075
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this changes the whole way we look </v>

1076
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.430
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to argue about like,</v>

1077
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 1>did we or didn't we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we did.</v>

1078
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when you reach this</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1079
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:51.660
<v Speaker 1>in the book that I'm trying to argue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

1081
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and it pushes back against the deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like what climate deniers are human </v>

1082
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.230
<v Speaker 1>haters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 1>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>we did this amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We changed the atmosphere of an entire </v>

1085
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1086
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Climate change shows on one level how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fricking awesome we are.</v>

1087
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far we've gotten and this,</v>

1088
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.040
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:09.800
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 1>species doing this again and again </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the universe,</v>

1091
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 1>this shows that we've reached a level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1092
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've leveled up,</v>

1093
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't play a lot of video games,</v>

1094
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:22.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that whole thing when you level </v>

1095
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:22.341
<v Speaker 1>up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the,</v>

1096
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:22.341
<v Speaker 1>the sniper rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've leveled up.</v>

1097
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And so now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we smart enough,</v>

1098
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what we've done and make the </v>

1099
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 1>right choices because that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is going to be.</v>

1100
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.471
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be species that trigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is gonna happen all the </v>

1101
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:33.471
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some are going to be like,</v>

1102
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to do something right.</v>

1103
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And they'll make the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be able to work it out,</v>

1104
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>get it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other ones,</v>

1105
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to end up in the cosmic </v>

1106
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>waste pile.</v>

1107
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>So we're like cosmic teenagers and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're a teenager and you're,</v>

1108
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1109
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to drive,</v>

1110
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you figure it out,</v>

1111
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:50.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either you're drinking and you're </v>

1112
00:38:50.941 --> 00:38:52.201
<v Speaker 1>partying and drive the car off a cliff </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you figure out how to handle your </v>

1113
00:38:52.201 --> 00:38:52.201
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's us now,</v>

1114
00:38:52.201 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1115
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1116
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1117
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a fundamental,</v>

1118
00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.080
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problem with the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach ideas and uh,</v>

1119
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier about right versus</v>

1120
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 1>left or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican versus Democrat,</v>

1121
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking of the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of arguing for,</v>

1122
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.310
<v Speaker 1>against the possibility that climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change is a human caused thing.</v>

1123
00:39:12.311 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1124
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 1>They just want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1125
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.220
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what their side to be,</v>

1126
00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 1>right want their site to be.</v>

1127
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1128
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1129
00:39:18.111 --> 00:39:23.111
<v Speaker 1>what bums me out is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the consequences of that for </v>

1130
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the both the American enterprise and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human enterprise,</v>

1131
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1132
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1133
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1134
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 1>if you keep calling one branch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science a hoax,</v>

1135
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 1>then what's to say the other branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1136
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just,</v>

1137
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:38.911
<v Speaker 1>you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rolling down this slippery slope </v>

1138
00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:38.911
<v Speaker 1>where like the other countries you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1139
00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 1>So most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

1140
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:44.911
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prizes Americans have one where </v>

1141
00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:47.611
<v Speaker 1>people from other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came here to do their science </v>

1142
00:39:47.611 --> 00:39:47.611
<v Speaker 1>because we had the best scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

1143
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.870
<v Speaker 1>The next generation will just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>

1144
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 1>They'll go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1145
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1146
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 1>there's that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other part it's like,</v>

1147
00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just science.</v>

1148
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care about your political </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and you know,</v>

1149
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:03.901
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair to use the cell phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the antibiotics and then turn </v>

1150
00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 1>around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly treat this thing as if</v>

1151
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>it was another thing in your bucket of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

1152
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I think also people think if you somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another compromise industry's ability</v>

1153
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.800
<v Speaker 1>to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to kill jobs and </v>

1154
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna damage the economy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more important.</v>

1155
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's the exact opposite.</v>

1156
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people really saw,</v>

1157
00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1158
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like I'm saying,</v>

1160
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 1>climate change shows how powerful people</v>
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

1161
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It also shows how powerful are our </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

1162
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this by,</v>

1163
00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:36.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building businesses by building </v>

1164
00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:38.731
<v Speaker 1>enterprise bi and we built this world </v>
<v Speaker 1>girdling machine of civilization and it,</v>

1165
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet actually noticed.</v>

1166
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like that term world girdling</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>

1167
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it gives me the hurdle of wrapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>around think it's because it's from like</v>

1168
00:40:48.981 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 1>a Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from a Caesar or something.</v>

1169
00:40:52.631 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it wasn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the idea that like,</v>

1170
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation trilogy,</v>

1171
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the Isaac Yasmin Off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:02.461
<v Speaker 1>classic science fiction thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's the city of the planet of </v>

1173
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:02.461
<v Speaker 1>trend toward which is the center of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1174
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Galactic Empire.</v>

1175
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the whole planet has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in city.</v>

1177
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other planet,</v>

1178
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you got to go down to like 500 levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you get to the surface.</v>

1179
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 1>So that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1180
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 1>what I like about it is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1181
00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done something,</v>

1182
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of covered the planet in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our effect,</v>

1183
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered the planet in our enterprise.</v>

1184
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So this issue of business is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1185
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a place I can stand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rochester,</v>

1186
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I did this for MPR and there's the Erie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canal.</v>

1187
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I can stand right on the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Erie Canal.</v>

1188
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a train tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the tracks was laid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tracks laid back and you know,</v>

1190
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 1>the original line back in the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever seventies.</v>

1191
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a highway and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport right over there for </v>

1192
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 1>different infrastructures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.750
<v Speaker 1>which he took huge amounts of money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build what of which we don't even use </v>

1194
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.750
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1195
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of building on an </v>

1196
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will not be carbon polluting,</v>

1197
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:54.120
<v Speaker 1>will not trigger climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did,</v>

1198
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:59.170
<v Speaker 1>this is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that there's going to be </v>

1199
00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.390
<v Speaker 1>more jobs that come out of this than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever come out of fossil fuels,</v>

1200
00:42:00.391 --> 00:42:05.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a big deal for human beings </v>

1201
00:42:05.391 --> 00:42:08.681
<v Speaker 1>because that's what we do to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructures and there will be a lot </v>

1202
00:42:08.681 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 1>of wealth generated by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 1>just like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1204
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 1>when we switched to the trains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1205
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>where's the argument coming that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are people that just adopt</v>

1206
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:21.071
<v Speaker 1>the party line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party line that human climate's </v>

1207
00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 1>always changed and human beings barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected.</v>

1208
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something to concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1209
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Where's that coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1210
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1211
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 1>the gradual political polo polarization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything,</v>

1212
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you look at,</v>

1213
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1214
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 1>we're now at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it 30 year anniversary of Jim </v>

1215
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Hansen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the famous climate scientist </v>

1216
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.170
<v Speaker 1>giving his testimony in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress in 1988 a hot,</v>

1217
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.170
<v Speaker 1>sweltering summer day.</v>

1218
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 1>We said climate change is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

1219
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that made news everywhere.</v>

1220
00:42:44.501 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first public awakening </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was happening.</v>

1221
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the first Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

1222
00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1223
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 1>we're ready to do something about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1224
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 1>We can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1225
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it just gradually over time,</v>

1226
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>as the whole political polarization </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing happened,</v>

1227
00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.660
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1228
00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 1>the very purposeful denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1229
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 1>They took a page out of the cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies for years,</v>

1230
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:04.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes were like,</v>

1231
00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 1>cigarette companies are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1232
00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were purposefully,</v>

1233
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 1>the other people had money invested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1234
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a documentary that,</v>

1235
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that goes into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of that merchants of </v>

1236
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merchants of doubt.</v>

1237
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1238
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the documentary is really good.</v>

1239
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It was purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1240
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also confusing.</v>

1241
00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing that?</v>

1242
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Like who's paying them to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the cigarette companies </v>

1243
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.681
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be paying the same people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put doubt into the idea that cigarettes </v>

1244
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:38.120
<v Speaker 1>are addictive or cigarettes caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

1245
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And this is what had been done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

1246
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people are involved in doing it</v>

1247
00:43:42.591 --> 00:43:44.030
<v Speaker 1>with climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

1248
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1249
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:50.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time I wrote a piece for the NPR </v>

1250
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:50.130
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of positive about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1251
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 1>we can switch infrastructure like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

1252
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And some guy wrote me back very angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

1253
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proven reserves,</v>

1254
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff,</v>

1255
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>the oil that's in the ground has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>

1256
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 1>has a monetary value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1257
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in there in the oil companies,</v>

1258
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.420
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:08.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their bank accounts of one point </v>

1260
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.430
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000,000.</v>

1261
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1262
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have gone to war for a lot less </v>

1263
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>than one point $5,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1264
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1265
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.820
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to really be like,</v>

1266
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't burn that,</v>

1267
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to leave that in the </v>

1268
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's likely their bank accounts.</v>

1269
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like zero pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I don't.</v>

1270
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's those industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of it.</v>

1271
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 1>And then it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get linked to other things and then </v>

1272
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 1>it becomes this sort of like mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1273
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the political poll.</v>

1274
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 1>They use political polarization to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1275
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of make this happen.</v>

1276
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't doing this.</v>

1277
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the important thing.</v>

1278
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>

1279
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 1>There's always a little bit of climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>denial going on,</v>

1280
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but we're the only country that's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

1281
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>because we're the only ones who are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the Paris accord.</v>

1282
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the</v>

1283
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 2>weirdest things about this right left </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1284
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 2>The left is always supporting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

1285
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.050
<v Speaker 2>The left is all about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left is about clean air and</v>

1286
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water.</v>

1287
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 1>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

1288
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is very strange.</v>

1289
00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

1290
00:44:58.871 --> 00:44:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1291
00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I have issues with environmental lists </v>
<v Speaker 1>too because,</v>

1292
00:45:03.131 --> 00:45:08.131
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of your shows I was </v>

1293
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:08.131
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1294
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:08.131
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of Eco Bros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1295
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:08.131
<v Speaker 1>And you get ECO Brode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

1296
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:09.820
<v Speaker 1>and I noticed I have a piece in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times today,</v>

1297
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.620
<v Speaker 1>an op ed where I'm basically saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1298
00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:13.090
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet's going to be fine.</v>

1299
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1300
00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:18.541
<v Speaker 1>long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we can throw at the </v>

1301
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:18.541
<v Speaker 1>biosphere that is going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in.</v>

1302
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:18.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not about saving the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Earth.</v>

1303
00:45:18.941 --> 00:45:21.050
<v Speaker 1>He's not a fuzzy little bunny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1304
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.950
<v Speaker 1>the planet is powerful and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>about saving us.</v>

1305
00:45:23.951 --> 00:45:28.951
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is going to be all kinds of ethical </v>

1306
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:28.951
<v Speaker 1>choices that go on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1307
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:31.180
<v Speaker 1>the polar bears may not be able to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with us on the ride here.</v>

1308
00:45:31.181 --> 00:45:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a healthy biosphere with,</v>

1309
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of biodiversity,</v>

1310
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of it and we're going to have</v>

1311
00:45:37.031 --> 00:45:42.031
<v Speaker 1>an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as no impact and </v>

1312
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:42.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>already I'm getting ECO brode people,</v>

1313
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:43.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about life.</v>

1314
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1315
00:45:44.891 --> 00:45:46.240
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put it in the thing.</v>

1316
00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I said we need to be wise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>

1317
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>

1318
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:49.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have</v>

1319
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 2>convening opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

1320
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:56.770
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with when you start talking </v>

1321
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>with people about really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

1322
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we were talking about earlier,</v>

1323
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 2>they want to be right and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be on the sides.</v>

1324
00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>It's righteous and with virtue in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics,</v>

1325
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find anything that you disagree,</v>

1326
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that they disagree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying they don't ask you </v>

1327
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.710
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't go.</v>

1328
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the implications are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you,</v>

1329
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:20.841
<v Speaker 2>how do we minimize the effects and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative consequences of are they just </v>

1330
00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 2>immediately want to say you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>insensitive.</v>

1331
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 2>You are an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the problem.</v>

1332
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1333
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know my way around that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the whole book is about is </v>

1334
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.550
<v Speaker 1>to like when you've got a polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1335
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're either this or you're that.</v>

1336
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 1>The thing that this is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical idea is to go orthogonal.</v>

1337
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>

1338
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.600
<v Speaker 1>because you know it's a line basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1339
00:46:40.601 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 1>You're either on this side or that side </v>
<v Speaker 1>go 90 degrees to it.</v>

1340
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in a whole new space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're up and down to the left and.</v>

1341
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1342
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:51.711
<v Speaker 1>And now like the questions that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in like revolutions in </v>

1343
00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:51.711
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1344
00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:56.061
<v Speaker 1>So you look at Einstein and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened when Einstein came up with a </v>

1345
00:46:56.061 --> 00:46:56.061
<v Speaker 1>relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody at the time was like,</v>

1346
00:46:56.061 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1347
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 1>they were all concerned what they call </v>
<v Speaker 1>the luminaire forest,</v>

1348
00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:59.320
<v Speaker 1>ether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1349
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:04.340
<v Speaker 1>light needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to wave and everybody thought it </v>

1350
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:04.340
<v Speaker 1>needed something to propagate through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right radio way or,</v>

1351
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waterways go through water,</v>

1352
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave go through air.</v>

1353
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing was about this ether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Luminous Air Easter is,</v>

1354
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.980
<v Speaker 1>this exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not exist,</v>

1355
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I was like,</v>

1356
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:17.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really interested in that </v>

1357
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:17.091
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to do it?</v>

1358
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:17.091
<v Speaker 1>He just changed the whole thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

1359
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's two new ideas.</v>

1360
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>They have nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>luminous every either.</v>

1361
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And like all the old questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the old battles kind of just fell </v>

1362
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>away and they didn't even make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1363
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm trying to do in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and say,</v>

1364
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:31.611
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at climate change as a </v>

1365
00:47:31.611 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 1>planetary transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a predictable planetary transition,</v>

1366
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of environmentalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus business interests.</v>

1367
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1368
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1369
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Republicans versus Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't,</v>

1370
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even relevant anymore.</v>

1371
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 1>What matters is that this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1372
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>We should have expected it to happen.</v>

1373
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:51.390
<v Speaker 1>And now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we become a cosmic winter or cosmic </v>

1374
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 1>loser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to think about the biosphere</v>

1375
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:56.551
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to think about our place in the </v>

1376
00:47:56.551 --> 00:47:56.551
<v Speaker 1>biosphere differently and the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

1377
00:47:56.551 --> 00:48:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know sometimes with climate change </v>

1378
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.741
<v Speaker 1>deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw this stuff at them and it's </v>

1379
00:48:01.741 --> 00:48:03.691
<v Speaker 1>really kind of fun to watch and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're expecting me to say like </v>

1380
00:48:03.691 --> 00:48:03.691
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>B and c and they've got d,</v>

1381
00:48:03.691 --> 00:48:05.590
<v Speaker 1>e and F and response and I throw this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff out them and they're just like,</v>

1382
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>

1383
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Just a fight with climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's true.</v>

1384
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.180
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1385
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was it that was on the podcast?</v>

1386
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:17.671
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilization techniques and that this </v>

1387
00:48:17.671 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 2>is probably the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it boy?</v>

1388
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

1389
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.480
<v Speaker 2>what people are really worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1390
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:29.510
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to people that understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of the human race and the </v>

1391
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.021
<v Speaker 2>history of the earth is climate cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the climate cooling is far more </v>

1392
00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:34.820
<v Speaker 2>terrifying than climate warming because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we go into a giant ice age,</v>

1393
00:48:34.821 --> 00:48:39.821
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean way more people are gonna die a </v>

1394
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 2>terrible loss of resources and it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating to the human race that is.</v>

1395
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that something that you agree with?</v>

1396
00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1397
00:48:47.281 --> 00:48:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's true.</v>

1398
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And here's something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of overdue for an ice age.</v>

1399
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was the thing in the seventies</v>

1400
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 2>there were saying that we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>verge of.</v>

1401
00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that there was just a couple of </v>

1402
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.271
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that whole thing because that's </v>

1403
00:49:03.271 --> 00:49:03.271
<v Speaker 1>often something that climate deniers </v>
<v Speaker 1>will throw at you in the seventies,</v>

1404
00:49:03.271 --> 00:49:03.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1405
00:49:03.271 --> 00:49:07.591
<v Speaker 1>there was like one or two guys who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then it got picked up on the </v>

1406
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:10.201
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the climate community at that time </v>

1407
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:10.201
<v Speaker 1>was not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1408
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:10.201
<v Speaker 1>it's cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1409
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:13.890
<v Speaker 1>But here's the interesting thing for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the fits into this whole idea is </v>

1410
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 1>that like we're holding off an ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there may never be.</v>

1411
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 1>If human humanity is successful and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate the Anthropocene,</v>

1412
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:23.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that term the anthropocene that we've </v>

1413
00:49:23.821 --> 00:49:25.141
<v Speaker 1>now entered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've now entered the human dominated </v>

1414
00:49:25.141 --> 00:49:25.141
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been for the last 10,000</v>

1415
00:49:25.141 --> 00:49:29.251
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The geological epoch has been what they </v>

1416
00:49:29.251 --> 00:49:30.781
<v Speaker 1>called the Holocene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all of human civilization </v>

1417
00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:30.781
<v Speaker 1>happened in the whole scene.</v>

1418
00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:30.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty warm.</v>

1419
00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:31.970
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moist,</v>

1420
00:49:31.971 --> 00:49:36.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's not locked up in ice and </v>

1421
00:49:36.971 --> 00:49:36.971
<v Speaker 1>it's an inter glacial period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we weren't around,</v>

1422
00:49:36.971 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another thousand,</v>

1423
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 1>3000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years would be another ice age.</v>

1424
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.720
<v Speaker 1>But the anthropocene that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggering could hold off ice ages </v>

1425
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.450
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1426
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:51.451
<v Speaker 1>As long as we're around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be another ice age because </v>

1427
00:49:51.451 --> 00:49:54.121
<v Speaker 1>we've already added enough warmth to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet that it overcomes the effects </v>

1428
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:56.971
<v Speaker 1>that trigger an ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what are the ethical </v>

1429
00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:56.971
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I try and tell the,</v>

1430
00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environmentalists like,</v>

1431
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:02.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this image like oh we got to </v>

1432
00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:04.471
<v Speaker 1>save the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're thinking of like the whole </v>

1433
00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:04.471
<v Speaker 1>scene and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1434
00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet even with us,</v>

1435
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:10.291
<v Speaker 1>even if we successfully keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity rich and it's not going to </v>

1436
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>be the earth we started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1437
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.340
<v Speaker 1>because we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1438
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:16.600
<v Speaker 1>What about the species that never form </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we held off the ice age.</v>

1439
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean forever.</v>

1440
00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Like what about the ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility though?</v>

1441
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.180
<v Speaker 1>So like it opens for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a long equation though,</v>

1442
00:50:23.181 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1443
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.130
<v Speaker 1>in what way?</v>

1444
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Try to contemplate what would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed</v>

1445
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>if we allow the earth to cool and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for allowing the earth to</v>

1446
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 1>cool so that the potential for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>species to advance.</v>

1447
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck those pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep,</v>

1448
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 1>let's keep this place warm so we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

1449
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I'm saying,</v>

1450
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I'm raising that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1451
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm raising that because we don't.</v>

1452
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you get sometimes when the </v>

1453
00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 1>environmental movement is this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the polar bear,</v>

1454
00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 1>the polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what I'm trying to say,</v>

1455
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.170
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love polar bears.</v>

1456
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Kind of funny that polar bears always </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because polar bears will rip your </v>

1457
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 1>head off and drink your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

1458
00:50:58.251 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 1>then one of the rare bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't need anything but me.</v>

1459
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1460
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's so funny that we're like,</v>

1461
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin is a biologist,</v>

1462
00:51:05.751 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 1>and he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get polar bear babies,</v>

1463
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.980
<v Speaker 1>like right out of the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said they're like the,</v>

1464
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>like the alien from the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest burster steam.</v>

1465
00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 1>He said that literally like right out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the womb,</v>

1466
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 1>they're looking to kill and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1467
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so good.</v>

1468
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 1>That is a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people have tamed them and Fed</v>

1469
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:27.110
<v Speaker 1>them to the point where they don't in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head off.</v>

1470
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a fucking predatory enormous </v>

1471
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:32.140
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1472
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:32.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm raising that point to say like,</v>

1473
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing we're going through now is a,</v>

1474
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it's an epic making planetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>

1475
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 1>We were part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1476
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not we're still part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question whether or not we're</v>

1477
00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 1>still part of it a thousand years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1478
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the big issue.</v>

1479
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 1>there are ethical issues about the polar</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>

1481
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are also ethical issue.</v>

1482
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>We can't just return the earth to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine state.</v>

1483
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.880
<v Speaker 1>We're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 7 billion of us,</v>

1484
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to,</v>

1485
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to understand like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this deeper ethical question </v>

1486
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.431
<v Speaker 1>about what is an earth look like that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been changed by us that's healthy but </v>

1487
00:52:06.431 --> 00:52:06.431
<v Speaker 1>still has us on it.</v>

1488
00:52:06.431 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It may not have polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1489
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it may have rich phyto plankton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may be a very species diverse,</v>

1491
00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but some of the species may not come </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>

1492
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.360
<v Speaker 1>So like we can't this sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

1493
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:22.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pristine or if there is no more </v>

1494
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.390
<v Speaker 1>pristine earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1495
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been changing the earth since we </v>

1496
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 1>were here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like how do we have a healthy,</v>

1497
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.471
<v Speaker 1>a rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy biosphere with us and our </v>

1498
00:52:29.471 --> 00:52:31.931
<v Speaker 1>civilization still in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about things that have </v>

1499
00:52:31.931 --> 00:52:35.651
<v Speaker 1>gone extinct in the past and more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of everything that's ever </v>

1500
00:52:35.651 --> 00:52:37.880
<v Speaker 1>existed is extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is we didn't know then.</v>

1501
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have a,</v>

1502
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a checklist like,</v>

1503
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotted owl,</v>

1504
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:45.170
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

1505
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 1>No tree frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check.</v>

1506
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we do.</v>

1507
00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And when one goes away we kind of freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1508
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1509
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:51.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1510
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have compassion for life </v>

1511
00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:56.530
<v Speaker 1>because we're part of it without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

1512
00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we end up with a,</v>

1513
00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>as a Gavin Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine calls economic.</v>

1514
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:00.740
<v Speaker 1>We have ecological hooliganism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1515
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>We just do crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just dumping Shit into rivers.</v>

1516
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1517
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1518
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1519
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:08.330
<v Speaker 1>when in my talks on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show like the polar bear,</v>

1520
00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the lonely polar bear on the island and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1521
00:53:10.811 --> 00:53:12.770
<v Speaker 1>like all you have once really bummed out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1522
00:53:12.771 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll show like a velociraptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1523
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.890
<v Speaker 1>You know who's crying for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>velociraptor species come and go.</v>

1524
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1525
00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>and the earth goes to these huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitions.</v>

1526
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying be like don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those species,</v>

1527
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but you got to have bigger picture with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us in it.</v>

1528
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1529
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:30.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environmental movements.</v>

1530
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the,</v>

1531
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 1>it gets framed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the environment in which </v>

1532
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the way we talk about climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of ourselves as being a plague,</v>

1533
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human beings,</v>

1534
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 1>we suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1535
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only story.</v>

1536
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have two stories.</v>

1537
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening or we suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my whole thing is like,</v>

1538
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that is the raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is that story wrong,</v>

1539
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it's unhelpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1540
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 1>we are what the biosphere is doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1541
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:58.370
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago it was grasslands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grasslands were a new innovation and </v>

1542
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they changed the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of grass,</v>

1543
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biosphere evolved,</v>

1544
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 1>grasslands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they swept across the planet.</v>

1545
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 1>They changed how the planet works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the earth moved on with it.</v>

1546
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Went onto the new experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are what the were exactly that we are</v>

1547
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:14.931
<v Speaker 1>like the dinosaurs or the grasslands or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue green algae that created the </v>

1548
00:54:14.931 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 1>oxygen atmosphere and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1549
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:17.270
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1550
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between a city in </v>

1551
00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:22.340
<v Speaker 1>a forest on some biospheric level.</v>

1552
00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:26.570
<v Speaker 1>We don't suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is whether we're smart </v>

1553
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.731
<v Speaker 1>enough to still be part of what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the biosphere is using us to </v>

1554
00:54:28.731 --> 00:54:28.731
<v Speaker 1>trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1555
00:54:28.731 --> 00:54:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on the </v>

1556
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction of extinct animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>through genetic cloning?</v>

1557
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I watched her risk park whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about doing like with William </v>

1559
00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 1>mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1560
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:47.090
<v Speaker 1>This is a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something I know the close ancestor of </v>

1561
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.750
<v Speaker 1>the woolly mammoth is still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'd be down for seeing in my,</v>

1562
00:54:50.751 --> 00:54:51.220
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

1563
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 1>the science museum in Rochester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a woolly mammoth that they </v>

1564
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 1>found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1565
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes looking at anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that giant hairy ass elephant man.</v>

1566
00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And it was walking around right in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you do with it,</v>

1568
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to reintroduce it into the </v>

1569
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 1>biosphere could be a little dangerous.</v>

1570
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

1571
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is a,</v>

1572
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.230
<v Speaker 1>this is something I like say climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change is not our fault.</v>

1573
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1574
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>we found fossil fuels and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>

1575
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were just a continuation of </v>

1576
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 1>what we'd always done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1577
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And so we inadvertently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change was a mistake,</v>

1578
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1579
00:55:22.591 --> 00:55:24.540
<v Speaker 1>if we don't do something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our fault,</v>

1580
00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1581
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:30.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to be really careful </v>

1582
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:30.020
<v Speaker 1>about unintended consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1583
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is my same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1584
00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:31.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with geoengineering.</v>

1585
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 1>People talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1586
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1587
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 1>put a part of particulates in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere to make it more reflective.</v>

1588
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1589
00:55:37.621 --> 00:55:38.440
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we triggered the whole,</v>

1590
00:55:38.441 --> 00:55:40.360
<v Speaker 1>we triggered a climate change because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1591
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.380
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what the consequences </v>

1592
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.380
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

1593
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.380
<v Speaker 1>We put those articles up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we get them out,</v>

1594
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.520
<v Speaker 1>get them out with a net?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1595
00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:46.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1596
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.690
<v Speaker 1>They'll reign down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to keep putting them in.</v>

1597
00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep putting them in.</v>

1598
00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:55.461
<v Speaker 1>So what happens if like one nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>decides they don't want to do it </v>

1599
00:55:55.461 --> 00:55:55.461
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1600
00:55:55.461 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and there the whole thing falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now suddenly are,</v>

1601
00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna get massive changes and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything like that,</v>

1602
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 1>like why don't we just work on Matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>using fossil fuels?</v>

1603
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:07.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the hardest solution that's got </v>

1604
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the most uncertainty as opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler solution,</v>

1605
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 1>which just means building a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>

1606
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well especially in California.</v>

1607
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 1>places ever to not see solar power when </v>

1608
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never rained.</v>

1609
00:56:17.191 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Should be everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1610
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Most things should be run on solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1611
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Why not man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got solar and so efficient now.</v>

1612
00:56:23.151 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Like it's also very difficult to get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and running.</v>

1613
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend of mine who had his </v>
<v Speaker 1>done for four or five months before he </v>

1614
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:35.641
<v Speaker 1>got approved because he said they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it difficult for you.</v>

1615
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy to be on solar power and </v>

1616
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.910
<v Speaker 1>not be on the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1617
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are all the kinds of things</v>

1618
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to have to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopeful people are like,</v>

1619
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:45.300
<v Speaker 1>are you hopeful or not hopeful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

1620
00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean I ran these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did these models.</v>

1621
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:52.261
<v Speaker 1>One of the pieces of research we did was</v>
<v Speaker 1>we modeled planets and civilizations </v>

1622
00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:52.261
<v Speaker 1>like alien civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1623
00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a simple mathematical model </v>

1624
00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.430
<v Speaker 1>about how a civilization will use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet's resources to make more babies </v>

1625
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.060
<v Speaker 1>alien babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how the,</v>

1626
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by using those resources you feedback on</v>

1627
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

1628
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we wanted to do was we </v>

1629
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 1>wanted to model the possible outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the generic outcome,</v>

1630
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've got 100,000</v>

1631
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 1>civilizations all being born in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different places,</v>

1632
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>in general what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we found is like basically four</v>

1634
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 1>different possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was good news,</v>

1635
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:20.560
<v Speaker 1>like in these models there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 1>the population shoots up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet's temperature shoots up,</v>

1637
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 1>but they come to a nice steady state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1638
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1639
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 1>the population stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's good.</v>

1640
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So they're in those models was hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also saw die off.</v>

1641
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 1>We're like the population skyrockets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1642
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:40.530
<v Speaker 1>they overshoot the carrying capacity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their planet and then you get something </v>

1643
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:40.530
<v Speaker 1>like 70 percent of the population died </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1644
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 1>seven out of every 10 people you know is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>

1646
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you come to a steady state so </v>

1647
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 1>low maybe if you can survive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster you can,</v>

1648
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you're still there.</v>

1649
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.400
<v Speaker 1>But we also problem with survivor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disasters,</v>

1650
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 1>how much of the information gets her </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1651
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:58.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think about if you killing </v>

1652
00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:58.460
<v Speaker 1>seven out of 10 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those seven people,</v>

1653
00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:58.830
<v Speaker 1>the ones who know how to make cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

1654
00:57:58.831 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1655
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:00.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a dark age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1656
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:05.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to the dark age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I went to </v>

1657
00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Europe and I smelled it was Roman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1658
00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>the aqueducts man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like five stories tall carrying water,</v>

1659
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the 918 nobody knew how they got </v>

1660
00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 1>built a few of those dips in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

1661
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not clear,</v>

1662
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 1>especially with the society as complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>as ours,</v>

1663
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the food doesn't arrive in my grocery</v>

1664
00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>

1665
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1666
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>

1667
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:27.030
<v Speaker 1>not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not enough to keep you alive for a </v>

1668
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.030
<v Speaker 1>complex civilization like ours.</v>

1669
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't go extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not be able to have this kind of</v>

1670
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we did find collapse.</v>

1671
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>We did find complete extinction curves </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well where,</v>

1672
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population went way up and then </v>

1673
00:58:40.441 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped like a stone and wood even we've</v>

1674
00:58:40.441 --> 00:58:41.830
<v Speaker 1>and found those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built into the model as a possibility</v>

1675
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:46.831
<v Speaker 1>for the civilization to switch from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high impact resource to a low impact </v>

1676
00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:47.500
<v Speaker 1>resource like fossil to solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes because you know,</v>

1677
00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 1>planets have minds of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 1>and there's an internal dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planets and you push them far enough</v>

1679
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 1>and there's going to roll off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have ones where the population </v>

1680
00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.751
<v Speaker 1>went way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made the switch and then the </v>

1681
00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:00.751
<v Speaker 1>population started to come down on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1682
00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:04.261
<v Speaker 1>Started to cool down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you factor in random geological </v>

1683
00:59:04.261 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>events?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Random solar events,</v>

1684
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>random.</v>

1685
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:12.750
<v Speaker 1>This was really all about just planet a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and it's feedback on the </v>

1686
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.750
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>

1687
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:17.251
<v Speaker 1>we could build models like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be one of the major issues </v>

1688
00:59:17.251 --> 00:59:20.971
<v Speaker 1>with any advanced civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of time before something </v>

1689
00:59:20.971 --> 00:59:20.971
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1690
00:59:20.971 --> 00:59:21.970
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1691
00:59:21.971 --> 00:59:26.971
<v Speaker 1>we know that Mars has been hit before we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go or spin hit the moon's been head </v>

1692
00:59:26.971 --> 00:59:30.671
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the moon is one of our best </v>

1693
00:59:30.671 --> 00:59:33.190
<v Speaker 1>examples would just look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see craters everywhere because it </v>

1694
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:36.761
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have an environment or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere on the moon was built by a </v>

1695
00:59:36.761 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 1>huge impact between earth and Mars on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

1696
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:37.870
<v Speaker 1>like bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:39.110
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the planet's </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

1698
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:40.310
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those happen all the time.</v>

1699
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I think if you get advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1700
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.000
<v Speaker 1>so like we're on the lip of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multi planet species.</v>

1701
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you do that,</v>

1702
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 1>which means you become a space faring </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

1703
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>then I think like certainly the asteroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff you can take care of.</v>

1704
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already done,</v>

1705
00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 1>we have identified like a huge fraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the earth crossing asteroids,</v>

1706
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 1>like we're not really sure what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them if we find one coming at us.</v>

1707
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>But we see some coming out us all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where they just recognize them a </v>

1708
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>few hours before near.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1709
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't happen a couple of weeks </v>

1710
01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>ago and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily it always passes.</v>

1711
01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>You can always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>So we couldn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1713
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>we're young enough now that if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered one heading right towards us,</v>

1714
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>we could just put down your legs between</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>

1715
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>between your legs and kiss your butt </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodbye.</v>

1716
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1717
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>but in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1718
01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:26.651
<v Speaker 1>200 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will have done a much better job of </v>

1719
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:26.651
<v Speaker 1>mapping out all the major rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

1721
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm really says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1722
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we have that kind of planetary</v>
<v Speaker 1>interplanetary,</v>

1723
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be mapping them out just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to run into them </v>

1724
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>or are you going to be mining them?</v>

1725
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is a promising in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the ability to prevent impacts?</v>

1726
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things.</v>

1727
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I think the best one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you catch it early enough,</v>

1728
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>there's the gravity tug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you just literally park a spaceship</v>

1729
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>next to it and slowly have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship,</v>

1730
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move yo because you only have to do is </v>

1731
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>altered the trajectory a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1732
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you just don't have the long bonnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1734
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm [inaudible] shit and spaces just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>vast that a little tap,</v>

1735
01:00:57.921 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>we'll make it miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the gravity Tokyo,</v>

1736
01:00:59.981 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to try and do the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

1737
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>What was the movie apocalypse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one with the from the nineties with </v>

1738
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1739
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>the space miners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1740
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon.</v>

1741
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1742
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a deep impact to deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact was the smart one.</v>

1743
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon was the rip each other's off,</v>

1744
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:20.051
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're both came out at the </v>

1745
01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:20.051
<v Speaker 1>same time and I think deep impact came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out first,</v>

1746
01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>but it was developed second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1747
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a bummer to be the one that </v>

1748
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1749
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>they both come out at the same time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your movie doesn't get any attention and</v>

1750
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the other one becomes like a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

1751
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1752
01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

1753
01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:36.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they drilled holes and stuff and </v>

1754
01:01:36.131 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>try and blow them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the problem there is you now </v>

1755
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>have a bunch of rocks and if some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those rocks are big enough.</v>

1756
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>So I think the gravity tug is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best idea.</v>

1757
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of um,</v>

1758
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a mining asteroids will probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1759
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>those little ones maybe the easiest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1760
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:49.601
<v Speaker 1>to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you worried about more than </v>

1761
01:01:49.601 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>anything in terms of climate change?</v>

1762
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you worried about the rising of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean levels.</v>

1763
01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried about the heating of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual planet,</v>

1764
01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the temperature being unsustainable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>human life?</v>

1765
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most?</v>

1766
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I'm worried about the most</v>

1767
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>liquid we're talking before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1768
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>technological societies are these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlaid networks,</v>

1769
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the transportation network,</v>

1770
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you've got the energy network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got social networks,</v>

1771
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are really complex.</v>

1772
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:18.491
<v Speaker 1>And so I do a little what's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>network theory and what you find with </v>

1773
01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:18.491
<v Speaker 1>network theory is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1774
01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you may have an individual network </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty robust,</v>

1775
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>meaning like I can cut some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

1776
01:02:22.681 --> 01:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>like you got your social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could take,</v>

1777
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 percent of the people out of your </v>

1778
01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>social network and the social like will </v>
<v Speaker 1>still function,</v>

1779
01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people will still talk to each</v>

1780
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>other or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you start layering them,</v>

1781
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>so at the social network is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the telecommunications </v>

1782
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>network which is connected to the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

1783
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah.</v>

1784
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Then you can repeat a small change </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripples through the whole thing blows it</v>

1785
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't function anymore.</v>

1786
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need like apocalypses to have </v>

1787
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of technological civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart.</v>

1788
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if the,</v>

1789
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:55.221
<v Speaker 1>if just the weather patterns change </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough that agriculture becomes really </v>

1790
01:02:55.221 --> 01:02:55.221
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1791
01:02:55.221 --> 01:03:00.170
<v Speaker 1>we're used to the rain's falling pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the same way they do yearly and </v>

1792
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.810
<v Speaker 1>everything that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1793
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>like we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at what the refugees,</v>

1794
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:09.231
<v Speaker 1>how much trouble you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a huge influx of refugees can </v>

1795
01:03:09.231 --> 01:03:13.221
<v Speaker 1>cause climate change is going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people moving all over the planet </v>

1796
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:13.221
<v Speaker 1>because now they can't grow food </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

1797
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1798
01:03:13.881 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need.</v>

1799
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I do worry like ocean rise is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be huge.</v>

1800
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:22.611
<v Speaker 1>Most people live in coastal cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the wealth in the world is in </v>

1801
01:03:22.611 --> 01:03:25.431
<v Speaker 1>coastal cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really need too much to </v>

1802
01:03:25.431 --> 01:03:29.091
<v Speaker 1>like really shift the weather patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing you're used to falls </v>

1803
01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:29.091
<v Speaker 1>apart</v>

1804
01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>now when you factor in human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our evolution from primitive hominids to</v>

1805
01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:40.831
<v Speaker 2>what we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you sort of extrapolate and keep </v>

1806
01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:41.740
<v Speaker 2>going and think about what we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the future.</v>

1807
01:03:41.741 --> 01:03:46.741
<v Speaker 2>And then think about what these </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures might be that live 100 million</v>

1808
01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>light years away or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck it is what I mean we've got,</v>

1809
01:03:52.301 --> 01:03:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I've got to think that whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding us back,</v>

1810
01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 2>our primitive instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these human reward systems that were </v>

1811
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.361
<v Speaker 2>engaged when we were running away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild animals and fighting off tribes </v>

1812
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:10.951
<v Speaker 2>have invaders that slowly but surely </v>
<v Speaker 2>those are going to either evaporate or </v>

1813
01:04:11.231 --> 01:04:16.231
<v Speaker 2>evolve and we're going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we can be more rational about </v>

1814
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:20.581
<v Speaker 2>complex issues if we do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the motivation for </v>

1815
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 2>expanding the human race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't sustaining the human race in a </v>

1816
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.221
<v Speaker 2>healthy way on this planet a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>option than traveling to Mars or </v>

1817
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 2>traveling to other solar systems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wouldn't we be better served trying</v>

1818
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>to achieve some sort of a balance here </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this planet?</v>

1819
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1820
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I think one serves the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

1821
01:04:45.491 --> 01:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the human migration patterns</v>

1822
01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.770
<v Speaker 1>from when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1823
01:04:48.771 --> 01:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started off as a,</v>

1824
01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:50.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people in Africa,</v>

1825
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a few thousand,</v>

1826
01:04:52.241 --> 01:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see this migration like,</v>

1827
01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of us,</v>

1828
01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>like a few hundred crossed the Red Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty low at the time.</v>

1829
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like they just worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way around the coasts,</v>

1830
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boats over to Australia went all the way</v>

1831
01:05:05.921 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>back around through like we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>explorers,</v>

1832
01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these,</v>

1833
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1834
01:05:09.671 --> 01:05:14.671
<v Speaker 1>I think something fundamental for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically to have these frontiers.</v>

1835
01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:20.791
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my question is will we evolve </v>

1836
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:20.791
<v Speaker 1>past that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1837
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1838
01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this bad thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1840
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the biosphere.</v>

1841
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something deep in life </v>

1842
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that wants more life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1843
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So if we call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1844
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Settle Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1845
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>then it's not going to be really us </v>
<v Speaker 1>settling Mars.</v>

1846
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the earth's biosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1847
01:05:35.441 --> 01:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean really are we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the agent of the biosphere.</v>

1848
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1849
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the biosphere started off as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1850
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>single celled creatures in like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny parts of the planet.</v>

1851
01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you have conquered the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually when they were,</v>

1852
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>because in the beginning there weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>

1853
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>there was a water world when we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1854
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1855
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.140
<v Speaker 1>there was enough continence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1856
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they took over the life,</v>

1857
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>took over the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just Kinda,</v>

1858
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>life may be kind of like a cosmic force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can get ugly on you,</v>

1859
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>if we do go to Mars and will essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>be ultimate panspermia.</v>

1860
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1861
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:06:06.241 --> 01:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1863
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:11.971
<v Speaker 1>Panspermia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we were always a weird word to </v>

1864
01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:13.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of pants for me because people feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird about sperms whenever I give an </v>

1865
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 1>academic talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1866
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a strange when you say sperm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of people that are like you </v>

1867
01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:21.330
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1868
01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a scientific term,</v>

1869
01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear a matter.</v>

1870
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying niggardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1871
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very difficult word to say.</v>

1872
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with the n word.</v>

1873
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1874
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1875
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1876
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think life wants more life.</v>

1877
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And this is the question you're raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1878
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:37.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we look like in a million years?</v>

1879
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.710
<v Speaker 1>What happens to a species that become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1880
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>now we're in the realm of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

1881
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:43.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1882
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what might we become like the gods </v>

1883
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 1>in some scenes.</v>

1884
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is my theory and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown this out so many times,</v>

1885
01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:57.791
<v Speaker 2>people are sick of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what we're looking at </v>

1886
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:00.131
<v Speaker 2>when we see these archetypal aliens with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big heads and the big eyes and the </v>

1887
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:04.361
<v Speaker 2>tiny bodies and no genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we think this is what we're </v>

1888
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:07.560
<v Speaker 2>eventually going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to move past that man.</v>

1889
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you in your panspermia and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise you typically typically talking </v>

1890
01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:22.121
<v Speaker 2>about gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the problem and this is why we </v>

1891
01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.950
<v Speaker 2>need diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1892
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I just think that if we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are archetypes kind of built </v>

1893
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.170
<v Speaker 2>into some sense that we're moving pat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1894
01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did we used to be?</v>

1895
01:07:31.461 --> 01:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to be monkeys,</v>

1896
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to be?</v>

1897
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to be that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing that can levitate things,</v>

1898
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:40.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's mind the thing to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>telepathically,</v>

1899
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 2>that thing that has this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to map out the cosmos and create</v>

1900
01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:51.941
<v Speaker 2>wormholes and the super advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced to a point where we can't even </v>

1901
01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:55.820
<v Speaker 2>comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you think about how,</v>

1902
01:07:55.850 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know w w we evolved from at one </v>

1903
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.050
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we split from mollusks like what?</v>

1904
01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.310
<v Speaker 2>600 something</v>

1905
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be on it.</v>

1906
01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.230
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be past the Cambrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion,</v>

1907
01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1908
01:08:09.771 --> 01:08:10.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>

1909
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>400.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet.</v>

1910
01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:13.250
<v Speaker 2>So awhile ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1911
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>how much does a squid understand about</v>

1912
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 3>cell phone networks and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sprint's unlimited data plan plans.</v>

1913
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:25.991
<v Speaker 3>Really any good picked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll we'll extrapolate that to what </v>

1914
01:08:25.991 --> 01:08:30.600
<v Speaker 3>this alien creature is going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of its understanding of time and </v>

1915
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.351
<v Speaker 3>space and matter versus ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are this crude thing that's weirded </v>

1916
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:40.451
<v Speaker 3>out by the word sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas it is telepathically </v>

1917
01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:44.051
<v Speaker 3>communicating with a universal language </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has this unbelievable ability to </v>

1918
01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>manipulate matter and they've achieved </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeostasis with their environment.</v>

1919
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 3>No longer have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one of the things about,</v>

1920
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the Fermi paradox,</v>

1921
01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:51.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1922
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Like why haven't we seen so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1923
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>as I already said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't looked enough to say that </v>

1924
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't seen evidence of life,</v>

1925
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like opening your door and goes,</v>

1926
01:08:59.331 --> 01:09:03.680
<v Speaker 3>well where are all the buffalo to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming.</v>

1927
01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 3>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
01:09:07.071 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 3>there is a kind of a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we just do a paper on this now,</v>

1929
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:11.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the permit paradox.</v>

1930
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go too far on this.</v>

1931
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Can we can go back circle back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1932
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had ducks is fascinating.</v>

1933
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:18.440
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1934
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:19.150
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1935
01:09:19.151 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we had two people.</v>

1936
01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Fermi paradox is the idea that </v>

1937
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1938
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there is,</v>

1939
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:29.650
<v Speaker 3>if the paradox part is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're telling me that intelligence </v>

1940
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 3>is commented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolves everywhere,</v>

1941
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.240
<v Speaker 3>then why don't I see it already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1942
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.620
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1943
01:09:33.621 --> 01:09:36.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're asking about like why don't we</v>
<v Speaker 3>see signals from that,</v>

1944
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I've already answered that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1945
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Because we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't looked yet so yet,</v>

1946
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 3>but hit part of his question and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was done by a guy in heart.</v>

1947
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me it was just,</v>

1948
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 3>this happened over a conversation in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lunch,</v>

1949
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:46.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1950.</v>

1950
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 3>So he just posed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said where are they all?</v>

1951
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:54.670
<v Speaker 3>But in 1975 guy named Hart wrote a paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he really mapped out the here's </v>

1952
01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:58.361
<v Speaker 3>the main problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're traveling with a 10th of </v>

1953
01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.000
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you managed to build like world ships</v>

1954
01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:01.010
<v Speaker 3>that can travel across the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1955
01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.940
<v Speaker 3>and you're traveling at point one </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the speed of light in,</v>

1956
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:10.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do that and you hop from one </v>

1957
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:10.210
<v Speaker 3>store to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>build another ship,</v>

1958
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 3>hop to the next one in about 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1959
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 3>You have covered the whole galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1960
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:13.580
<v Speaker 3>So 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1961
01:10:13.581 --> 01:10:18.581
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a tiny part of the galaxies </v>

1962
01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:18.581
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxies,</v>

1963
01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 3>10 billion years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that case,</v>

1964
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:24.191
<v Speaker 3>like why every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if just one species has to do that and </v>

1965
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 3>they can cover the galaxy.</v>

1966
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 3>So why aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we see the colony ships here?</v>

1967
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1968
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:33.050
<v Speaker 3>that's a much harder version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fermi paradox to get around.</v>

1969
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Is it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we did.</v>

1970
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're already sending robots to Mars,</v>

1971
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to Mars yet,</v>

1972
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:44.171
<v Speaker 3>but we're sending robots there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if we decide that there's no real </v>

1973
01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:47.531
<v Speaker 3>benefit in sending biological entities </v>
<v Speaker 3>into space and that the dangers of </v>

1974
01:10:47.531 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 3>radiation and asteroidal impacts on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just too great.</v>

1975
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 3>It's far better to send something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1976
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>look at what we're capable of doing now </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of projection of video.</v>

1977
01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:02.950
<v Speaker 3>We can take a cell phone video and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could send it to your friend in New </v>

1978
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Zealand and they can get it almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously to go to do a skype call</v>

1979
01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:11.930
<v Speaker 3>where we can get some sort of three d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality imaging of these planets</v>

1980
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:12.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1981
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 3>do you want to see what it's like on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pandora here?</v>

1982
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:20.481
<v Speaker 3>Put these goggles on and you will go </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you want that robot to go and </v>

1983
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:21.820
<v Speaker 3>you'll be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1984
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.840
<v Speaker 3>And maybe it'll get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually smell it and touch it </v>

1985
01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.171
<v Speaker 3>and feel it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not be compromised by its </v>

1986
01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:30.171
<v Speaker 3>environment in terms of your bio.</v>

1987
01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that's actually a huge point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things we're </v>

1988
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>looking at in this paper is the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1989
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good planets may be hard to find.</v>

1990
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this great novel by Kim Stanley </v>

1991
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Robinson who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for me,</v>

1992
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the great science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

1993
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's called Aurora and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the usual worldship thing go.</v>

1994
01:11:42.761 --> 01:11:47.761
<v Speaker 1>So they build the colony ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes three generations to cross </v>

1995
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>space and they get to the planet and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet socks,</v>

1996
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:51.090
<v Speaker 1>it looked like it was going to be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1997
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's like prions tiny or super </v>
<v Speaker 1>small biological shit that just makes </v>

1998
01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't live there and then going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1999
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2000
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.300
<v Speaker 1>it may be exactly like you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2001
01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think like,</v>

2002
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just land on a planet,</v>

2003
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:07.071
<v Speaker 1>your terraform it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just turned it into a habitable and </v>

2004
01:12:07.071 --> 01:12:07.071
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may not work and maybe it does,</v>

2005
01:12:07.071 --> 01:12:07.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's a science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2006
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2007
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>

2008
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of possible solutions is,</v>

2009
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 1>which is just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2010
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which is space is really hard and</v>

2011
01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:18.810
<v Speaker 1>really interstellar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not interplanetary,</v>

2012
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but interstellar travel is really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really expensive.</v>

2013
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:26.931
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading the paper on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a guy estimated that in order to </v>

2014
01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:26.931
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2015
01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:30.050
<v Speaker 1>say you wanted to have a thousand people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a worldship to get to another star </v>

2016
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:31.560
<v Speaker 1>that would take the economy that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>need like a,</v>

2017
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I think was like 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth economies</v>

2018
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.240
<v Speaker 3>to build that Jeff Paizos are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening time?</v>

2019
01:12:38.241 --> 01:12:39.470
<v Speaker 3>We're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have,</v>

2020
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:42.830
<v Speaker 3>but it was just like it was so much,</v>

2021
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2022
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Unless you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2023
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you know what the conclusion he came to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were a multi planet species,</v>

2024
01:12:47.771 --> 01:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2025
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>if you had conquered the entire um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2026
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.520
<v Speaker 1>or settled the entire solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd have an economy that big.</v>

2027
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one possible solution is good planets </v>

2028
01:12:59.700 --> 01:12:59.700
<v Speaker 1>are hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2029
01:12:59.700 --> 01:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2030
01:12:59.921 --> 01:13:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really costs a lot.</v>

2031
01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really worth the effort.</v>

2032
01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send out some probes once in a </v>

2033
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:10.360
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2034
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:10.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

2035
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also finding an environment that's </v>

2036
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.160
<v Speaker 3>not just habitable but stable in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment is habitable.</v>

2037
01:13:15.161 --> 01:13:17.560
<v Speaker 3>But look what's going on in Hawaii right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2038
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:21.760
<v Speaker 3>There is a 400 year old lake that </v>
<v Speaker 3>evaporated in a matter of hours,</v>

2039
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest lake on the big island.</v>

2040
01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.740
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is such a tragedy,</v>

2041
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2042
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.890
<v Speaker 3>It's magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2043
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:33.100
<v Speaker 3>And you watch that lava roll into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lake and say that's a wrap.</v>

2044
01:13:33.101 --> 01:13:38.101
<v Speaker 3>Kids no more lakey flux.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really shows you the power of a </v>

2045
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:40.870
<v Speaker 3>planet to that sources at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes continents?</v>

2046
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean it made the island in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2047
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't be upset at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billowing off.</v>

2048
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It is what made the island right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's continuing to make the island here,</v>

2049
01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:13:49.151 --> 01:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2051
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:52.150
<v Speaker 3>That's right about your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you've got more real estate.</v>

2052
01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:57.150
<v Speaker 3>So shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's making the island bigger and it's </v>

2053
01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:59.311
<v Speaker 3>always done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been doing that for millions of </v>

2054
01:13:59.311 --> 01:13:59.311
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating place.</v>

2055
01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 3>If you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been and I've seen the.</v>

2056
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I want you to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do the helicopter thing?</v>

2057
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2058
01:14:04.601 --> 01:14:09.601
<v Speaker 3>you got to do the helicopter thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy because you fly over the </v>

2059
01:14:09.601 --> 01:14:09.910
<v Speaker 3>volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't now because it's too crazy,</v>

2060
01:14:09.911 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 3>but I did a few back and you could watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2061
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 3>The lava go into the ocean and you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>these lava events.</v>

2062
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Poor is red hot fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2063
01:14:21.521 --> 01:14:26.521
<v Speaker 3>it's glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going into the ocean that I saw </v>

2064
01:14:26.521 --> 01:14:26.521
<v Speaker 3>that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the park to see it,</v>

2065
01:14:26.521 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you went to,</v>

2066
01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:32.941
<v Speaker 3>when you go to that volcano park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just like vince were steams </v>

2067
01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:32.941
<v Speaker 3>coming out like New York City with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2068
01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:33.700
<v Speaker 3>the manholes.</v>

2069
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:38.700
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just from this heat coming in </v>

2070
01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>from the bottom of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you scared about yellowstone?</v>

2071
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the uh,</v>

2072
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.360
<v Speaker 3>what was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A 2012 map.</v>

2073
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Like where did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's such a.</v>

2074
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 3>that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what made the adirondacks right.</v>

2075
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:54.030
<v Speaker 3>What was the 2012 movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that with ge Qa after </v>

2076
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.030
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Day.</v>

2077
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Before tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2078
01:14:54.211 --> 01:14:54.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2079
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.530
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

2080
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.730
<v Speaker 3>it was a climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was John cusack.</v>

2081
01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.070
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a pretty good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.420
<v Speaker 3>That's another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like destroy the plant.</v>

2083
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Those guys who made that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

2084
01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:03.340
<v Speaker 3>stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not a pretty good movie.</v>

2085
01:15:03.341 --> 01:15:04.840
<v Speaker 3>That movie sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thought it was good.</v>

2086
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm moving so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid mistake.</v>

2087
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Disaster by inches with the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never got a flat.</v>

2088
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 3>They always got away from the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world caving in.</v>

2089
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Totally believable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2090
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2091
01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought.</v>

2092
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone is a caldera.</v>

2093
01:15:22.991 --> 01:15:27.991
<v Speaker 3>It's a super volcano and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing thousands of earthquakes a </v>

2094
01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:30.640
<v Speaker 3>year and that eventually every six to </v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000</v>

2095
01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a continent killer.</v>

2096
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:33.940
<v Speaker 3>The last time it blew was 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

2097
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 3>So why aren't you scared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2098
01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think about it.</v>

2099
01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking thinking about it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2100
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll smoke a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about once a month I think </v>

2101
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.070
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2102
01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2103
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add that to my list of things.</v>

2104
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:51.031
<v Speaker 3>I'm freaking out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends in Australia and that's </v>

2105
01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:51.031
<v Speaker 3>where I'm going because there's light </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

2106
01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Just start driving on the left hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2107
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing you can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worried more about Seattle.</v>

2108
01:15:55.631 --> 01:16:00.631
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Seattle for a while and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said the super earthquake that they're </v>

2109
01:16:00.631 --> 01:16:03.631
<v Speaker 3>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to turn the whole thing into </v>

2110
01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:03.631
<v Speaker 3>Jello.</v>

2111
01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get an earthquake so bad that the </v>

2112
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 3>ground just literally becomes porous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really that scary?</v>

2113
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:05.800
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2114
01:16:05.801 --> 01:16:06.750
<v Speaker 3>they're predicting because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2115
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Seattle's got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2116
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:09.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that much about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm way out of my.</v>

2117
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the danger zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2118
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 3>the plates are super deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2119
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:16.680
<v Speaker 3>so you don't get as many tremors but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2120
01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.740
<v Speaker 3>when it releases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be a super powerful </v>

2121
01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:22.150
<v Speaker 3>earthquake and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

2122
01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.400
<v Speaker 3>it'll be so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2123
01:16:23.401 --> 01:16:25.330
<v Speaker 3>That they said that like there's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be even,</v>

2124
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:30.450
<v Speaker 3>even with the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proofing is not gonna be be left </v>

2125
01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:30.450
<v Speaker 3>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

2126
01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:30.650
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

2127
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must be,</v>

2128
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're here,</v>

2129
01:16:33.641 --> 01:16:34.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel tremors.</v>

2130
01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 3>They might say they happen all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2131
01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:40.801
<v Speaker 3>I've only been a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not all the time I've felt them </v>

2132
01:16:40.801 --> 01:16:40.801
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2133
01:16:40.801 --> 01:16:43.890
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest ones I ever felt was when I </v>

2134
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:43.890
<v Speaker 3>first moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first moved here in [inaudible] 94 and</v>

2135
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:45.340
<v Speaker 3>it was right after the northridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake and uh,</v>

2136
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 3>I was in my house and I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2137
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was like a five point five </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the whole thing just,</v>

2138
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:58.080
<v Speaker 3>it was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gave me the impression that the </v>

2139
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.321
<v Speaker 3>house that I was living in or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment that I was in was made out of </v>

2140
01:17:01.321 --> 01:17:04.831
<v Speaker 3>the same stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a box that a refrigerator would </v>

2141
01:17:04.831 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 3>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can move it around inside.</v>

2142
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.830
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was just moving like </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily and right.</v>

2143
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2144
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my.</v>

2145
01:17:11.601 --> 01:17:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I've only had a few times that I've felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm like,</v>

2146
01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2147
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.270
<v Speaker 1>at first I thought it was a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the truck was rolling by,</v>

2148
01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

2149
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody says,</v>

2150
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was an earthquake.</v>

2151
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And the one that I experienced was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2152
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a baby one ones that they're </v>

2153
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:27.520
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2154
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.040
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the world.</v>

2155
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:33.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always something that's like a </v>

2156
01:17:33.041 --> 01:17:33.041
<v Speaker 1>five or six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:17:33.041 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 1>So this goes back to your point about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2158
01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:33.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2159
01:17:33.981 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2160
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:39.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll be like way more plate </v>
<v Speaker 1>tectonically active volatile than ours.</v>

2161
01:17:39.751 --> 01:17:40.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2162
01:17:40.321 --> 01:17:45.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of times and I think good </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets are going to be really hard to </v>

2163
01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:45.321
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2164
01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be,</v>

2165
01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 1>that may be the solution.</v>

2166
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>The other solution is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2167
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you guys found out about me,</v>

2168
01:17:50.701 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 1>so I did that article about the previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

2169
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is it,</v>

2170
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:56.070
<v Speaker 1>how do you know whether or not there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a previous civilization?</v>

2171
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2172
01:17:57.831 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one solution could be that,</v>

2173
01:17:59.901 --> 01:18:01.310
<v Speaker 1>look they were here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2174
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 1>that somebody did arrive and spend some </v>
<v Speaker 1>time on earth,</v>

2175
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but if it was like half a billion years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and they only lasted,</v>

2176
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:11.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every civilization has a finite </v>

2177
01:18:11.711 --> 01:18:11.711
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only lasted for,</v>

2178
01:18:11.711 --> 01:18:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a few hundred thousand years.</v>

2179
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.570
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no record left to,</v>

2180
01:18:13.571 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be nothing.</v>

2181
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's ever visited here?</v>

2182
01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And because that is the big question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2183
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that gets the UFO dorks more </v>

2184
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:26.000
<v Speaker 1>jazzed up than anything is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that we'd been visited.</v>

2185
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the.</v>

2186
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not UFOS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2187
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:31.110
<v Speaker 1>there's two arguments against you if </v>
<v Speaker 1>owes a.</v>

2188
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.910
<v Speaker 1>One is as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2189
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.160
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason Wright says,</v>

2190
01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:35.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look as astronomers,</v>

2191
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were finding all those aspects.</v>

2192
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 1>We're finding a little chunks of rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

2193
01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody looks at the sky harder than we </v>

2194
01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2195
01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

2196
01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.800
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to go to the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

2197
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 1>we would've found something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My other argument is like,</v>

2198
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>what's with the headlights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2199
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:50.630
<v Speaker 1>People always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2200
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I saw lights in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they moved around and then they</v>

2201
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:53.120
<v Speaker 1>disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2202
01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really want to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2203
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:56.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they have headlights on?</v>

2204
01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Like why just turn off the fricking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>

2205
01:18:58.131 --> 01:19:03.131
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they have lights in the first </v>

2206
01:19:03.131 --> 01:19:03.131
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

2207
01:19:03.131 --> 01:19:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You came from another civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get around without your high </v>

2208
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:08.651
<v Speaker 1>beams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the ideas like what the fuck </v>

2209
01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:08.651
<v Speaker 1>are you seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What those lights,</v>

2210
01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:08.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not seeing shit.</v>

2211
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.530
<v Speaker 1>That was the last time you saw me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planes have lights so other planes don't</v>

2212
01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:17.531
<v Speaker 1>run into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the light so they could </v>

2213
01:19:17.531 --> 01:19:17.531
<v Speaker 1>see where they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:19:17.531 --> 01:19:17.531
<v Speaker 1>So what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do they have.</v>

2215
01:19:17.531 --> 01:19:17.531
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2216
01:19:17.531 --> 01:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>The planes have lights so other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can seem.</v>

2217
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So they're here but they're mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be found in turn off </v>

2218
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:23.890
<v Speaker 1>the fricking light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>

2219
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have any lines,</v>

2220
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have lights.</v>

2221
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are always seeing,</v>

2222
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:32.250
<v Speaker 1>like eliminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked this guy and then they moved </v>

2223
01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:33.751
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so also the problem with human </v>

2224
01:19:33.751 --> 01:19:36.611
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memory's horrible memory of events that </v>

2225
01:19:36.611 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 1>are stunning or shocking or unnerving or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you saw something,</v>

2226
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:39.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2227
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They've done all that research even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trials,</v>

2228
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:43.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people see things,</v>

2229
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kinda like.</v>

2230
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 1>But do you think it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be life on other planets and</v>

2231
01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it's possible there could be intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>life on other planets and we send probes</v>

2232
01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:54.450
<v Speaker 1>to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't.</v>

2233
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if they do send </v>
<v Speaker 1>something here,</v>

2234
01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:59.810
<v Speaker 1>they're going to send something without </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological life inside of it.</v>

2235
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:20:00.231 --> 01:20:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2237
01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really interesting question is </v>

2238
01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>will we evolve into in,</v>

2239
01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million years,</v>

2240
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:06.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2241
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>it may be possible that biology is</v>

2242
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 3>a short period of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You build machines and the machines </v>

2243
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.610
<v Speaker 3>become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2244
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 3>you download yourself into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2245
01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:17.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a real possibility that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 3>silicon makes a lot more sense than </v>
<v Speaker 3>wetware.</v>

2247
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is we think of artificial </v>

2248
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:25.760
<v Speaker 3>intelligence as artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2249
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.030
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2250
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2251
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2252
01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right there.</v>

2253
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's artificial milk,</v>

2254
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

2255
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an actual liquid.</v>

2256
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.530
<v Speaker 3>There's not an artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just silicon created life.</v>

2257
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the biosphere,</v>

2258
01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:47.061
<v Speaker 3>this may be the what the biosphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution to spreading itself to getting </v>

2259
01:20:47.061 --> 01:20:47.600
<v Speaker 3>it maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like silicon,</v>

2260
01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:52.670
<v Speaker 3>that that's kind of a normal face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am super skeptical about the whole </v>

2261
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:56.620
<v Speaker 3>trans human thing that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>download ourselves and do intelligent.</v>

2262
01:20:56.630 --> 01:21:01.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever gone to one of those </v>

2263
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:01.630
<v Speaker 3>conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows dorks.</v>

2264
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:02.600
<v Speaker 3>There's some pretty serious dork in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2265
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 3>there's geniuses in those dorks too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

2266
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:10.521
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're fully wholly committed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this prospect of downloading </v>

2267
01:21:10.521 --> 01:21:11.080
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've talked Kurtzweil before.</v>

2268
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2269
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:16.761
<v Speaker 3>but I've read his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a chance to interview him a few </v>

2270
01:21:16.761 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 3>years back for smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just like beyond smart,</v>

2271
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.790
<v Speaker 3>but God damn is he committed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get to it,</v>

2272
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:25.050
<v Speaker 3>you realize that what he actually wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is recreate his father.</v>

2273
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's his father died when he was young </v>

2274
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.430
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to be able to through </v>
<v Speaker 3>memories and photographs and what he </v>

2275
01:21:34.501 --> 01:21:39.501
<v Speaker 3>knows about his father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally recreate his father and to be </v>

2276
01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:41.610
<v Speaker 3>able to have a conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about this.</v>

2277
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what he's doing is he's going way,</v>

2278
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:50.721
<v Speaker 3>way into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the possibilities of he's not </v>

2279
01:21:50.721 --> 01:21:50.721
<v Speaker 3>seeing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2280
01:21:50.721 --> 01:21:52.410
<v Speaker 3>five years from now we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to send,</v>

2281
01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigabyte pictures to them,</v>

2282
01:21:54.591 --> 01:21:59.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying let's think of if you keep </v>

2283
01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:03.141
<v Speaker 3>going exponentially and the electronics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and technology and innovation keeps </v>

2284
01:22:03.141 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 3>continually accelerating.</v>

2285
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 3>We could potentially get to the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's the impossible.</v>

2286
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be able to recreate human beings </v>

2287
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.581
<v Speaker 3>based on your knowledge of them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll be able to come up with some </v>

2288
01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:20.091
<v Speaker 3>sort of a program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will he'll be able to have a </v>

2289
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:20.091
<v Speaker 3>conversation with his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:20.091
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that misunder.</v>

2291
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:20.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

2292
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:20.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true,</v>

2293
01:22:20.661 --> 01:22:25.661
<v Speaker 3>but like the possibility of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>singularity and technological </v>

2294
01:22:25.661 --> 01:22:25.661
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2295
01:22:25.661 --> 01:22:27.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the sad thing.</v>

2296
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we seriously,</v>

2297
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 3>I've done some work on this as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest of mine about mind.</v>

2298
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 3>What is mind and what's the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>between mind and matter?</v>

2299
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:39.860
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have like a serious </v>

2300
01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.141
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand consciousness very </v>

2301
01:22:42.141 --> 01:22:42.141
<v Speaker 3>well at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that like,</v>

2302
01:22:42.141 --> 01:22:46.611
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just got to be trivial to download </v>

2303
01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:46.611
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2304
01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:46.611
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness into a computer.</v>

2305
01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2306
01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:51.120
<v Speaker 3>there's like a shit load of assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there about like what mind is and the</v>

2307
01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 3>relationship between your neurons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2308
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I think those guys,</v>

2309
01:22:56.641 --> 01:22:58.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit of a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2310
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.790
<v Speaker 3>It is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2311
01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.370
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well 20,</v>

2312
01:23:02.371 --> 01:23:05.560
<v Speaker 3>45 is the new benchmark for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

2313
01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the new number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep going back.</v>

2314
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be like every other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every other rapture.</v>

2315
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 3>We thought it was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45.</v>

2316
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 3>We really been 20 slash 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to this 20,</v>

2317
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 3>45 conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and my friend Ran Duncan and we got </v>

2318
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:21.691
<v Speaker 3>to talk to some of these guys and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating and one of them had </v>

2319
01:23:21.691 --> 01:23:25.930
<v Speaker 3>created some robot that was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be him but it didn't work well.</v>

2320
01:23:25.931 --> 01:23:28.990
<v Speaker 3>So they never revealed that at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference that had too many bugs in it.</v>

2321
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:35.130
<v Speaker 3>It's intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I want them to keep going </v>

2322
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:35.130
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2323
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:38.731
<v Speaker 3>when are we going to get to x Mokena?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When are we going to get to talk about </v>

2324
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 3>good movies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or did you like that?</v>

2325
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite movies ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So smart.</v>

2326
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like simple.</v>

2327
01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:43.960
<v Speaker 3>He's not beating you over the head with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and know,</v>

2328
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:46.050
<v Speaker 3>cut the shit most moving moments in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

2329
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.740
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2330
01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 3>The entire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of my all time top 20</v>

2331
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he stabs him just emotionless.</v>

2332
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Just family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting the blade in.</v>

2333
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:57.060
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing alert.</v>

2334
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Did you like annihilation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I didn't like it as much but I </v>

2335
01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:08.611
<v Speaker 3>liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very weird and the ending seemed </v>

2336
01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:10.230
<v Speaker 3>like some producers put their just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the soup just like Pittsburgh,</v>

2337
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 3>what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who made this part?</v>

2338
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2340
01:24:14.571 --> 01:24:16.780
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think like,</v>

2341
01:24:16.781 --> 01:24:21.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the danger with anything when it comes </v>

2342
01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:21.781
<v Speaker 3>to ai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you.</v>

2343
01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting thing about ai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're,</v>

2344
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:25.320
<v Speaker 3>we are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making amazing strides with ai now.</v>

2345
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Now artificial intelligence is different</v>
<v Speaker 3>from artificial consciousness.</v>

2346
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:28.760
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2347
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.550
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ai that,</v>

2348
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:36.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're getting out of it is nothing </v>

2349
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:36.560
<v Speaker 3>like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2350
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:36.560
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2351
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:36.580
<v Speaker 3>back in the day where people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2352
01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 3>we're going to model the human brain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how we'll do it.</v>

2353
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:44.371
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like programs that are what and what </v>

2354
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:44.371
<v Speaker 3>they've learned is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2355
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't really work that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now this whole big data thing like,</v>

2356
01:24:45.191 --> 01:24:50.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>network theory and big data and deep </v>

2357
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:50.191
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2358
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:50.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using statistical,</v>

2359
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power of,</v>

2360
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 3>of having huge amounts of computing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistical reasoning so that like,</v>

2361
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the computer,</v>

2362
01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:56.840
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2363
01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.860
<v Speaker 3>it'll find the picture of the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have no idea why it found that </v>

2364
01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:02.470
<v Speaker 3>it didn't reason like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2365
01:25:02.471 --> 01:25:03.990
<v Speaker 3>that was sort of looks like cat and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like cats,</v>

2366
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>

2367
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:09.781
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of lines go with that kind </v>

2368
01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:09.781
<v Speaker 3>of thing and it has no idea what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2369
01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but it'll act intelligently.</v>

2370
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2371
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's kind of freaky deaky in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways too.</v>

2372
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:19.891
<v Speaker 3>I think people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's smart to think about the </v>

2373
01:25:19.891 --> 01:25:23.311
<v Speaker 3>dangers of Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily want to take some </v>

2374
01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:23.440
<v Speaker 3>pictures to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily the dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the dangers to this thing that we </v>

2376
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 3>are this weird monkey thing that wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep being a monkey thing.</v>

2377
01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean in the sense of like,</v>

2378
01:25:32.771 --> 01:25:34.210
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going to replace us?</v>

2379
01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's inevitable.</v>

2381
01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that if you go back and </v>

2382
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:44.071
<v Speaker 3>interview the single celled organism </v>
<v Speaker 3>before branched off into multicell </v>

2383
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:49.330
<v Speaker 3>multicell bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to stay a single cell at </v>

2384
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:53.281
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the rock and roll music </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're to mail cars.</v>

2385
01:25:53.501 --> 01:25:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a car man.</v>

2386
01:25:55.511 --> 01:25:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I like stand down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some real thought to that,</v>

2387
01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:02.230
<v Speaker 3>that we are the wetware that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2388
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:02.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2389
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2390
01:26:03.311 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fully conceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not going do it.</v>

2391
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It'll never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a guy knows,</v>

2392
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 3>a philosopher says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2393
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:12.620
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain way in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything we do with ai right now,</v>

2394
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2395
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Watson is playing chess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're using Watson to play </v>

2396
01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>chess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's our tool,</v>

2397
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:22.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the fear is the toolkits add</v>

2398
01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.360
<v Speaker 3>a hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that it develops a thing where like </v>

2399
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:27.360
<v Speaker 3>I hated humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2400
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:27.360
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate you,</v>

2401
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.230
<v Speaker 3>but more that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2402
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>these things which are not actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

2403
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 3>they act intelligent but they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking can have a huge.</v>

2404
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Like it'll have a really negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact,</v>

2405
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

2406
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2407
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 3>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that example of like,</v>

2408
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:40.310
<v Speaker 3>if you design something that is an ai </v>
<v Speaker 3>system to make paperclips,</v>

2409
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:45.460
<v Speaker 3>it ends up consuming the entire planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>making paperclips because that's what </v>

2410
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:45.460
<v Speaker 3>you told it to do.</v>

2411
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never told it to make a sustainable </v>

2412
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2413
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

2414
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm more worried about that than I am of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Sky Net,</v>

2415
01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming over and like,</v>

2416
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:56.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deciding that it's going to take a drop </v>

2417
01:26:56.981 --> 01:26:56.981
<v Speaker 3>all the bombs on it because it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of it.</v>

2418
01:26:56.981 --> 01:27:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Well there's no biological imperative </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a silicon based artificial </v>

2419
01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to procreate to keep going </v>
<v Speaker 3>and move forward.</v>

2420
01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:08.351
<v Speaker 3>Like why do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it because we came from biology.</v>

2421
01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Biology needs to stay alive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants bigger,</v>

2422
01:27:12.471 --> 01:27:13.790
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger.</v>

2423
01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:18.791
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep moving and it's because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real possibility that you </v>

2424
01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:19.700
<v Speaker 3>might get consumed by some other life </v>
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>

2425
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 3>So you have to protect yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to look out for other people who </v>

2426
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.220
<v Speaker 3>might want to breed with the viable </v>
<v Speaker 3>female that you've copulated with.</v>

2427
01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit going on built in </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionarily to have.</v>

2428
01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 3>But we assume that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>these artificial creations will have as </v>

2429
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why,</v>

2430
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:39.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean yeah,</v>

2431
01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:42.500
<v Speaker 3>like if we program it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is like,</v>

2432
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but will it wake up like so that if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>does wake up,</v>

2433
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:48.410
<v Speaker 3>will it have the inclination towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific research?</v>

2434
01:27:48.411 --> 01:27:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Would it even want to send something </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the cosmos of us?</v>

2435
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2436
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2437
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we just don't know if it </v>

2438
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.490
<v Speaker 3>actually because listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2439
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:01.510
<v Speaker 3>we understand so little about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is and what its </v>

2440
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.510
<v Speaker 3>imperatives are like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Once you wake up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2442
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 3>you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2443
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to see like why?</v>

2444
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:09.401
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what really did you like </v>

2445
01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:09.401
<v Speaker 3>Battlestar Galactica?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved Battlestar.</v>

2446
01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>God damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the new version?</v>

2447
01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I love the old version because that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was 14 years old and spaceships,</v>

2448
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.350
<v Speaker 3>but the new version was amazing.</v>

2449
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there is a show that I wish they </v>

2450
01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:24.730
<v Speaker 3>would bring back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Battlestar Galactica the ending.</v>

2451
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:26.900
<v Speaker 3>But the ending though it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2452
01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:30.710
<v Speaker 3>they had to end it is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fucking series was brilliant.</v>

2453
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.840
<v Speaker 3>It was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what was amazing about that?</v>

2454
01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:37.841
<v Speaker 3>The way they wrapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the political shit that was </v>

2455
01:28:37.841 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 3>happening after nine slash 11 to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>man from the torture scenes.</v>

2456
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so.</v>

2457
01:28:40.601 --> 01:28:43.740
<v Speaker 3>And then they even had the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with starbuck about know what was she,</v>

2458
01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of like it was five </v>

2459
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2460
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 3>And there were a couple of seasons where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2461
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda got a little ran off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's her name?</v>

2462
01:28:51.831 --> 01:28:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Katie sackhoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that her name?</v>

2463
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starbuck?</v>

2464
01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that her name?</v>

2465
01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's so good.</v>

2466
01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:02.710
<v Speaker 3>She was really good in that role stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>since she's got a movie out right now on</v>

2467
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>

2468
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:04.260
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2469
01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2470
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:05.610
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2471
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 3>but she had rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sort of disappeared.</v>

2472
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 3>It was so good in that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2473
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.630
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like the launching pad for her.</v>

2474
01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you almost revolutionary about that </v>

2475
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:17.650
<v Speaker 3>show to the way they did the special </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects were like,</v>

2476
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camera moved around.</v>

2477
01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2478
01:29:18.941 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>

2479
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't do,</v>

2480
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it did those long pants,</v>

2481
01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but it was kind of opened up a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of sort of looking at,</v>

2482
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2483
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:28.530
<v Speaker 3>just sort of what it looks like to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>space and stuff.</v>

2484
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it really scared the shit out of </v>

2485
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:34.941
<v Speaker 3>people in terms of artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that we create the decides </v>

2486
01:29:34.941 --> 01:29:35.340
<v Speaker 3>it's done with us and it's taking over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2487
01:29:35.341 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's amazing about that,</v>

2488
01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 3>and this is I've written about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that like,</v>

2489
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we keep telling that story over and over</v>

2490
01:29:39.811 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2491
01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:41.520
<v Speaker 3>How many movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2492
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 3>can you think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that.</v>

2493
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.420
<v Speaker 3>And I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm really interested in myth,</v>

2494
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:45.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2495
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole mythology,</v>

2496
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:48.230
<v Speaker 3>the way like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 3>we can never get away from the myths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2498
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.450
<v Speaker 3>coming of age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hero's journey,</v>

2499
01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Campbell,</v>

2500
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Campbell Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2501
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.060
<v Speaker 3>but like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening with us now,</v>

2502
01:29:57.061 --> 01:29:58.020
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in,</v>

2503
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.080
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in the storehouse of </v>
<v Speaker 3>myth to take care of like building </v>

2504
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 3>machines that take over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2505
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.600
<v Speaker 3>So the reason we keep telling that story</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again is we're preparing </v>

2506
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:08.600
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2507
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 3>We're building the myths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2508
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:12.000
<v Speaker 3>that sort of will help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going to happen,</v>

2509
01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:14.730
<v Speaker 3>but we have to keep telling that story </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can feel it coming,</v>

2510
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is.</v>

2511
01:30:16.251 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 3>So we need to keep telling a story to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of explore what the options are.</v>

2512
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:25.730
<v Speaker 3>And I liked that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked about the ending and I didn't </v>

2513
01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:25.730
<v Speaker 3>think the ending was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that like,</v>

2514
01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:25.920
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this balance,</v>

2515
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:30.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to keep going through these </v>

2516
01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:30.921
<v Speaker 3>cycles of trying to achieve this balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>

2517
01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:34.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silicon forms and non silica and then </v>

2518
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:34.341
<v Speaker 3>biological forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2519
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 3>well we have not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were worried that we're going to be </v>

2520
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:41.091
<v Speaker 3>taken over by something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not overly concerned with </v>

2521
01:30:41.091 --> 01:30:44.541
<v Speaker 3>evolving our own biology changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's the solution in terms </v>

2522
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 3>of our physical limitations is some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a symbiotic connection between us and</v>

2523
01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:54.741
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That instead of artificial technology </v>

2524
01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:57.770
<v Speaker 3>and artificial life taking over usurping</v>
<v Speaker 3>us instead of that maybe we become a </v>

2525
01:30:57.781 --> 01:31:00.030
<v Speaker 3>part of it and it becomes a part of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we.</v>

2526
01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have glasses on,</v>

2527
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.400
<v Speaker 3>you can see better with those glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially a Cyborg.</v>

2528
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2529
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2530
01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:07.080
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2531
01:31:07.081 --> 01:31:07.920
<v Speaker 3>And these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2532
01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:09.040
<v Speaker 3>these cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

2533
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:11.200
<v Speaker 3>my memories in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to no cell phones.</v>

2534
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 3>My house two days ago without my phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I turned around in a panic on my own</v>

2535
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:17.600
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's my fucking.</v>

2536
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2537
01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.090
<v Speaker 3>You remember when you used to have phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers in your head?</v>

2538
01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2539
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:25.950
<v Speaker 3>My wife's number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2540
01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I got three digits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam go further than this crazy.</v>

2541
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:33.030
<v Speaker 3>But we remember a lot of other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2542
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have so much.</v>

2543
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really overwhelmed.</v>

2544
01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:41.790
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm in that weird zone where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't have,</v>

2545
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough data space.</v>

2546
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough storage for all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2547
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to kind of pick and choose,</v>

2548
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like wikipedia.</v>

2549
01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:55.611
<v Speaker 3>We're all human knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Entire sum of human knowledge is right </v>

2550
01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:55.611
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2551
01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:56.970
<v Speaker 3>mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2552
01:31:56.971 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changes.</v>

2553
01:31:58.711 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were talking about what</v>

2554
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 1>an amazing change that you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much,</v>

2555
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2556
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love comics,</v>

2557
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2558
01:32:06.151 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I was a comic marvel guy way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2559
01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2560
01:32:10.361 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you paid for your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to,</v>

2561
01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all you got your ass kicked.</v>

2562
01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2563
01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to the store every week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get the comics and you know,</v>

2564
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just look up captain America and you</v>

2565
01:32:20.141 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>can know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was about his,</v>

2566
01:32:21.371 --> 01:32:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his origin story and everything.</v>

2567
01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:27.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that idea that like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no domains of knowledge that you can't </v>

2568
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 1>instantly access and have all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory that you need to be a physical</v>

2569
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:31.720
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books are amazing,</v>

2570
01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but I have to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic books on an Ipad or better because</v>

2571
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the next frame.</v>

2572
01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2573
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You just swipe and then you get the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>

2574
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it in advance.</v>

2575
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're reading the left side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

2576
01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Change and the right side is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion and you're like,</v>

2577
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 1>well I see that and see that shit's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming next.</v>

2578
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Like it's kind of a shitty way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2579
01:32:52.721 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an ipad.</v>

2580
01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2581
01:32:55.361 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2582
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>When you do that thing and now with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like embarrassing as a professor of</v>

2583
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 1>physics at a major university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like $3,000</v>

2584
01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.770

<v Speaker 1>Embarrassing.</v>

2585
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be still brilliant guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I said you have to correct anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2608
01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:43.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really because they called me in.</v>

2609
01:33:43.031 --> 01:33:48.031
<v Speaker 1>So I know Scott Derrick's actually had </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch with or breakfast with Scott </v>

2610
01:33:48.031 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Scott from my first book,</v>

2611
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:49.760
<v Speaker 1>which is about science and religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2612
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:52.180
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got somebody connected us and we'd</v>

2613
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:55.690
<v Speaker 1>been talking for a long time and when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got tapped to do doctor strange,</v>

2614
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:57.490
<v Speaker 1>he contacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the email,</v>

2615
01:33:57.491 --> 01:33:59.120
<v Speaker 1>said marvel wants to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2616
01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2617
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I got out there for a day and met Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 1>fee man.</v>

2618
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>

2619
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:11.160
<v Speaker 1>And so we basically worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to work on to two things for </v>

2620
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:11.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's funny is I never read Dr.</v>

2621
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2622
01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Because I was like a science guy was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Tony Stark or you know,</v>

2623
01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a spiderman or the x men.</v>

2624
01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2625
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh God uses magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think we have to figure out was um,</v>

2626
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 1>first of all that that scene where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>first do the counters,</v>

2627
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the ancient one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2628
01:34:26.651 --> 01:34:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and she has to kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2629
01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:33.060
<v Speaker 1>school him on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more ways to think about the </v>

2630
01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 1>world beyond science and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiverse.</v>

2631
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>written the blog a lot on the </v>

2632
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>multiverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

2633
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so much fun to be in the writer's</v>

2634
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:40.080
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2635
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.010
<v Speaker 1>with them and just like be throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around ideas.</v>

2636
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>No it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll probably never ever happen </v>

2638
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't care.</v>

2639
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to care.</v>

2640
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:51.931
<v Speaker 1>I got my shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a weird thing that when you're </v>

2641
01:34:51.931 --> 01:34:54.811
<v Speaker 1>young you like all this cool stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you get old you're </v>

2642
01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:57.631
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be more pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to abandon that stuff </v>

2643
01:34:57.631 --> 01:35:00.811
<v Speaker 1>and be mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was a kid I was super </v>

2644
01:35:00.811 --> 01:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed when I became an adult that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I still like muscle cars.</v>

2645
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I like these stupid things?</v>

2646
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And I loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see one drive by here,</v>

2647
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the rumble and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2648
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing,</v>

2649
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:14.000
<v Speaker 1>and then when I became an older adult I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2650
01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:15.470
<v Speaker 1>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>

2651
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.220
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm now looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karen's manager,</v>

2652
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:22.450
<v Speaker 1>because I love video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play a lot of video games and people </v>

2653
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:22.450
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2654
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.260
<v Speaker 1>your children.</v>

2655
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2656
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:25.230
<v Speaker 1>awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

2657
01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 1>There is no better way to kill an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after a stressful day then to</v>

2658
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:30.840
<v Speaker 1>go and shoot aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2659
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:31.900
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2660
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:33.410
<v Speaker 1>This stimulates the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2661
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I have talked about this many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

2662
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:40.301
<v Speaker 1>that we have this deep appreciation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>chess and go and all these ancient </v>

2663
01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:44.411
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are games like starcraft and even </v>

2664
01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 1>like one on one quake matches that </v>
<v Speaker 1>require intense calculating.</v>

2665
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about the environment </v>

2666
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:53.800
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the map that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2667
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.280
<v Speaker 1>you're competing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2668
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2669
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.160
<v Speaker 1>that's really good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2670
01:35:57.170 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to be,</v>

2671
01:35:58.191 --> 01:35:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like rpgs.</v>

2672
01:35:59.861 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with a map and everything,</v>

2673
01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:03.390
<v Speaker 1>so one of them everquest dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:05.600
<v Speaker 1>well I don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything multi player.</v>

2675
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm so bad at it that like,</v>

2676
01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some 13 year old in Korea.</v>

2677
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just like your dad or your dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>spawn dies.</v>

2678
01:36:11.621 --> 01:36:16.621
<v Speaker 1>Spawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like something with a really good </v>

2679
01:36:16.621 --> 01:36:16.621
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want,</v>

2684
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Zombie Games because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could scared being scared when I,</v>

2685
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I saw um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do the living versus zombies.</v>

2686
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice simple one that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2687
01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2695
01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.680

<v Speaker 1>but last of us is kind of a Zombie </v>

2696
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 1>survival story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's beautiful.</v>

2697
01:36:51.441 --> 01:36:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really the narrative of it.</v>

2698
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It's this guy your 20 years after and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about this thing,</v>

2699
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:57.640

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2700
01:36:57.650 --> 01:37:00.440
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie outbreak happening and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy loses his daughter,</v>

2701
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:02.690
<v Speaker 1>like you see him lose his daughter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

2702
01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:04.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same company that did,</v>

2703
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:05.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2704
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>uncharted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are other.</v>

2705
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I really like those as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2706
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and so she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acting in it was really beautiful </v>

2707
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2708
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>it's 20 years later and this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

2709
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.360
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just,</v>

2710
01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:14.860
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2711
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.730
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he survived in this,</v>

2712
01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you have the society's falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2713
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2714
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:22.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just track him as he gets this,</v>

2715
01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.640
<v Speaker 1>this young girl who is immune and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to take her cross country to,</v>

2716
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:32.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're following this guy story and </v>

2717
01:37:32.711 --> 01:37:32.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's zombies and there's a,</v>

2718
01:37:32.711 --> 01:37:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the theme of a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really recent movie.</v>

2719
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foreign movie with a Foreign Zombie </v>

2720
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:43.730
<v Speaker 1>movie that was supposed to be very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was the idea behind it.</v>

2721
01:37:43.731 --> 01:37:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was his own daughter wasn't.</v>

2722
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wasn't the fact that they took </v>
<v Speaker 1>it from this because you know,</v>

2723
01:37:48.941 --> 01:37:51.430
<v Speaker 1>so last of us is one like huge amounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of awards.</v>

2724
01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 1>How old is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six years,</v>

2725
01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Month two is just about to come out.</v>

2726
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sports center movies older than </v>

2727
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:02.721
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe because it came out right </v>

2728
01:38:02.721 --> 01:38:05.320
<v Speaker 1>around the time where his wife left him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he banged the maid.</v>

2729
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Downfall.</v>

2730
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the governor then wasn't even the</v>

2731
01:38:12.481 --> 01:38:12.980
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there.</v>

2732
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:14.110
<v Speaker 1>He's posting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was post.</v>

2733
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It was post post governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2734
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theme is a reoccurring theme that </v>

2735
01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.080
<v Speaker 1>is a reoccurrence of telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times is that comeback?</v>

2736
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.710
<v Speaker 1>The plague wipes people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come back to life.</v>

2737
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>There's zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta wonder what's up with that,</v>

2738
01:38:28.051 --> 01:38:30.270
<v Speaker 1>like why is that something that's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>stirring around in our head?</v>

2739
01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:35.271
<v Speaker 1>I think the apocalypse is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of feel nervous about what's </v>

2740
01:38:35.271 --> 01:38:35.271
<v Speaker 1>happening with us because we can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sure.</v>

2741
01:38:35.271 --> 01:38:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Pushing up against boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also vulnerable.</v>

2742
01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Running.</v>

2743
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.780
<v Speaker 1>We're vulnerable to disease and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

2744
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different things that </v>

2745
01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:47.391
<v Speaker 1>people can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabies and malaria plagues we used to </v>

2746
01:38:47.391 --> 01:38:48.510
<v Speaker 1>have plagues all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2747
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:49.950
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2748
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:55.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's what makes this game so great</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it really takes the world after </v>

2749
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

2750
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2751
01:38:57.961 --> 01:38:59.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautifully done,</v>

2752
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:01.140
<v Speaker 1>scarier than Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2753
01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully done.</v>

2754
01:39:02.461 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

2755
01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:08.001
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything that I love mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you're saying is you get </v>

2756
01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 1>into these situations and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get killed.</v>

2757
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:09.300
<v Speaker 1>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dark souls were like,</v>

2758
01:39:09.301 --> 01:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting through dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark souls.</v>

2759
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the most hardest game ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never played it.</v>

2760
01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:15.190
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this game is hard and you got to keep it</v>

2761
01:39:15.191 --> 01:39:17.390
<v Speaker 1>as dark souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark souls is a,</v>

2762
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.990
<v Speaker 1>it's also a story based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2763
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:20.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open world games,</v>

2764
01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:22.110
<v Speaker 1>single player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's probably a multiplayer</v>

2765
01:39:22.111 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 1>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2766
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:25.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2767
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:27.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of an elvish,</v>

2768
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in that kind of world.</v>

2769
01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:30.270
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stay alive.</v>

2770
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like the hardest game </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2771
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2772
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2773
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I said a good hard game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you know,</v>

2774
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you can keep going back like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2775
01:39:38.671 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2776
01:39:39.871 --> 01:39:41.590
<v Speaker 1>let me try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me try coming around from this side,</v>

2777
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2778
01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:43.740
<v Speaker 1>let me use this weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get on this.</v>

2779
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It's really that we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2780
01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:45.890
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2781
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:50.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a text book that just came out a </v>

2782
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.910
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago and we did a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

2783
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 1>We built a full first ever full video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game for an intro astronomy course.</v>

2784
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And the whole idea was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coolest thing about a game is like </v>

2785
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to do is learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>

2786
01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes being in a game </v>

2787
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:02.990
<v Speaker 1>world interest there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2788
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole set of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got know how to craft.</v>

2789
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:06.480
<v Speaker 1>You got to know which weapons to use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of situations.</v>

2790
01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And our idea with the video game was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2791
01:40:08.311 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 1>just make the real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real rules make um,</v>

2792
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the science rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2793
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go mine an asteroid?</v>

2794
01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know which asteroid has,</v>

2795
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2796
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2797
01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2798
01:40:16.141 --> 01:40:17.030
<v Speaker 1>or in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2799
01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do normally do an astronomy.</v>

2800
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2801
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:23.490
<v Speaker 1>video games have not recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't,</v>

2802
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:28.550
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand actually how </v>

2803
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:29.730
<v Speaker 1>important they are for teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all kinds of things.</v>

2804
01:40:29.731 --> 01:40:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Video Games and for entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2805
01:40:31.041 --> 01:40:33.030
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a future of storytelling to.</v>

2806
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Well people take them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's a waste of time </v>

2807
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.750
<v Speaker 1>until they find out how much these </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals make it.</v>

2808
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.360
<v Speaker 1>So saying that some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2809
01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 1>what is the number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kid was making $500,000</v>

2810
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:47.770
<v Speaker 1>a month playing fortnite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that what Sean,</v>

2811
01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.820
<v Speaker 1>that sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's way more than that.</v>

2812
01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:52.030
<v Speaker 1>He makes more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is fortnight you?</v>

2813
01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Can somebody explain fortnight to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2814
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm still in far cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five crazy third person shooter.</v>

2815
01:40:57.221 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 3>You're jumping around shooting be boomed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with third person shooters.</v>

2816
01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.920
<v Speaker 3>But like is it a story or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

2817
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got other people people up.</v>

2818
01:41:03.311 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I think the story is really just drop it</v>
<v Speaker 3>into survive.</v>

2819
01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no campaign mode or if they're </v>

2820
01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:11.580
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

2821
01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:11.580
<v Speaker 3>but that's a separate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not whatever.</v>

2822
01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting to me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortnight.</v>

2823
01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:16.370
<v Speaker 3>The graphics suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you.</v>

2824
01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:19.170
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a graphic style that those hit at</v>

2825
01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:21.920
<v Speaker 3>that it has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2826
01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>xbox to sort of.</v>

2827
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had a,</v>

2828
01:41:25.511 --> 01:41:28.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an image and it was from 2007.</v>

2829
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 3>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2830
01:41:29.921 --> 01:41:34.921
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what video games are going to </v>

2831
01:41:34.921 --> 01:41:37.410
<v Speaker 3>be looking like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The graphics gonna be looking like a </v>

2832
01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:39.341
<v Speaker 3>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it shows fort night and it's </v>

2833
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:39.341
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

2834
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:39.341
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just like,</v>

2835
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:40.090
<v Speaker 3>they've turned the textures off.</v>

2836
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:45.450
<v Speaker 3>They 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You turned the textures off when you </v>

2837
01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.401
<v Speaker 3>play online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a powerful enough </v>

2838
01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:47.401
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure you don't like claiming.</v>

2839
01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't make your streaming,</v>

2840
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make your video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Video card works so hard,</v>

2841
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 3>but also it makes it easier to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 3>shapes because they're not like,</v>

2842
01:41:55.660 --> 01:42:00.660
<v Speaker 3>that was the thing that did with quake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would completely turn the textures </v>

2843
01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.841
<v Speaker 3>off when guys would be like playing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high level matches and you would just </v>

2844
01:42:03.841 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 3>deal with these flat walls and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>object,</v>

2845
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:07.450
<v Speaker 3>the person that you were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

2846
01:42:07.451 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 3>what they would stand out and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>contrast.</v>

2847
01:42:09.641 --> 01:42:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2848
01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2849
01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:16.441
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you'd be in this castle wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have the incredible textures on </v>

2850
01:42:16.441 --> 01:42:18.650
<v Speaker 3>the wall and you wouldn't be able to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>them as easily too distracting.</v>

2851
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the thing I think I love </v>

2852
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:23.990
<v Speaker 3>about video games too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like the scenery,</v>

2853
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:27.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I just want to stop and be </v>

2854
01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:27.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2855
01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:30.810
<v Speaker 3>The right side has full graphics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so it depends on what you were </v>

2856
01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:31.120
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right side is reasonable.</v>

2857
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean it still is a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not much different at all.</v>

2858
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2859
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean sort of the left side is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark.</v>

2860
01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.960
<v Speaker 3>There's grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2861
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Look at the graph building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still some movement on the </v>

2862
01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:46.450
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not flat plain like it isn't quick.</v>

2863
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.890
<v Speaker 3>Go to quake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

2864
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:51.310
<v Speaker 3>go to quake three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no textures.</v>

2865
01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Make a video or pull up a video of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll see what I'm talking about </v>

2866
01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:01.051
<v Speaker 3>when I'm talking about is like literal </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat walls where people turned </v>

2867
01:43:01.051 --> 01:43:05.431
<v Speaker 3>everything off and it got to a point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they weren't allowing it and </v>

2868
01:43:05.431 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 3>certain competitions because it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a big difference because now you're</v>

2869
01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:12.331
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a target in front of a blank </v>

2870
01:43:12.331 --> 01:43:12.331
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also,</v>

2871
01:43:12.331 --> 01:43:14.770
<v Speaker 3>you could also replace all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters with a larger character,</v>

2872
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.040
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you were playing as this </v>

2873
01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:20.040
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I get this one.</v>

2874
01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It's showing the mod in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm thinking,</v>

2875
01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2876
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm losers quake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of.</v>

2877
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Or you pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2878
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2879
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:31.960
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull up,</v>

2880
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:33.720
<v Speaker 3>quake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no textures,</v>

2881
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:35.440
<v Speaker 3>pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quake,</v>

2882
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:40.470
<v Speaker 3>no textures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you could watch what it looks </v>

2883
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.470
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not.</v>

2884
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.960
<v Speaker 3>No textures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's different.</v>

2885
01:43:40.961 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 3>You can see the difference in the colors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things are moving.</v>

2886
01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:46.660
<v Speaker 3>It's when they turn off all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>textures,</v>

2887
01:43:46.661 --> 01:43:48.640
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to see these flat.</v>

2888
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it looks like.</v>

2889
01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2890
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Now that is a way different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be much easier to see.</v>

2891
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see those still exist,</v>

2892
01:43:57.950 --> 01:44:02.950
<v Speaker 3>but all the textures are gone and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>show a video that see if you could find </v>

2893
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:07.181
<v Speaker 3>a video that jamie when in the videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see things moving around with no </v>

2894
01:44:07.181 --> 01:44:11.321
<v Speaker 3>textures and you realize what an </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage it would be if you were </v>

2895
01:44:11.321 --> 01:44:11.321
<v Speaker 3>playing someone who's.</v>

2896
01:44:11.321 --> 01:44:13.130
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly dealing with all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual input.</v>

2897
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You have all this different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high visibility and quake three that </v>

2898
01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:18.480
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this.</v>

2899
01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Which game is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quake live.</v>

2900
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2901
01:44:20.811 --> 01:44:23.030
<v Speaker 3>This is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still got to ask what is quick?</v>

2902
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:28.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I've heard of it but I've never </v>

2903
01:44:28.031 --> 01:44:29.261
<v Speaker 3>played it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's the ultimate first person </v>

2904
01:44:29.261 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 3>shooter and it's the original one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was originally quake one and.</v>

2905
01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Well there was doom but it was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of like I've even,</v>

2906
01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:35.500
<v Speaker 3>we did doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't they?</v>

2907
01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:40.501
<v Speaker 3>They came out with another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they come out with another </v>

2908
01:44:40.501 --> 01:44:40.501
<v Speaker 3>version of Dune?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes they did.</v>

2909
01:44:40.501 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And there's another one that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out soon.</v>

2910
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what quake one was,</v>

2911
01:44:44.061 --> 01:44:49.061
<v Speaker 3>was these cool maps and you run around </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shoot each other and you'd have </v>

2912
01:44:49.061 --> 01:44:53.441
<v Speaker 3>these death matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one on one death matches and shoot </v>

2913
01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:53.441
<v Speaker 3>rockets at each other and shit.</v>

2914
01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:57.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing it through your </v>

2915
01:44:57.730 --> 01:44:57.730
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2916
01:44:57.730 --> 01:45:01.001
<v Speaker 3>so if you have a rocket launcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the rocket launcher in front of </v>

2917
01:45:01.001 --> 01:45:01.001
<v Speaker 3>you are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that whole idea,</v>

2918
01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:02.100
<v Speaker 3>what does this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2919
01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.610
<v Speaker 3>this is quake champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the newest version.</v>

2920
01:45:04.611 --> 01:45:09.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the graphics are fucking incredible on </v>

2921
01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:09.611
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they,</v>

2922
01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 3>they're so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna have.</v>

2923
01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:13.790
<v Speaker 3>We're setting up a land here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a local area network here.</v>

2924
01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:16.400
<v Speaker 3>What we're going to stream live and play</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2925
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Excellent and a waste massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2926
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.640
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure I'm going to go bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'm sorta like,</v>

2927
01:45:22.641 --> 01:45:27.641
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three hours just went going to go to </v>

2928
01:45:27.641 --> 01:45:27.641
<v Speaker 3>sleep a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2929
01:45:27.641 --> 01:45:28.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever do it will suck up your time.</v>

2930
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.360
<v Speaker 3>It'll suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2931
01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:30.440
<v Speaker 3>I can't play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2932
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good enough to play those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

2933
01:45:32.311 --> 01:45:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just like spawn dice bond guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>can figure out how to do it.</v>

2934
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 3>You're a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you say that?</v>

2935
01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:40.990
<v Speaker 3>You put the limitations on myself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2936
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:46.080
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just need to learn left wasd.</v>

2937
01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Learn how to move your fingers around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The console's are bullshit.</v>

2938
01:45:51.921 --> 01:45:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people say,</v>

2939
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't get any real accuracy with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>console.</v>

2940
01:45:55.431 --> 01:45:57.710
<v Speaker 3>That's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you do with the finger?</v>

2941
01:45:57.711 --> 01:45:58.830
<v Speaker 3>That type?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the console now.</v>

2942
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can send to you.</v>

2943
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 3>How do you learn physics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you.</v>

2944
01:46:02.301 --> 01:46:06.380
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this fucking movie.</v>

2945
01:46:06.381 --> 01:46:07.310
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it,</v>

2946
01:46:07.311 --> 01:46:08.060
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

2947
01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like rocky or something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to karate kid or whatever.</v>

2948
01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Hasn't been ever done that for video </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

2949
01:46:13.191 --> 01:46:16.280
<v Speaker 3>He's never been that movie where someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>teaches someone how to play a video game</v>

2950
01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:18.920
<v Speaker 3>nerd in the beginning and he's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>loser,</v>

2951
01:46:18.921 --> 01:46:20.660
<v Speaker 3>but you know it comes back and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl.</v>

2952
01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I wanted to talk </v>

2953
01:46:25.690 --> 01:46:27.311
<v Speaker 3>to you about this in particular is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I am more and more convinced </v>

2954
01:46:27.311 --> 01:46:31.481
<v Speaker 3>that it's our future may lie in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificially created world and that </v>

2955
01:46:31.971 --> 01:46:36.971
<v Speaker 3>people are more interested and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted everyday to virtual reality,</v>

2956
01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:40.550
<v Speaker 3>augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality,</v>

2957
01:46:40.551 --> 01:46:42.530
<v Speaker 3>and what can change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that game?</v>

2958
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:47.270
<v Speaker 3>That one game where there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you created worlds.</v>

2959
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.630
<v Speaker 3>I was going to pull that up earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask.</v>

2960
01:46:48.650 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 3>It's called no man's sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2961
01:46:49.921 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2962
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.180
<v Speaker 1>played that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played that.</v>

2963
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I bought it because of course any space </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

2964
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like whoring though it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2965
01:46:55.410 --> 01:46:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they have 80 trillion worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all this.</v>

2966
01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 1>They're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't look that different,</v>

2967
01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like oatmeal,</v>

2968
01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:00.960
<v Speaker 1>$80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million bottles</v>

2969
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go there and people are shooting </v>

2970
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 2>each other and stealing money.</v>

2971
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2972
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:08.700
<v Speaker 1>What is better for that kind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2973
01:47:08.710 --> 01:47:09.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2974
01:47:09.401 --> 01:47:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like it was people,</v>

2975
01:47:10.451 --> 01:47:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but what's better is I'm elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous.</v>

2976
01:47:12.970 --> 01:47:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So after this I was so disappointed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2977
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:17.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back and I found a leap.</v>

2978
01:47:17.441 --> 01:47:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is disappointing because there was</v>

2979
01:47:19.571 --> 01:47:20.530
<v Speaker 1>no action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2980
01:47:20.531 --> 01:47:22.660
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just ran around and your mind stuff.</v>

2981
01:47:22.661 --> 01:47:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't nothing exciting.</v>

2982
01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.180
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

2983
01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.510
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2984
01:47:28.511 --> 01:47:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually play sort of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive multiplayer games.</v>

2985
01:47:31.061 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 1>So this is elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous is elite.</v>

2986
01:47:32.590 --> 01:47:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous end of this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trading or you know,</v>

2987
01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you can decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I want to be a,</v>

2988
01:47:36.581 --> 01:47:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a bounty hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2989
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And it was so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2990
01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:46.621
<v Speaker 1>I spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a good six months of my </v>

2991
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:46.621
<v Speaker 1>life that I was working my way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting better ships.</v>

2992
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I became because who doesn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bounty hunter?</v>

2993
01:47:47.681 --> 01:47:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2994
01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what everybody's and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>just this game had you know,</v>

2995
01:47:51.311 --> 01:47:51.960
<v Speaker 1>and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2996
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred thousand people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're creating the universe.</v>

2997
01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They add storylines.</v>

2998
01:47:57.310 --> 01:48:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we are setting up an htc vive here</v>

2999
01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

3000
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Danny was htc vive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

3001
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3002
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call your nerd,</v>

3003
01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:16.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will never not have sex in virtual </v>

3004
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:16.140
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3005
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:20.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's consumer virtual reality when </v>

3006
01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:20.960
<v Speaker 2>my friends never done the boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3007
01:48:20.970 --> 01:48:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been waiting.</v>

3008
01:48:21.711 --> 01:48:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I've been sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3009
01:48:23.121 --> 01:48:26.720
<v Speaker 2>we tried to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie went out yesterday and look,</v>

3010
01:48:26.721 --> 01:48:29.570
<v Speaker 2>they're all sold out so we had to order </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and so we're ordering one.</v>

3011
01:48:29.571 --> 01:48:31.310
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have it set up in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3012
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3013
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the Games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played the games of two years ago and </v>

3014
01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're way more advanced than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are now.</v>

3015
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:43.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a crazy archery game where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the top of a castle and these </v>

3016
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:46.130
<v Speaker 2>little monsters that look like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be in south park.</v>

3017
01:48:46.131 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 2>They're not like detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3018
01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Kinda cool looking monsters and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot out on with bows and arrows that </v>

3019
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 2>are trying to invade the castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

3020
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 2>it's addictive because you really look </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

3021
01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:57.560
<v Speaker 2>you see them all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have like a real.</v>

3022
01:48:57.730 --> 01:49:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So how did they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just always been my question about like,</v>

3023
01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:05.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit on my chair and I play my video </v>

3024
01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:05.071
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like our.</v>

3025
01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3026
01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>see this guy has a thing in his hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's moving around.</v>

3027
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:12.891
<v Speaker 2>This is like a star wars one and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different ones that I've </v>

3028
01:49:12.891 --> 01:49:13.290
<v Speaker 2>always got to be standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3029
01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:14.400
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3030
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to just like sit down with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>borrower and Ken,</v>

3031
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:20.400
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a boxing one that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a real workout in.</v>

3032
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's a game and I played it over </v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan's house.</v>

3033
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:28.110
<v Speaker 2>We think there's a video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's weird because you punch wrong.</v>

3034
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3035
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.620
<v Speaker 2>the like if I'm holding my hands like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3036
01:49:31.621 --> 01:49:34.470
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding my hands vertically where my</v>

3037
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 2>thumbs are up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3038
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:41.090
<v Speaker 2>The boxing gloves would be horizontal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would be if you were punching </v>

3039
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:42.180
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3040
01:49:42.190 --> 01:49:43.660
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't do the turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3041
01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:48.710
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you move your hands forward like </v>

3042
01:49:48.710 --> 01:49:51.321
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you really wouldn't punch like </v>

3043
01:49:51.321 --> 01:49:51.321
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3044
01:49:51.321 --> 01:49:53.760
<v Speaker 3>the punches come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've got an iron that I was going </v>

3045
01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.710
<v Speaker 3>to say that'll be something that'll work</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and that and make the,</v>

3046
01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:57.370
<v Speaker 3>the controller rotate the way a fist </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

3047
01:49:57.730 --> 01:50:02.730
<v Speaker 3>But as you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you throw real punches and someone's </v>

3048
01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:03.010
<v Speaker 3>throwing punches at you and when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw punches you and they hit you,</v>

3049
01:50:03.011 --> 01:50:05.300
<v Speaker 3>you see a white flash in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

3050
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Makes you nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like real sparring does.</v>

3051
01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3052
01:50:09.151 --> 01:50:14.151
<v Speaker 3>And so like this question of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do with virtual </v>

3053
01:50:14.151 --> 01:50:14.151
<v Speaker 3>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like I said,</v>

3054
01:50:14.151 --> 01:50:14.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already,</v>

3055
01:50:14.151 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see huge potential for like education </v>

3056
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:19.040
<v Speaker 3>in gaming and that's why we built our </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

3057
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

3058
01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:24.220
<v Speaker 3>this is me over Duncan's house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the one anybody to walk by.</v>

3059
01:50:24.221 --> 01:50:25.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go get a beer.</v>

3060
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating this guy up.</v>

3061
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Moving around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3062
01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:34.261
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing I've always wondered </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that guy was fucking duck enough</v>

3063
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:35.560
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>move around,</v>

3066
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.490
<v Speaker 3>don't stand right in front of the rope a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dope.</v>

3067
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa,</v>

3068
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa have footwork and movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can really get a workout with </v>

3069
01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:48.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not joking.</v>

3070
01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:50.850
<v Speaker 3>You get exhausted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3071
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 3>you keep going and fight a tougher and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tougher opponents.</v>

3072
01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3073
01:50:55.121 --> 01:50:55.820
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the way,</v>

3074
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:57.270
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like talk about haptic suits.</v>

3075
01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Like eventually you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to wear things.</v>

3076
01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the book but I didn't see the uh,</v>

3077
01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:03.780
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The movie ready?</v>

3078
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready player one.</v>

3079
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see you.</v>

3080
01:51:05.970 --> 01:51:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever read the book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The book's really good because the book </v>

3081
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:10.970
<v Speaker 3>is like full immersion.</v>

3082
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole book is about like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality is it and so everybody </v>

3083
01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:17.581
<v Speaker 3>has these suits that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and you're kind of in this </v>

3084
01:51:17.581 --> 01:51:19.291
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you play the game and so he can run and </v>

3085
01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:19.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3086
01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:19.291
<v Speaker 3>but in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3087
01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:20.620
<v Speaker 3>we're just starting out along these </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

3088
01:51:20.621 --> 01:51:25.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these places you can go that </v>

3089
01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:25.621
<v Speaker 3>they have a warehouse set up and you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of it.</v>

3090
01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:29.971
<v Speaker 3>And I went through one with my kids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a star wars one at Disneyland,</v>

3091
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking why you go across.</v>

3092
01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:38.820
<v Speaker 3>You're walking across this platform like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have all these different places </v>

3093
01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 3>where you actually walk through and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're walking through,</v>

3094
01:51:39.431 --> 01:51:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you looked to the left and to the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's fire,</v>

3095
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 3>but you feel the heat from the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3096
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Like heater set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that blows up.</v>

3097
01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:49.090
<v Speaker 3>And Storm troopers start shooting at </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3098
01:51:49.091 --> 01:51:50.800
<v Speaker 3>This is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it called?</v>

3099
01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.150
<v Speaker 3>The void.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The void.</v>

3100
01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3101
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 3>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you man,</v>

3102
01:51:55.241 --> 01:52:00.241
<v Speaker 3>this is better than any of the rides at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland and it's just outside of </v>

3103
01:52:00.241 --> 01:52:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland in downtown Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have to pay to get into get</v>

3104
01:52:02.370 --> 01:52:03.610
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it costs,</v>

3105
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it's $35 for a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not cheap,</v>

3106
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not too bad.</v>

3107
01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Like it's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is awesome.</v>

3108
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:14.790
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is what happens with the</v>

3109
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:16.000
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3110
01:52:16.001 --> 01:52:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Because you have virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just on the cusp of,</v>

3111
01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:22.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just beginning to like start </v>

3112
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.021
<v Speaker 3>playing around with these technologies </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people have been saying it for </v>

3113
01:52:25.021 --> 01:52:25.021
<v Speaker 3>years and it kind of sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of clunky.</v>

3114
01:52:25.021 --> 01:52:25.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3115
01:52:25.021 --> 01:52:26.080
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to play Pong,</v>

3116
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3117
01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what I started with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a 55.</v>

3118
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:31.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I remember Pong.</v>

3119
01:52:31.991 --> 01:52:34.810
<v Speaker 3>We were excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm controlling the TV,</v>

3120
01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:40.590
<v Speaker 3>making the thing move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The TV or asteroids flew the Star Wars </v>

3121
01:52:40.631 --> 01:52:41.620
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called asteroids,</v>

3122
01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:45.120
<v Speaker 3>but you flew through the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking wire frame,</v>

3123
01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:48.200
<v Speaker 3>but it was amazing time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dropped a lot of quarters.</v>

3124
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go from that to what you were showing</v>

3125
01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>us here with these crazy new space games</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then imagine what these mean.</v>

3126
01:52:56.181 --> 01:52:59.000
<v Speaker 3>The Star Wars thing today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The void is really cool,</v>

3127
01:52:59.390 --> 01:53:02.330
<v Speaker 3>but you know that it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's cool,</v>

3128
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not real.</v>

3129
01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to tell.</v>

3130
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:06.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not real and 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3131
01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how much time are you spending suit,</v>

3132
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 3>by the way when you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3133
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:13.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the pressure of you and you feel</v>

3134
01:53:13.171 --> 01:53:14.360
<v Speaker 3>that when you getting shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

3135
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3136
01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:20.130
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even with the controller on my crappy ps</v>

3137
01:53:20.131 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 3>four who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3138
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:22.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it vibrates,</v>

3139
01:53:22.461 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of give you,</v>

3140
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:29.830
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how much the brain sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>picks up on these signals when you're </v>

3141
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:30.470
<v Speaker 3>using the htc vive and you draw the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow back.</v>

3142
01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.160
<v Speaker 3>When it gets to the nocking point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it like it's cool.</v>

3143
01:53:34.450 --> 01:53:37.780
<v Speaker 3>You release is a feeling in your hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the Arrow.</v>

3144
01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3145
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3146
01:53:40.810 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be sort of like,</v>

3147
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:42.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grandpa,</v>

3148
01:53:42.361 --> 01:53:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but like terrible people shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>going out in nature,</v>

3149
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:46.790
<v Speaker 3>which I think they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should,</v>

3150
01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3151
01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3152
01:53:48.171 --> 01:53:48.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

3153
01:53:48.681 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm always aware whenever I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3154
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna be terrible.</v>

3155
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I always remember the whole you can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>in like,</v>

3156
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I think at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socrates,</v>

3157
01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five years,</v>

3158
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:57.230
<v Speaker 3>500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3159
01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids to do the robots.</v>

3160
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:00.300
<v Speaker 3>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3161
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.160
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3162
01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:02.810
<v Speaker 3>who knows what we'll do with it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3163
01:54:02.811 --> 01:54:03.540
<v Speaker 3>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3164
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3165
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:05.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3166
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that's terrible,</v>

3167
01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:10.780
<v Speaker 3>but there clearly are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous with this.</v>

3168
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.410
<v Speaker 3>A different game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie doesn't new one.</v>

3169
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be fucked.</v>

3170
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:18.200
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3171
01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 3>just the hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3172
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:23.480
<v Speaker 3>And so your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have two little hand controllers and</v>

3173
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:28.481
<v Speaker 3>one of them would be the Arrow and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one would be the bow and you were </v>

3174
01:54:28.481 --> 01:54:28.481
<v Speaker 3>them and that's the haptic part in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italy.</v>

3175
01:54:28.481 --> 01:54:29.360
<v Speaker 3>There's controllers on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3176
01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:34.361
<v Speaker 3>you feel the Arrow vibrating against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>riser of the blow as you draw it back </v>

3177
01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:36.380
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

3178
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Well it's funny because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about like,</v>

3179
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the game that we built,</v>

3180
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 3>which was awesome.</v>

3181
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 3>It was really a lot of fun to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through the process of like,</v>

3182
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:46.220
<v Speaker 3>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you script it,</v>

3183
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:47.810
<v Speaker 3>how do you teach people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3184
01:54:47.811 --> 01:54:52.811
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that whole thing that when we </v>

3185
01:54:52.811 --> 01:54:52.811
<v Speaker 3>get into when you're a good game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3186
01:54:52.811 --> 01:54:55.661
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the first couple hours of a game </v>

3187
01:54:55.661 --> 01:54:55.661
<v Speaker 3>and you're just learning the basic stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get excited like,</v>

3188
01:54:55.661 --> 01:54:55.661
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3189
01:54:55.661 --> 01:54:57.230
<v Speaker 3>this is a cool world to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3190
01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.200
<v Speaker 3>but I'd be interested to think sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3191
01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:02.630
<v Speaker 3>at some point to try vr for the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing because what you want,</v>

3192
01:55:02.631 --> 01:55:05.300
<v Speaker 3>you can have people be tacked on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not just sort of in their head,</v>

3193
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.070
<v Speaker 3>what else can you do to show to show </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3194
01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.720
<v Speaker 3>teach them things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like glaciers or you know,</v>

3195
01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:10.490
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3196
01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Well that's another thing in Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a thing called soaring over </v>

3197
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:19.061
<v Speaker 3>the world that you sit in a chair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get raised up and there's a giant </v>

3198
01:55:19.061 --> 01:55:21.830
<v Speaker 3>like imax style screen and it flies you </v>
<v Speaker 3>over these environments.</v>

3199
01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:23.900
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So beautiful.</v>

3200
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 3>And you have different smells are in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>air and the different places that you go</v>

3201
01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:29.070
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you go over the Allergan.</v>

3202
01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elephants.</v>

3203
01:55:30.081 --> 01:55:33.210
<v Speaker 3>You smell grass and hay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3204
01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's just a matter of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as we were talking about before,</v>

3205
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 3>where biological entities might not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for space travel,</v>

3206
01:55:41.421 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to send a robot put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a suit and be able to</v>

3207
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>experience these worlds like in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3208
01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3209
01:55:47.441 --> 01:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3210
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3211
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:52.890
<v Speaker 1>the simulation argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the philosophy arguing about the,</v>

3212
01:55:52.891 --> 01:55:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a really interesting idea.</v>

3213
01:55:54.871 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Should we just run through it for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't know it?</v>

3214
01:55:57.210 --> 01:55:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So I forgot who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Bostrom now,</v>

3215
01:55:59.311 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe not Brandon Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3216
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:05.811
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy philosopher came with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this brilliant argument for like why </v>

3217
01:56:05.811 --> 01:56:09.981
<v Speaker 1>we're probably a simulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're probably somebody else's </v>

3218
01:56:09.981 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 1>simulation self-aware simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is like,</v>

3219
01:56:10.021 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get one,</v>

3220
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:15.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about like </v>

3221
01:56:15.921 --> 01:56:15.921
<v Speaker 1>civilizations when they get a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ahead,</v>

3222
01:56:15.921 --> 01:56:16.800
<v Speaker 1>what can they do that they're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful?</v>

3223
01:56:16.801 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 1>They can build computers that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulate reality,</v>

3224
01:56:20.071 --> 01:56:21.560
<v Speaker 1>like fully simulate reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

3225
01:56:21.561 --> 01:56:22.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like in the matrix,</v>

3226
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you have programs that are self aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

3227
01:56:24.691 --> 01:56:29.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they get to that and they start </v>

3228
01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:29.691
<v Speaker 1>running simulations in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3229
01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it's cheaper to run.</v>

3230
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It's cheap to run simulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just run trillions of them.</v>

3231
01:56:32.341 --> 01:56:37.341
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that from that argument </v>

3232
01:56:37.341 --> 01:56:40.080
<v Speaker 1>there's more simulated realities then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the one real reality.</v>

3233
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.940
<v Speaker 1>So odds are right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3234
01:56:41.941 --> 01:56:44.970
<v Speaker 1>if there's a trillion simulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities in one real reality,</v>

3235
01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you're probably in a simulated reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>are we a,</v>

3236
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like right now you,</v>

3237
01:56:49.651 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3238
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but what we are is an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed and we are self aware programs </v>

3239
01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:56.590
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3240
01:56:56.730 --> 01:56:59.160
<v Speaker 1>silicon matrix of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3241
01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that argument is brilliant.</v>

3242
01:57:01.621 --> 01:57:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3243
01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.600
<v Speaker 1>just from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just from the point of view of like </v>

3244
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:07.600
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3245
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:08.560
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of reasons to say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not possible but,</v>

3246
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3247
01:57:09.091 --> 01:57:10.740
<v Speaker 1>raises this issue of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3248
01:57:10.741 --> 01:57:12.810
<v Speaker 1>what is simulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you were in a simulation,</v>

3249
01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:17.811
<v Speaker 1>the whole matrix thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were in a simulation that was </v>

3250
01:57:17.811 --> 01:57:20.571
<v Speaker 1>that real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you know now how could you </v>

3251
01:57:20.571 --> 01:57:22.260
<v Speaker 1>know they're going to be if you allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology to continue,</v>

3252
01:57:22.261 --> 01:57:22.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3253
01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:25.290
<v Speaker 1>If we keep moving forward at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential pace,</v>

3254
01:57:25.291 --> 01:57:30.291
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna come a point in time where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have something that's </v>

3255
01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:30.960
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we know that we're not already</v>

3256
01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:32.910
<v Speaker 1>in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we're in it,</v>

3257
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:37.940
<v Speaker 1>will we create another reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will we continue to create simulations </v>

3258
01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:39.570
<v Speaker 1>inside of simulations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fractals,</v>

3259
01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:42.960
<v Speaker 1>fractals exist in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exist everywhere in the universe.</v>

3260
01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:48.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the argument that the </v>

3261
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 1>atomic structure itself might really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a universe,</v>

3262
01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3263
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is super standard talk.</v>

3264
01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really.</v>

3265
01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3266
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that's why I love science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3267
01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 1>the explorations of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3268
01:57:58.531 --> 01:58:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're way out there and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>an exercises,</v>

3269
01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>exercises and there's a way in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3270
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:05.970
<v Speaker 1>when you think a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million years in the future,</v>

3271
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:08.310
<v Speaker 1>this is why I hate the loop this back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

3272
01:58:08.311 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 1>but just like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could just make it through,</v>

3273
01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows what we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

3274
01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the,</v>

3275
01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:18.590
<v Speaker 1>there's the whole universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I did like about interstellar </v>

3276
01:58:18.590 --> 01:58:20.780
<v Speaker 1>was the idea that like our future cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which have now become integrated,</v>

3277
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the very fabric of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3278
01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:28.250
<v Speaker 1>that's how far you've evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become the laws of physics that </v>

3279
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.680
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of opening up the wormhole </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

3280
01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:29.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3281
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:34.730
<v Speaker 1>a million years is so long as he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can become and it's just like,</v>

3282
01:58:35.491 --> 01:58:37.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hold this back.</v>

3283
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3284
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the people that deny </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

3285
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 3>but one thing I am a fan of is watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>them do it.</v>

3286
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I like watching monkeys throw shit at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the zoo,</v>

3287
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 3>just something weird about watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>people argue like really obvious,</v>

3288
01:58:53.741 --> 01:58:55.540
<v Speaker 3>right wing talking points and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3289
01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:00.840
<v Speaker 3>and most of them by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no financial interest in climate </v>

3290
01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.590
<v Speaker 3>change one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

3291
01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:07.680
<v Speaker 3>they're not the wealthy elite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are these Weirdos that are like </v>

3292
01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:11.370
<v Speaker 3>vampire familiars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they want to be recognized as like </v>

3293
01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:11.830
<v Speaker 3>an eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ally of the elite.</v>

3294
01:59:11.831 --> 01:59:13.380
<v Speaker 3>They think somehow under that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get.</v>

3295
01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:14.990
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3296
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:17.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

3297
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again it's the tribalism,</v>

3298
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.420
<v Speaker 3>but as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like watching them do this and the </v>

3299
01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:23.530
<v Speaker 3>part that's so frustrating is just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3300
01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using science.</v>

3301
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:27.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're like,</v>

3302
01:59:27.211 --> 01:59:28.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get like,</v>

3303
01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get into an accident and you're </v>

3304
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

3305
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 3>please give me the MRI.</v>

3306
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3307
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:37.980
<v Speaker 3>as soon as your arm healed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be tweeting about how </v>

3308
01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:37.980
<v Speaker 3>climate change is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth is flat.</v>

3309
01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure what to do with that.</v>

3310
01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this something we should pay </v>

3311
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 3>attention to her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should we just be like,</v>

3312
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3313
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:47.530
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead,</v>

3314
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 3>do your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't interesting.</v>

3315
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:54.211
<v Speaker 3>Conversation with Neil degrasse Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and he said one of the real </v>

3316
01:59:54.211 --> 01:59:56.941
<v Speaker 3>problems with debating these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevate their profile and they're never </v>

3317
01:59:56.941 --> 01:59:59.911
<v Speaker 3>going to believe in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is there's a mental illness </v>

3318
01:59:59.911 --> 02:00:01.720
<v Speaker 3>involved in a lot of these people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>

3319
02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believed this and then there's </v>

3320
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:10.671
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this massive lack of education </v>

3321
02:00:10.671 --> 02:00:13.920
<v Speaker 3>and lack of reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not interested in understanding </v>

3322
02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.090
<v Speaker 3>how they know that the earth is round or</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they know that every other planet in</v>

3323
02:00:16.091 --> 02:00:21.091
<v Speaker 3>the solar system is round or how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that every other planet that we've </v>

3324
02:00:21.091 --> 02:00:23.971
<v Speaker 3>observed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stars are around why they're </v>

3325
02:00:23.971 --> 02:00:26.251
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it's a matter of mass and gravity </v>

3326
02:00:26.251 --> 02:00:26.251
<v Speaker 3>and all these.</v>

3327
02:00:26.251 --> 02:00:29.910
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they don't want to think </v>

3328
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:30.490
<v Speaker 3>because the government as if it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is like one cabal.</v>

3329
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Equally minded people that are all </v>

3330
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.100
<v Speaker 3>working together to fuck you over </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow by convincing you that the earth</v>

3331
02:00:36.101 --> 02:00:38.830
<v Speaker 3>is round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is one of the dumbest things,</v>

3332
02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:44.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a sign that we've created </v>
<v Speaker 3>this world that's really easy to survive</v>

3333
02:00:44.741 --> 02:00:49.741
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've nerved all the hard edges and we </v>

3334
02:00:49.741 --> 02:00:50.340
<v Speaker 3>keep the wolves off the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still these fucking dumb dumbs.</v>

3335
02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they get online with computers,</v>

3336
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.460
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3337
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 3>So these idiots did research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what'd you looked at?</v>

3338
02:00:57.371 --> 02:01:00.090
<v Speaker 3>A website like youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two videos.</v>

3339
02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3340
02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:03.250
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of stunning.</v>

3341
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well actually,</v>

3342
02:01:04.001 --> 02:01:09.001
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think your point about actually we've </v>

3343
02:01:09.001 --> 02:01:09.001
<v Speaker 3>made the world so safe because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain way like it,</v>

3344
02:01:09.001 --> 02:01:14.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a hunter gatherer or those people </v>

3345
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.531
<v Speaker 3>would be food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people who were standing </v>

3346
02:01:16.531 --> 02:01:16.531
<v Speaker 3>there looking at the tiger being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a tiger.</v>

3347
02:01:16.531 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3348
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:19.710
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3349
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:22.060
<v Speaker 3>so and it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's weird about that?</v>

3350
02:01:22.061 --> 02:01:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So that is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3351
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:26.170
<v Speaker 3>that like that is the dumbest shit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could possibly imagine.</v>

3352
02:01:26.171 --> 02:01:27.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but oh,</v>

3353
02:01:27.190 --> 02:01:28.480
<v Speaker 3>there's dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Gosh.</v>

3354
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Dumber people think there's aliens </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath the earth and there's </v>

3355
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Reptilians a secret cabal of kid fuckers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that run the world.</v>

3356
02:01:38.861 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 3>And you made</v>

3357
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>a really excellent point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just admitted to go,</v>

3358
02:01:41.751 --> 02:01:46.751
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is like the philosopher Karl </v>

3359
02:01:46.751 --> 02:01:46.751
<v Speaker 1>popper once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a conspiracy,</v>

3360
02:01:46.751 --> 02:01:46.751
<v Speaker 1>it failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3361
02:01:46.751 --> 02:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>The whole conspiracy thing is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3362
02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>everybody's in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3363
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>as if like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3364
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>there are the powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the ones who control,</v>

3365
02:01:54.741 --> 02:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have their own agendas.</v>

3366
02:01:56.691 --> 02:02:01.691
<v Speaker 1>They're beating the crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole history of the world </v>

3367
02:02:01.691 --> 02:02:01.691
<v Speaker 1>going after each other left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about finances.</v>

3368
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that like,</v>

3369
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:07.931
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's gonna be able to keep this </v>

3370
02:02:07.931 --> 02:02:07.931
<v Speaker 1>amazing secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3371
02:02:07.931 --> 02:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You know about the earth is flat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

3372
02:02:08.391 --> 02:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3373
02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives people way more credit than you</v>

3374
02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

3375
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>than they deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to have everybody on the </v>

3376
02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.351
<v Speaker 1>same page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different governments all over </v>

3377
02:02:20.351 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all a lie about like where's the</v>

3378
02:02:21.771 --> 02:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>benefit in lying about the shape of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

3379
02:02:24.110 --> 02:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right down the man was making money.</v>

3380
02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3381
02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:32.381
<v Speaker 1>here's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's really messed up is that </v>

3382
02:02:32.381 --> 02:02:32.381
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3383
02:02:32.381 --> 02:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>climate change denial is just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly less wackadoodle version of </v>

3384
02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:35.390
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3385
02:02:35.391 --> 02:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3386
02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:37.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3387
02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

3388
02:02:38.811 --> 02:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3389
02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I forgot his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morton forgot his first name,</v>

3390
02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>but he talks about climate change being </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hyper object,</v>

3391
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3392
02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>that modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have things that are hyper objects to</v>

3393
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>me just so big that we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a hard time wrapping our minds </v>

3394
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:55.060
<v Speaker 1>around them and that hyper objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3395
02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3396
02:02:56.361 --> 02:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>we're going to evolve new behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the capacity to deal with</v>

3397
02:03:00.411 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 1>hyper objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people want everything to be simple,</v>

3398
02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3399
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 1>which cracks me up because they're fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this being complex,</v>

3400
02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cell phone can be complex because </v>

3401
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 1>I like to use it.</v>

3402
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3403
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 1>the idea that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3404
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:12.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the climate change,</v>

3405
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3406
02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>they need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It freaks them out because it's too </v>

3407
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>complicated or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go for the simple answer,</v>

3408
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.510
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a conspiracy,</v>

3409
02:03:20.511 --> 02:03:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this one.</v>

3410
02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>The scientists are all doing it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money as if my pay was that good that,</v>

3411
02:03:26.331 --> 02:03:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3412
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I think a big issue happened with Al </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gore when Al Gore came out with an </v>

3413
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:35.921
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody connected Al Gore with the </v>

3414
02:03:35.921 --> 02:03:38.771
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a Democrat and then they found out </v>

3415
02:03:38.771 --> 02:03:41.921
<v Speaker 1>that he flies private jets and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker like this is all </v>

3416
02:03:41.921 --> 02:03:43.010
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was enough.</v>

3417
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>There's enough holes where they started </v>
<v Speaker 1>poking through and then looking for </v>

3418
02:03:48.130 --> 02:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies and then looking to deny </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

3419
02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wish,</v>

3420
02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing against Al Gore but.</v>

3421
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>But I wish he hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he didn't become the face of </v>

3422
02:03:58.570 --> 02:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>climate change because it just pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've only,</v>

3423
02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:03.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson or Sagan was still </v>

3424
02:04:03.281 --> 02:04:03.281
<v Speaker 1>alive or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had done it.</v>

3425
02:04:03.281 --> 02:04:07.061
<v Speaker 1>It would've been a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because it wouldn't have happened </v>

3426
02:04:07.061 --> 02:04:07.061
<v Speaker 1>it off of it in an extreme way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3427
02:04:07.061 --> 02:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3428
02:04:07.371 --> 02:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3429
02:04:08.061 --> 02:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3430
02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.420
<v Speaker 1>pull up this article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore may be the first,</v>

3431
02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change billionaire or green </v>

3432
02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.021
<v Speaker 1>billionaire that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's made so much money doing these </v>

3433
02:04:20.021 --> 02:04:23.951
<v Speaker 1>seminars and speeches and the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and they're doing this film,</v>

3434
02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people,</v>

3435
02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't do that well.</v>

3436
02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And then people in the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

3437
02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I saw Al Gore could be the </v>

3438
02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>world's first carbon billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly vice president become the </v>

3439
02:04:37.090 --> 02:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>world's first carbon billionaire after </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing heavily in green energy.</v>

3440
02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That part's okay.</v>

3441
02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Because if he's investing in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and the companies start making</v>

3442
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:45.110
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which like already so sure,</v>

3443
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>solar employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people now than cold does.</v>

3444
02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3445
02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of the dumbest things.</v>

3446
02:04:52.621 --> 02:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when trump became president,</v>

3447
02:04:54.171 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I got to bring back coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how about bring back knocking rocks</v>

3448
02:04:58.201 --> 02:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start fires.</v>

3449
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck man Cole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the typewriter companies got </v>

3450
02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:05.640
<v Speaker 1>together and made sure you never bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer.</v>

3451
02:05:05.641 --> 02:05:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Like we're going to computers illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you got to keep using </v>

3452
02:05:10.641 --> 02:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>typewriters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking terrible anymore.</v>

3453
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3454
02:05:13.111 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

3455
02:05:14.191 --> 02:05:19.191
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that you always got </v>

3456
02:05:19.191 --> 02:05:19.191
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged is that like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3457
02:05:19.191 --> 02:05:20.010
<v Speaker 1>when you change infrastructure is people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to get hurt.</v>

3458
02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:22.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean for those coal miners,</v>

3459

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3468
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:37.250
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3469
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>train them how to put up solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3470
02:05:38.851 --> 02:05:43.851
<v Speaker 1>solar panel.</v>

02:05:43.851 --> 02:05:43.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3474
02:05:43.851 --> 02:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3475
02:05:44.701 --> 02:05:49.701
<v Speaker 1>it's a big thought and consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to automation technology </v>

3476
02:05:50.071 --> 02:05:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the automation thing,</v>

3477
02:05:52.321 --> 02:05:52.890
<v Speaker 1>it's so true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3478
02:05:52.891 --> 02:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about what's been going </v>

3479
02:05:57.891 --> 02:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>on with the last election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3480
02:05:57.891 --> 02:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3481
02:05:57.891 --> 02:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know what's happening with blue</v>

3482
02:05:57.891 --> 02:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>collar people workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is totally true,</v>

3483
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.630
<v Speaker 1>but like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not China,</v>

3484
02:06:03.631 --> 02:06:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it's automation.</v>

3485
02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what really is going to screw</v>

3486
02:06:06.871 --> 02:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>up the whole nature of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3487
02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>for everybody from truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3488
02:06:10.871 --> 02:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>even to meet a university professors is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this,</v>

3489
02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>the Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the automation coming on and </v>

3490
02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>write what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here as a university </v>

3491
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:24.051
<v Speaker 1>professor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is One day going to be retro that kids </v>

3492
02:06:24.051 --> 02:06:27.081
<v Speaker 1>are going to want to learn online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to want to learn through </v>

3493
02:06:27.081 --> 02:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an interactive course so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get on your phone rather </v>

3494
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:31.020
<v Speaker 1>than go to an actual physical place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

3495
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's possible,</v>

3496
02:06:32.221 --> 02:06:37.221
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to be the whole </v>

3497
02:06:37.221 --> 02:06:37.221
<v Speaker 1>question with the new economy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3498
02:06:37.221 --> 02:06:40.581
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we're moving into is finding </v>

3499
02:06:40.581 --> 02:06:40.581
<v Speaker 1>those places where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3500
02:06:40.581 --> 02:06:40.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3501
02:06:40.581 --> 02:06:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right now like,</v>

3502
02:06:41.401 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 1>so when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was like five years ago.</v>

3505
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Once I catch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities are done and everybody's </v>

3506

<v Speaker 1>going to take these online courses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it never happened.</v>

3507
02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:51.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people want to be together.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3515
02:07:02.411 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reviews you get at the end,</v>

3516
02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:05.760
<v Speaker 1>the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3517
02:07:05.761 --> 02:07:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3518
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you should make those tapes for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to sleep because every class your </v>

3519
02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He meant it in a nice way.</v>

3520
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:18.411
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a nice voice that's passive </v>

3521
02:07:18.411 --> 02:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>

3524
02:07:22.230 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people will always,</v>

3525
02:07:23.641 --> 02:07:25.830
<v Speaker 1>with education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be some component of it that,</v>

3526
02:07:25.831 --> 02:07:27.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you can learn it online.</v>

3527
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think like,</v>

3528
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to,</v>

3529
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be,</v>

3530
02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a place for like people </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in and like learning in groups </v>

3531
02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and somebody who has spent their whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life studying the thing,</v>

3532
02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 1>telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3533
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.990
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3534
02:07:40.991 --> 02:07:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of things were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've lost a lot of this.</v>

3535
02:07:43.121 --> 02:07:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mentorship or apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3536
02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:48.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things she needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who knows,</v>

3537
02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who spent their whole life going,</v>

3538
02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:49.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3539
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you crank it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that way because you got to get that</v>

3540
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll never work.</v>

3541
02:07:52.811 --> 02:07:57.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn that from watching a </v>

3542
02:07:57.811 --> 02:07:57.811
<v Speaker 1>video or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3543
02:07:57.811 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A martial arts,</v>

3544
02:07:58.271 --> 02:08:01.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a big part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn from a person can,</v>

3545
02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:04.600
<v Speaker 1>you got to have tiny things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>must show you while you're doing it,</v>

3546
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn a lot of things from </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

3547
02:08:07.390 --> 02:08:08.550
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3548
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting up online,</v>

3549
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>instructional courses and stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>use some of them,</v>

3550
02:08:14.111 --> 02:08:19.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have to fix my sink and we're all </v>

3551
02:08:19.111 --> 02:08:19.111
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3552
02:08:19.111 --> 02:08:19.111
<v Speaker 1>for sure man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:08:19.111 --> 02:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3554
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:20.650
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3555
02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I think like with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll circle back to the UBI.</v>

3556
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3557
02:08:26.261 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 1>like with everything we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to invent new ways.</v>

3558
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>We will because we're just human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a way in which we're going </v>

3559
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3560
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>niche places that there will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies where people make things.</v>

3561
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

3562
02:08:36.071 --> 02:08:41.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean ubi may be necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it may really be necessary </v>

3563
02:08:41.071 --> 02:08:42.910
<v Speaker 1>because if there's no work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3564
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a recipe for disaster for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your democratic society.</v>

3565
02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3566
02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Just hope we can move past this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody who needs that as some </v>

3567
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of a welfare brat.</v>

3568
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3569
02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3570
02:08:55.781 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once there's no work at all,</v>

3571
02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're good because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3572
02:09:00.431 --> 02:09:04.210
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that I like with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>self driving cars.</v>

3573
02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked this question a lot and I've </v>

3574
02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>written about this sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3575
02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:09.240

<v Speaker 1>we got to have self driving cars,</v>

3576
02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:14.011
<v Speaker 1>we're heading toward self driving cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self driving cars will destroy the last </v>

3577
02:09:14.011 --> 02:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>good blue collar job in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3578
02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:15.790
<v Speaker 1>truck driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3579
02:09:15.791 --> 02:09:17.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good livelihood for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people.</v>

3580
02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3581
02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:19.850
<v Speaker 1>we're just gonna eliminate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3582
02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 1>why do we have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3583
02:09:23.201 --> 02:09:23.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3584
02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me there's got to safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake.</v>

3585
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3586
02:09:26.531 --> 02:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>But in total it's not entirely clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3587
02:09:28.901 --> 02:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3588
02:09:30.001 --> 02:09:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that will work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3589
02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the for the,</v>

3590
02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.220
<v Speaker 1>for the lives that are lost in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>

3591
02:09:36.221 --> 02:09:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3592
02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car crashes,</v>

3593
02:09:37.931 --> 02:09:42.931
<v Speaker 1>is that going to be worth the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>upheaval that comes from not having any </v>

3594
02:09:42.931 --> 02:09:42.931
<v Speaker 1>work anymore?</v>

3595
02:09:42.931 --> 02:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>So I mean just like they're these huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>bearing down on us.</v>

3596
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:48.920
<v Speaker 1>If it's your friend or your mom or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved ones.</v>

3597
02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are the kind of calculus.</v>

3598
02:09:50.561 --> 02:09:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3599
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:52.510
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it tears down,</v>

3600
02:09:52.511 --> 02:09:57.511
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if wiping out these jobs destroys </v>

3601
02:09:57.511 --> 02:09:57.511
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3602
02:09:57.511 --> 02:10:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And you end up with really though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem possible.</v>

3603
02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I just think that what it's gonna do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make travel safer and then we have</v>

3604
02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:10.951
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well these jobs that people got from </v>

3605
02:10:10.951 --> 02:10:11.990
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we replace that?</v>

3606
02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>That income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3607
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is we're going to,</v>

3608
02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to start teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to be creative.</v>

3609
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the niche that I think there's </v>

3610
02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>going to be places where like the now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have.</v>

3611
02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>So listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing that we shouldn't have.</v>

3612
02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:24.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not just being,</v>

3613
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you're just looking at all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

3614
02:10:26.041 --> 02:10:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm asking like the CA,</v>

3615
02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving so rapidly into this new </v>

3616
02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3617
02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>That like who's deciding for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's deciding</v>

3618
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.250
<v Speaker 3>that we want cars and we're told that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get it.</v>

3619
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 3>But like a lot of these things I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3620
02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:44.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there needs to be a little bit more </v>

3621
02:10:44.410 --> 02:10:47.590
<v Speaker 3>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy rights and having this stuff </v>

3622
02:10:47.590 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 3>shoved down our throats and told like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best thing ever,</v>

3623
02:10:47.991 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3624
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:50.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about Cell Towers?</v>

3625
02:10:50.421 --> 02:10:55.421
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no getting away from it </v>

3626
02:10:55.421 --> 02:10:55.421
<v Speaker 3>if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3627
02:10:55.421 --> 02:10:57.200
<v Speaker 3>is there a community anywhere that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>made some sort of an agreement?</v>

3628
02:10:57.201 --> 02:10:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Will there be no cell towers in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>community?</v>

3629
02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:04.950
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are communities that have </v>

3630
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.950
<v Speaker 3>decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the southwest that no lights,</v>

3631
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:09.100
<v Speaker 3>no lights at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing because they wanted to </v>

3632
02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 3>preserve their nights guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should really have some sort of a day</v>

3633
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.880
<v Speaker 3>where everybody shuts everything off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees the sky and see how crazy it is </v>

3634
02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:19.751
<v Speaker 3>that we live in this weird state where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on an organic spaceship flying </v>

3635
02:11:19.821 --> 02:11:22.190
<v Speaker 3>through infinity and we don't see that.</v>

3636
02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

3637
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're wanting to do backpacking or </v>

3638
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:27.550
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the back country,</v>

3639
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of days.</v>

3640
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 3>You notice things changing like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mood's not as quite.</v>

3641
02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so nobody looks up now on your right</v>

3642
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:33.620
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing to see because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see anything because the light</v>

3643
02:11:33.621 --> 02:11:38.621
<v Speaker 3>pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the Keck observatory and the </v>

3644
02:11:38.621 --> 02:11:38.621
<v Speaker 3>big island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been?</v>

3645
02:11:38.621 --> 02:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a theorist.</v>

3646
02:11:38.691 --> 02:11:43.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to get me close to a </v>

3647
02:11:43.691 --> 02:11:43.691
<v Speaker 3>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could fucking just.</v>

3648
02:11:43.691 --> 02:11:44.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have to go all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the observatory.</v>

3649
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:45.520
<v Speaker 3>The visitor station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

3650
02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I forget where it's at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 14 or 12 or something like </v>

3651
02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:50.870
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really high.</v>

3652
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's.</v>

3653
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 3>They have diffused lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the big island.</v>

3654
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:58.070
<v Speaker 3>So there's no light pollution and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look up it is just stunning,</v>

3655
02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:58.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3656
02:11:58.490 --> 02:12:01.520
<v Speaker 3>You look up your leg the Milky Way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3657
02:12:01.521 --> 02:12:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And most people have never seen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>milky way right there.</v>

3658
02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you have to have a telescope </v>

3659
02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:10.180
<v Speaker 3>to see out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3660
02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:12.521
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel like you're flying through </v>

3661
02:12:12.521 --> 02:12:15.311
<v Speaker 3>space and you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this really humble feeling that I think </v>

3662
02:12:15.311 --> 02:12:16.190
<v Speaker 3>people get into a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

3663
02:12:16.191 --> 02:12:18.890
<v Speaker 3>People get when they live next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>

3664
02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.110
<v Speaker 3>they get it when they live next to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean,</v>

3665
02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.870
<v Speaker 3>but you really get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could see space,</v>

3666
02:12:23.871 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 3>and I think one of the things that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>haunting the human race is the arrogance</v>

3667
02:12:27.651 --> 02:12:32.651
<v Speaker 3>of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is compounded by the fact that we </v>

3668
02:12:32.651 --> 02:12:33.140
<v Speaker 3>can't see the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we only see what's in front of us,</v>

3669
02:12:33.141 --> 02:12:35.710
<v Speaker 3>so this is the world that we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put a roof over our head.</v>

3670
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:37.940
<v Speaker 3>This is the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got my blinders on.</v>

3671
02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm moving ahead because I want a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>lexus or whatever,</v>

3672
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

3673
02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:43.730
<v Speaker 3>whatever material thing you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>possess when this,</v>

3674
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:48.500
<v Speaker 3>this unstoppable force in front of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look up and you see the cosmos,</v>

3675
02:12:48.501 --> 02:12:52.010
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's an undeniable reality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

3676
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:53.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3677
02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:55.940
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a small thing.</v>

3678
02:12:56.690 --> 02:13:00.380
<v Speaker 3>My existence is just a small thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this mystery,</v>

3679
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:04.400
<v Speaker 3>this giant mystery of what we just found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out 20 years ago.</v>

3680
02:13:04.401 --> 02:13:05.200
<v Speaker 3>There's plant itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3681
02:13:05.201 --> 02:13:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a giant mystery.</v>

3682
02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You're looking up at a hundred billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars in this galaxy alone.</v>

3683
02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>

3684
02:13:11.961 --> 02:13:13.330
<v Speaker 3>You're speaking my language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

3685
02:13:13.410 --> 02:13:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the loss and the myth that the capital m</v>

3686
02:13:16.461 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3687
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:18.500
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an atheist,</v>

3688
02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:23.650
<v Speaker 3>but I believe in mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that that kind of at the core </v>

3689
02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:23.650
<v Speaker 3>of our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3690
02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I wake up everyday to forget here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>

3691
02:13:24.491 --> 02:13:29.491
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be here until I die and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I have no idea what the hell </v>

3692
02:13:29.491 --> 02:13:29.491
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3693
02:13:29.491 --> 02:13:29.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

3694
02:13:29.491 --> 02:13:30.620
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mountain mountains in particular,</v>

3695
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think for mountains,</v>

3696
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:33.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3697
02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>the night sky is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminds you,</v>

3698
02:13:35.731 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it opens that space up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3699
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're sort of like,</v>

3700
02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>

3701
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3702
02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.300
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about it or you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about it,</v>

3703
02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an experience.</v>

3704
02:13:44.171 --> 02:13:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the experience that just shows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>your part of this.</v>

3705
02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It's more than you put your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here and you know,</v>

3706
02:13:51.371 --> 02:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3707
02:13:51.911 --> 02:13:54.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stupidity of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

3708
02:13:54.011 --> 02:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

3709
02:13:54.461 --> 02:13:59.461
<v Speaker 1>the consumer is in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that matters to me is getting my </v>

3710
02:13:59.461 --> 02:13:59.461
<v Speaker 1>next pile of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3711
02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:01.750
<v Speaker 1>when you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize who cares,</v>

3712
02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who freaking cares,</v>

3713
02:14:03.281 --> 02:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3714
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 1>for a moment even you just get the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that mystery and it can be </v>

3715
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 1>transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3716
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happening is we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>created these civilizations as </v>

3717
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:17.011
<v Speaker 2>civilizations need to be lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lights keep us from seeing the </v>

3718
02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:17.080
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe humbles us,</v>

3719
02:14:17.081 --> 02:14:21.280
<v Speaker 2>so we're not humbled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we moved towards acquiring physical</v>

3720
02:14:21.281 --> 02:14:26.281
<v Speaker 2>possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>material objects because we think that </v>

3721
02:14:26.281 --> 02:14:29.341
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make us happy and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire society is geared towards </v>

3722
02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:33.610
<v Speaker 2>innovation because everybody wants the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newest shiny shit that is,</v>

3723
02:14:33.730 --> 02:14:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that is what's leading us to artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and that all this shiny shit is all</v>

3724
02:14:38.681 --> 02:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>innovation and it's eventually going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move to this one singularity.</v>

3725
02:14:42.251 --> 02:14:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And that singularity is some new being.</v>

3726
02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's funny because,</v>

3727
02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing when I think about like all </v>

3728
02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:51.250
<v Speaker 1>these other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3729
02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:51.250
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my argument,</v>

3730
02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>all these other civilizations is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3731
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you make it maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary heritage you get,</v>

3732
02:14:55.791 --> 02:14:57.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we evolved from,</v>

3733
02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both chimpanzees or the chimpanzee </v>

3734
02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>ancestor in the Bonobo ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got like,</v>

3735
02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>we fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hierarchical,</v>

3736
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>very hierarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3737
02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3738
02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:07.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a lot of aggression this,</v>

3739
02:15:07.791 --> 02:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but we also got the vanilla both kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

3740
02:15:09.411 --> 02:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>just have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's cool.</v>

3741
02:15:10.641 --> 02:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sort of,</v>

3742
02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.720
<v Speaker 1>we've got this really weird mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary baggage and whether or not </v>

3743
02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you can make it to the next side with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential challenge of trigger and</v>

3744
02:15:18.831 --> 02:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>climate change is kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your evolution evolution gave you,</v>

3745
02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can imagine species like </v>

3746
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>hive minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3747
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>if you came from termite and intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>termite species,</v>

3748
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:29.840
<v Speaker 1>it might be a lot easier to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change.</v>

3749
02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.380
<v Speaker 1>You're like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3750
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>get on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3751
02:15:32.490 --> 02:15:33.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the,</v>

3752
02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>get on the courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3753
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most essentially is,</v>

3754
02:15:38.261 --> 02:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>can you evolve new behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3755
02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:42.910
<v Speaker 1>So we've been on this track and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading us in a way that,</v>

3756
02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

3757
02:15:43.690 --> 02:15:48.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like the shiny thing dangling in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of us is leading us off on this </v>

3758
02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:48.690
<v Speaker 1>one track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

3759
02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:51.520
<v Speaker 1>can we evolve new behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I actually am going to say this,</v>

3760
02:15:51.521 --> 02:15:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is spiritual,</v>

3761
02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least in my atheist way of </v>

3762
02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:58.200
<v Speaker 1>reconnecting with mystery to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3763
02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of this and we need to </v>

3764
02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:02.821
<v Speaker 1>respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

3765
02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:03.760
<v Speaker 1>when you say spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

3766
02:16:04.150 --> 02:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>So in my first book was about science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion.</v>

3767
02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an atheist,</v>

3768
02:16:07.361 --> 02:16:12.361
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not Richard Dawkins atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that whole idea is the </v>

3769
02:16:12.361 --> 02:16:12.361
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3770
02:16:12.361 --> 02:16:16.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins is what I would call a </v>

3771
02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:16.021
<v Speaker 1>strident atheist and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3772
02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:16.021
<v Speaker 1>anybody who has any spiritual or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3773
02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:18.430
<v Speaker 1>any inclination towards mystery is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

3774
02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she needs to do LSD,</v>

3775
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In sf or Dmt,</v>

3776
02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 2>robin or something that just gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>an experience</v>

3777
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.090
<v Speaker 1>of mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3778
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3779
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.470
<v Speaker 1>so I've been doing zen meditation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last 30 years,</v>

3780
02:16:35.471 --> 02:16:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

3781
02:16:36.191 --> 02:16:41.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've been staring at a wall for 30 </v>

3782
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:41.191
<v Speaker 1>years and the first thing you learn is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really boring.</v>

3783
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the second thing you learned is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their stuff onto your thoughts.</v>

3784
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:43.630
<v Speaker 1>You are not just the shit you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

3785
02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:48.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just sort of settled down and </v>

3786
02:16:48.930 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 1>there's just like this openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3787
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3788
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:51.700
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you said,</v>

3789
02:16:51.701 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the mountains,</v>

3790
02:16:52.451 --> 02:16:57.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love doing back country hiking and </v>

3791
02:16:57.451 --> 02:16:57.451
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get above tree line,</v>

3792
02:16:57.451 --> 02:17:00.671
<v Speaker 1>there's that weird thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're above tree line and just </v>

3793
02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:00.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3794
02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 1>you got this panorama around you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is,</v>

3795
02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

3796
02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:07.090
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which we are part and you know,</v>

3797
02:17:07.390 --> 02:17:12.390
<v Speaker 1>so this is an interesting question about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can virtual reality do this or do </v>

3798
02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you actually need to get out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of think you need to get out there.</v>

3799
02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:15.310
<v Speaker 1>But maybe virtual reality can give </v>
<v Speaker 1>people the impetus to get out there.</v>

3800
02:17:15.630 --> 02:17:16.800
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3801
02:17:16.810 --> 02:17:21.810
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

3802
02:17:21.810 --> 02:17:21.810
<v Speaker 1>with the virtual reality experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the mountains.</v>

3803
02:17:21.810 --> 02:17:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd probably be pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

3804
02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

3805
02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Something about being in the mountains </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also,</v>

3806
02:17:27.071 --> 02:17:29.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird feeling,</v>

3807
02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a weird feeling that there's</v>

3808
02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.140
<v Speaker 1>no signal out there in the places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cell signal.</v>

3809
02:17:35.141 --> 02:17:40.141
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a feeling you get when you are </v>

3810
02:17:40.141 --> 02:17:40.141
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3811
02:17:40.141 --> 02:17:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you see wildlife and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife out there.</v>

3812
02:17:43.271 --> 02:17:45.430
<v Speaker 1>They're almost like these mystical </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

3813
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>like when you see a deer step out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree line and it's like Hashtag.</v>

3814
02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing has been that way for a </v>

3815
02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

3816
02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:57.550
<v Speaker 1>That's that species has not changed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in a million years.</v>

3817
02:17:57.850 --> 02:17:59.500
<v Speaker 1>And the signal what you talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal lights,</v>

3818
02:17:59.501 --> 02:18:04.501
<v Speaker 1>it's really the thing is what for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when I get far enough back </v>

3819
02:18:04.501 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that I know that there's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>another human being,</v>

3820
02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just like when I leave this exact,</v>

3821
02:18:08.171 --> 02:18:13.171
<v Speaker 1>it's going to still be happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's doesn't give a shit about you </v>

3822
02:18:13.171 --> 02:18:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's just moving along and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3823
02:18:13.751 --> 02:18:16.930
<v Speaker 1>it's been moving this way for millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years and you just realized like.</v>

3824
02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3825
02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:19.540
<v Speaker 1>part of the thing I'm saying with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book is that like,</v>

3826
02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we trigger climate change,</v>

3827
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that's just the earth way of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the next set,</v>

3828
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used us to create climate change to,</v>

3829
02:18:27.590 --> 02:18:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now move onto something else because </v>

3830
02:18:32.590 --> 02:18:32.590
<v Speaker 1>that's what the earth does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this animal power,</v>

3831
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're out there you feel that,</v>

3832
02:18:34.811 --> 02:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3833
02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.090
<v Speaker 1>on the thing that I think we need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of,</v>

3834
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:42.180
<v Speaker 1>we established our connection to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were part of that were from that we're </v>

3835
02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.450
<v Speaker 1>not evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not bad.</v>

3836
02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.020
<v Speaker 1>We need to reintegrate ourselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we still get our civilization.</v>

3837
02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:48.580
<v Speaker 1>But you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

3838
02:18:48.610 --> 02:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>So you ask why spiritual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when we connect to that mystery,</v>

3839
02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:58.140
<v Speaker 1>then we're in a better place to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right decisions to understand what the </v>

3840
02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:58.140
<v Speaker 1>decisions are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

3841
02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:58.140
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3842
02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:59.800
<v Speaker 1>we've got to save the polar bears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not looking at.</v>

3843
02:18:59.801 --> 02:19:00.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3844
02:19:00.161 --> 02:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the biosphere as a whole that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand well,</v>

3845
02:19:03.411 --> 02:19:08.411
<v Speaker 1>operating out of ego and ideology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of rational thought with all the</v>

3846
02:19:08.771 --> 02:19:13.771
<v Speaker 1>information at our disposal and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>verifying that information for </v>

3847
02:19:13.771 --> 02:19:16.941
<v Speaker 1>understanding what's correct and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not correct and whether or not there's </v>

3848
02:19:16.941 --> 02:19:20.010
<v Speaker 1>bias behind it or scientific research </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was funded by people that have a </v>

3849
02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 1>vested interest in it leaning one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

3850
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is very,</v>

3851
02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:24.880
<v Speaker 1>very slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous,</v>

3852
02:19:24.881 --> 02:19:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and when you find out that studies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been influenced,</v>

3853
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>special</v>

3854
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.280
<v Speaker 3>interest groups or lobbyists or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they,</v>

3855
02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:36.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like especially pharmaceutical studies </v>

3856
02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 3>of the creepiest where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do a series of studies and only</v>

3857
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:42.941
<v Speaker 3>one of them show some sort of a positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact for whatever weird reason and </v>

3858
02:19:42.941 --> 02:19:44.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the one they use and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to publish the fact that they ran a</v>

3859
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:46.010
<v Speaker 3>hundred fucking studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3860
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try and teach people.</v>

3861
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

3862
02:19:47.890 --> 02:19:48.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3863
02:19:48.210 --> 02:19:48.630
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3864
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I think the most important thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people need to understand about science,</v>

3865
02:19:52.401 --> 02:19:55.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much sciences results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how science works,</v>

3866
02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it does work,</v>

3867
02:19:56.841 --> 02:20:01.841
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we have all this stuff and </v>

3868
02:20:01.841 --> 02:20:01.841
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can distinguish.</v>

3869
02:20:01.841 --> 02:20:01.841
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3870
02:20:01.841 --> 02:20:06.221
<v Speaker 3>I say that science is three things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spitballs supertankers and </v>

3871
02:20:06.221 --> 02:20:06.221
<v Speaker 3>stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3872
02:20:06.221 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the news,</v>

3873
02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:09.710
<v Speaker 3>there'll be like the latest study shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>the color red,</v>

3874
02:20:09.711 --> 02:20:11.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will make you have better sex.</v>

3875
02:20:11.310 --> 02:20:12.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3876
02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:17.720
<v Speaker 3>then it lets the latest study that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get you to click on that USA today or </v>

3877
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:20.240
<v Speaker 3>the media reports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as if this was science,</v>

3878
02:20:20.241 --> 02:20:22.400
<v Speaker 3>like every day a whole bunch of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles come out.</v>

3879
02:20:22.430 --> 02:20:23.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write scientific articles,</v>

3880
02:20:23.811 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 3>that's the currency of my profession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like one study is,</v>

3881
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:29.360
<v Speaker 3>is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a spitball,</v>

3882
02:20:29.390 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like basically we're shooting </v>

3883
02:20:34.390 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 3>spitballs at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but science is like a super tanker,</v>

3884
02:20:34.390 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3885
02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.480
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes seven miles to turn a super </v>

3886
02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:39.480
<v Speaker 3>tanker around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what really science is the things</v>

3887
02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:44.081
<v Speaker 3>that we think we deeply understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science is like the super tanker and </v>

3888
02:20:44.081 --> 02:20:47.291
<v Speaker 3>people are shooting spitballs at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>papers every day and if you get enough </v>

3889
02:20:47.291 --> 02:20:48.260
<v Speaker 3>spit balls on one side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3890
02:20:48.261 --> 02:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the prow or whatever it starts to turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>it right.</v>

3891
02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 3>So the science will turn slowly if </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough of the spit balls are lined up.</v>

3892
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:56.270
<v Speaker 3>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3893
02:20:56.271 --> 02:21:01.271
<v Speaker 3>it's not about the single study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about have there been 300 studies </v>

3894
02:21:01.271 --> 02:21:03.290
<v Speaker 3>over the last 30 years that say the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

3895
02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:03.760
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3896
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:04.910
<v Speaker 3>the coffee stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee's good.</v>

3897
02:21:04.911 --> 02:21:09.911
<v Speaker 3>Coffee's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly the fact that we keep getting </v>

3898
02:21:09.911 --> 02:21:09.911
<v Speaker 3>both answers means we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we don't know yet.</v>

3899
02:21:09.911 --> 02:21:12.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climate change 30.</v>

3900
02:21:12.141 --> 02:21:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Not even 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hundred years of the same results.</v>

3901
02:21:14.810 --> 02:21:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got that.</v>

3902
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:21.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's always a problem with diet </v>

3903
02:21:21.010 --> 02:21:23.141
<v Speaker 3>in that you're not taking into account </v>
<v Speaker 3>how nutrients interact with other foods </v>

3904
02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.920
<v Speaker 3>or different foods interact with foods </v>
<v Speaker 3>and different.</v>

3905
02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:26.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3906
02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:27.770
<v Speaker 3>when you say coffee's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3907
02:21:27.771 --> 02:21:32.771
<v Speaker 3>Was it bad when you're smoking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes are bad when you're eating </v>

3908
02:21:32.771 --> 02:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>grass fed meat or bad when you're on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan diet or when is it bad?</v>

3909
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3910
02:21:34.671 --> 02:21:39.671
<v Speaker 3>Who are these people and what are they </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting in their system and how much </v>

3911
02:21:39.671 --> 02:21:39.671
<v Speaker 3>sugar are they taking in and how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>sodium and you know,</v>

3912
02:21:39.671 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the nutrient levels,</v>

3913
02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:41.810
<v Speaker 3>their blood.</v>

3914
02:21:41.810 --> 02:21:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Did you test them for b12 deficiencies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different things.</v>

3915
02:21:45.121 --> 02:21:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the real problem with any </v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary studies.</v>

3916
02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:53.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely varied diet of and the </v>

3917
