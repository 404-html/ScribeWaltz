<v Speaker 1>You'll never be the hardest working guy.</v>

149
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be the most confident cause it's like that's your only in like you got</v>

150
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>no other value added thing broke you off.</v>

151
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

152
00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:08.840
<v Speaker 1>he just was honest.</v>

153
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.471
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

154
00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:10.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be rich.</v>

156
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be rich.</v>

157
00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:13.490
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be,</v>

158
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.023
<v Speaker 1>here's a rule.</v>

160
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>You ain't got a big dig.</v>

161
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

162
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>And my dad got it mad,</v>

163
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>mad women.</v>

164
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got,</v>

165
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and he was so ugly,</v>

166
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but he just loved him.</v>

167
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>He knew how to,</v>

168
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.801
<v Speaker 1>he talked.</v>

169
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Honest,</v>

170
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>he talked on us and he treated them like he treated with respect and as a woman.</v>

171
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I learned a lot from him.</v>

172
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>But when my dad died,</v>

173
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to this little place called comfort zone camp.</v>

174
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a camp for kids that have lost their dads.</v>

175
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I was,</v>

176
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>we helped to build the La camp and my wife and I did my eye,</v>

178
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.783
<v Speaker 1>but I met her there.</v>

179
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

180
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but we helped build these camps for these kids at all.</v>

181
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Their dads had buy a diet and drive bys.</v>

182
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>So you meet all these 12 year old kids that are going in,</v>

183
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you know they're getting recruited by gangs already cause their dads have</v>

184
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:50.491
<v Speaker 1>already there.</v>

185
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>There are 23 year old dads,</v>

186
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>had been killed 25 zero we did.</v>

188
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.271
<v Speaker 1>So we learn,</v>

189
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>

190
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>grief was a huge part early on and so for me,</v>

191
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>like when I got Adam,</v>

192
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I really rock bottom and I realize it's time to get going where I figured that</v>

193
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

194
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the doing good versus doing bad was at this camp.</v>

195
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

196
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I got addicted to that camp.</v>

197
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I volunteered every single weekend and I would just make it go away for three</v>

198
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>nights and hanging out these kids and that's when I got my new addiction was</v>

199
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>then wow.</v>

200
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It changed my life.</v>

201
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That place changed when I met my wife there.</v>

202
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I came up with new business,</v>

203
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>my business clutter cleaner.</v>

204
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.761
<v Speaker 1>I came up with it.</v>

205
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>They're helping these kids.</v>

206
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I met a lot of great women and met my wife there.</v>

207
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I wouldn't have what I have.</v>

208
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 1>How did you pull yourself out of the gambling spar?</v>

209
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>You said you found you.</v>

210
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>So I ran like a fucking chicken man.</v>

211
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

212
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:36.351
<v Speaker 1>I got my ass kicked by a bookie and I owed 40 grand the night before I had $10</v>

213
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:38.674
<v Speaker 1>left to my name.</v>

214
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I knew I owed this bookie when it was,</v>

215
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it was 40 grand and it was a lot.</v>

216
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I knew I only had $10 in my pocket and my girlfriend was waiting for me.</v>

217
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I was in Lake Tahoe.</v>

218
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>She was waiting for me at the top of the hill up in heaven.</v>

219
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Lee and I was gambling all night.</v>

220
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't hide Tendai what,</v>

221
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>$5 in my mind I thought I had $5 at the end of the night and I was like,</v>

222
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:58.301
<v Speaker 1>I better put this down.</v>

223
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a cab ride home.</v>

224
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:04.381
<v Speaker 1>So I was giving up at $5 to my name and I owed 42 the booking.</v>

225
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Which for a 24 year old kid and make it not making that as a lot of money.</v>

227
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I put the chip down.</v>

228
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.543
<v Speaker 1>Lost,</v>

229
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>came out.</v>

230
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.051
<v Speaker 1>I had no,</v>

231
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:14.471
<v Speaker 1>my last,</v>

232
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>my last dollar came out and had nothing and it was like I got a fucking problem.</v>

233
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And so I was looking at the cabby and he's like the guy that drove me back every</v>

234
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>night and he was like,</v>

235
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>he looked at me and was like,</v>

236
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:26.441
<v Speaker 1>I got no money man.</v>

237
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>So I started walking up hill five miles uphill to the ski resort.</v>

238
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Tom's a very uh,</v>

239
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>awesome isolating place.</v>

240
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was a five mile,</v>

241
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>it's inclined roads.</v>

242
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>We went up and I'm walking up this thing and he came and picked me up and he was</v>

243
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.221
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

244
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:39.461
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

245
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

246
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>you got to get your life together man.</v>

247
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>You've got gotta quit gambling and everyone is,</v>

248
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>and at that point I was still judging people and I was like looking at this,</v>

249
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.941
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

250
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:50.210
<v Speaker 1>this poor stupid cab driver knew God knows what happened to him,</v>

251
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>but I was totally judging him yet he's saving me,</v>

252
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>he's picking me up.</v>

253
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm still treating this guy like in my mind like a piece of shit.</v>

254
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.491
<v Speaker 1>And he picks me up.</v>

255
00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.271
<v Speaker 1>He dropped me off and I'm like,</v>

256
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>can I give you anything?</v>

257
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Can I,</v>

258
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.910
<v Speaker 1>can I it?</v>

259
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.221
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

260
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

261
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>just stop gambling.</v>

262
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me like,</v>

263
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>just fucking stop.</v>

264
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That's when they just off.</v>

265
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and I called my mom the next morning and she was like,</v>

267
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.044
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>

268
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So then I went,</v>

269
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I called the bookie and I was like,</v>

270
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do man.</v>

271
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the money.</v>

272
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

273
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.671
<v Speaker 1>this was like a movie.</v>

274
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

275
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>no worries man.</v>

276
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gonna be fine.</v>

277
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.583
<v Speaker 1>We'll work it out.</v>

278
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.633
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>

279
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.181
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

280
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I might be able to scrounge up $1,000.</v>

281
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

282
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

283
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.771

285
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.091
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

286
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>this isn't like movies at all.</v>

287
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:27.501
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>

288
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:27.711

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean my kids are just wearing me out and I don't really have the effort for</v>

379
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff anymore.</v>

380
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.770

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:01.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383

384
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Like I had it this year.</v>

385
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I had a really bad itch and I had a flight to Vegas to do a hoarder's episode</v>

386
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't even in Vegas.</v>

387
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I just had a three hour layover and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going downtown.</v>

390
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And I got excited and I hadn't had that itch in a long time.</v>

391
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I can drink,</v>

392
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:16.151
<v Speaker 1>I can smoke,</v>

393
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I can do whatever because I can walk,</v>

394
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:18.244
<v Speaker 1>go away.</v>

395
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't walk away from a table.</v>

396
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.753
<v Speaker 1>That's my weakness.</v>

397
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to walk away if I have a dollar or 10 grand fucking blow your</v>

398
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>special brain chemistry,</v>

00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:29.164
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is in Europe.</v>

400
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.771

404
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than you.</v>

405
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>

406
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And I know it's,</v>

407
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.893
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

408
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 1>it's the self worth thing.</v>

409
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for self worth.</v>

410
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.521
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

411
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.530
<v Speaker 1>but how do you get so forth that it began for me?</v>

412
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:45.131
<v Speaker 1>That's where it went,</v>

413
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

414

00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean for you you might get,</v>

416
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:46.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

417
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 1>where do you get yourself worth?</v>

418
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't Dunno.</v>

419
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.061
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

420
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Try not to think about it.</v>

421
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:49.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

422
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>my new thing now it's like I really know that I'm making a difference on these</v>

423
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:53.704
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

424
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.431
<v Speaker 1>so I dig that.</v>

425
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to get it.</v>

426
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm getting my rough go.</v>

427
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Five decisions away,</v>

428
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>five decisions of where and when and what is essentially,</v>

429
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>what does it well,</v>

430
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.501
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

431
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it just recounts all my mistakes.</v>

432
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Over the last 15 years I was doing a hoarder's where in New York City where this</v>

433
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.450
<v Speaker 1>guy had a mass,</v>

434
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>he had an acre in Brooklyn,</v>

435
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>a massive property in Brooklyn.</v>

436
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>This guy inherited it from his dad and it was,</v>

437
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>had about six feet of bicycles all the way through the yard.</v>

438
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>So an acre at six feet high.</v>

439
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.481
<v Speaker 1>Think of the metal,</v>

440
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the value of that metal was probably a hundred grand and metal and he had a bum</v>

441
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>living in his yard.</v>

442
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So inside the hoard,</v>

443
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a bum living there and that was one of the things we had to clean up.</v>

444
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>We have to get rid of the bum.</v>

445
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So I was literally,</v>

446
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was two years ago,</v>

447
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:32.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here in,</v>

448
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

449
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.210
<v Speaker 1>in Brooklyn hanging out with this bum.</v>

450
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.881
<v Speaker 1>His name is Gregory.</v>

451
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:36.714
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget him.</v>

452
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.561
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

453
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is the cool thing about hoarders.</v>

454
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I get to meet Delis dudes.</v>

455
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.471
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

456
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:40.841
<v Speaker 1>all right Greg,</v>

457
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>

458
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.761
<v Speaker 1>you end up here man.</v>

459
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Cause he had,</v>

460
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:42.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

461
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of,</v>

462
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>like a 40 ounces,</v>

463
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.253
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of,</v>

464
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of these magnum condoms.</v>

465
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:48.624
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

466
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.321
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

467
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>this guy's getting more acid than I am.</v>

468
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And he lives in a chicken shack.</v>

469
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.083
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

470
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.061
<v Speaker 1>he was huffing.</v>

471
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was hot.</v>

472
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>He was just huffing gasoline,</v>

473
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.230
<v Speaker 1>huffing gasoline.</v>

474
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Condoms.</v>

476
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

477
00:09:58.171 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 1>They would fill up the condoms and then,</v>

478
00:09:59.600 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

479
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>with the fumes and thought he was getting asked.</v>

480
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really just trying to get high.</v>

481
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>She kicked me in the nuts.</v>

482
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>A job that must keep you grounded in,</v>

483
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>in like other possibilities of reality,</v>

484
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily your reality,</v>

485
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>but the pony was ever in this.</v>

486
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.361
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

487
00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>that's what we came with five decisions away because,</v>

488
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:17.671
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

489
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>back to it,</v>

490
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>we need finished it,</v>

491
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>that bum sitting in the yard.</v>

492
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I asked him how he got there and he goes,</v>

493
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:22.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

494
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I was a stockbroker.</v>

495
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.211
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

496
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.010
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>

497
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

498
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.981
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

499
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:26.311
<v Speaker 1>he's there,</v>

500
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>he's full of shit or this is real.</v>

501
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So I went with it,</v>

502
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

503
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.161
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

504
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you were striking?</v>

505
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

506
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I was a stockbroker and a girl broke my heart and they go,</v>

507
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me you're living in this guy's yard because a girl broke your</v>

508
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

509
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 1>He was willing got addicted to crack too.</v>

510
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>But the girl broke my heart and I was like,</v>

511
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:42.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

512
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:42.751
<v Speaker 1>the crack plan.</v>

513
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Have something to do with it.</v>

514
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 1>But he lived in a fucking shack.</v>

516
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And so I looked at the camera and I go,</v>

517
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess we are all really s five decisions away from shitting in a bucket.</v>

518
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

520
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And that just stuck.</v>

521
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And when I said that people ran with it,</v>

522
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm clearly five,</v>

523
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>had many five decisions away from shitting in a bucket.</v>

524
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

525
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>couple things different happened and I in my life could've been totally</v>

526
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

527
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It might not be any five,</v>

528
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>it could be one if it's a bad one.</v>

529
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
