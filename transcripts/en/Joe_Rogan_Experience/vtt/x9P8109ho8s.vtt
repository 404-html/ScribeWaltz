1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.460
No
Bush,
Yo,

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.383
peace man.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.723
<v 1>No,</v>

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.620
<v 0>Hey fuckers,
put your pants.
But my pants were on.</v>

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.450
I found the name of the guy who does those fucking kettlebells.

6
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:21.980
Finally,
Jesus Christ that was driving me nuts.
So the Ani Kettlebells,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.620
kettlebells,
kettle bells are made by Steven Shubin,
Steven Shubin,

8
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:32.330
who is actually Aubrey stepbrother and he's got a shop out in New Mexico where

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.010
they make the Onnit kettle bells,

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.480
the primal bell's a that you've seen with the awesome Carrillo face.
The new one,

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.200
uh,
rang a Tang,
which a $5 of everyone,

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.910
the proceeds go to help save orangutans.

13
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.960
They're in endangered species.
Um,

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.350
and then of course the chimpanzee,
which is 35 pounds,

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.620
I think probably they're all in dangerous,
right?
I mean,
and one way or another.

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130
I mean,
they're only alive because we,

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.560
we make sure that people don't kill too many of them.

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.240
They have a real problem with it.
In Africa.

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.560
They call it bushmeat and they kill chimpanzees.
I was like,
reading this,
uh,

20
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.280
this piece on,
on bushmeat various monkeys of the kill and eat.

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.130
They just fucking eat everything they catch and they don't,

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:14.000
they don't give a shit.

23
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.140
I guess in certain parts of Africa I should probably be specific.

24
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.760
But in certain parts of Africa,

25
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:23.240
they don't give a shit apparently about what's legal or illegal.

26
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.640
Um,
anyway,
that's neither here nor there.
These are not real monkeys,

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.850
but they look bad ass and the help your fitness,
they're uh,

28
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.810
if you've never worked out with kettle bells,
um,
we have,
uh,
a workout video,

29
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:40.250
two of them,
the extreme kettlebell cardio,
a DVD by Keith Weber one and two.

30
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.520
Um,
but I always suggest and it gets repetitive,

31
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:47.180
but unfortunately I can't be assured that you've listened to every one of these.

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.730
Um,
so if you,
uh,

33
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:52.490
are thinking about doing any kind of workout routine with weights at least once

34
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:53.930
or twice,
go to a trainer,

35
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.720
go to a trainer and have someone teach you how to do the moves correctly.

36
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.390
Start with low weights.
Work your way up.
Trust me.

37
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.980
It's a weird way of working out kettlebells and club bells and things along

38
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.580
those lines.
They're,
they're really awkward.
They put a lot of,
uh,

39
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.610
strange strain on your body that you might not be used to and it requires a good

40
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:17.270
form for all of those activities.
You don't want to get injured,
injury suck,

41
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:21.800
especially ones that you could have avoided if you did it.
Smart.
Trust me,

42
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.730
I've done that.
Have injured myself like an idiot.
It's a terrible feeling.

43
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.990
You just feel stupid and you know,
hopefully you learn,
but better.

44
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.040
Learn from other people,

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.700
learn from other people and just be really diligent about it.
There's plenty of,

46
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:39.090
uh,
videos,
uh,
on,
on itself.
You can see there's one here with a,

47
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.740
our pal Aubrey,
where he's going to teach some of the basics of kettlebells.

48
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.840
And if you know how he's doing it,
he's doing it with a very light kettlebell.

49
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.860
That's a 35 pounder.
You don't want to get crazy.
Trust me.

50
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.520
You can get a really good workout in with a,
a fairly light cut kettlebell.

51
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
There's one that I do the k,
the Kettlebell cardio extreme workout.

52
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.980
I do that fucking thing with for 35 pound Kettlebell e a manly man

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.490
<v 2>like myself.
Joe Is ovary wearing those feces.
Yes,</v>

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.260
these are awesome girls wearing the feces and the guy,

55
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.950
the worst defeat sees what you don't work for you.
Are you serious?
Absolutely.

56
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.180
You've got some ugg boots too.

57
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.720
Don't you know I love boots cause there you're supposed to work out barefoot.

58
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.010
Steve Maxwell,
famed fitness trainer told me that,
uh,

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.410
the real way to use your,

60
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:27.610
your feet and keep your feet strong and like activate all your muscles is you're

61
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.980
supposed to be barefoot.
That's how you're supposed to run.

62
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.360
It's how are you supposed to do everything?

63
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.340
And that's why there's a move to a minimalist running shoe and running on the

64
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.620
ball of the foot.
Now instead of the heel,

65
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.710
when they created these running shoes,

66
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:45.640
he's really cool running shoes with the springs in the back of them they changed

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.700
a human's gate because most people's running gait is not heal first.

68
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.650
It's actually like if you watch like little kids run,

69
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.120
they run and sort of cushion the impact with the ball of their foot and their

70
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.020
foot acts as a shock absorber.
If you're just running,
he'll first,

71
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.800
you're not getting that shock absorber you just slamming down,
uh,

72
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.780
on your heel into the ground.

73
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.781
And the way that was made possible is because of those fat sold running shoes.

74
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.430
And they actually changed the way people run.

75
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.560
You really supposed to run on those things.

76
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.290
He's supposed to run the ball your foot first.
And that's what,

77
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.190
and if you did that,

78
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.560
then another thing would happen is you wouldn't want to run on concrete.

79
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.120
He would realize it.
You'd be like,
Ooh,
this is like,
this is stupid.

80
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.450
Like this doesn't exist in nature.
You know?
Dirts okay,

81
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.920
you can run on a nice dirt road and it's okay,
but running on concrete,
it's like,

82
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.010
boy,
I mean you can do it,
but after a while it's going to,

83
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:42.820
you're paying a toll and unnecessary told him my opinion,

84
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.380
you're not wearing these like out.

85
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.310
They all garden zero fucks to give zero fucks on.

86
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.450
Have you ever worn those footsies with your,
uh,
Pennypack I'm sure I have.

87
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.220
Absolutely.
It's at the gym.
Yeah.

88
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.850
At the same time and making it a lot of grunts and sexual noises.

89
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.000
While I'm lifting weights.
That's rare.
Like bigfoot.
I give no,
no,
no.

90
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:06.640
It's very common.
Well,
it's common.
You'll find it.

91
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.780
You'll find it anywhere where there's a men who don't give a fuck and know what

92
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:13.660
the correct footwear is.
If they tell you you have to wear shoes at the gym,

93
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.240
you're really supposed to wear those things,
those little footie things.

94
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.800
I liked the Filo.
One's a fairly nice,
have you been worried?

95
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.600
Have you worn the fanny pack feet seats with the,
the chain wallet?
No.

96
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.790
All right.
That would be,

97
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.100
that'd be the Loch ness monster real?
Yeah.

98
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.940
Well the chain wall was in the fanny pack.
I mean,
uh,
no.

99
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.970
I put it in there so I don't have to like from at the gym,

100
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.030
I could put everything in the bag.
If I'm traveling,
I put everything in the bag,

101
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.460
the fanny pack.
What?
It's really good for us airports.

102
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.850
You put everything in your bag,
boom.
It goes through the radar detector.

103
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.050
He put it back on.
Right.
It's way easier than dumping your keys out in trays.

104
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.630
It's easy to get things and you sit on the plane.

105
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.200
You looking for your iPhone dunes right there.
You pull it up.
See Science.

106
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.220
It's just looks goofy.
That's what you just can't be afraid of looking goofy.

107
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.990
I put a picture on my Instagram the other day,

108
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.230
this old man up I probably shouldn't have.
I didn't ask this promotion that.

109
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.030
Did he say anything to you?
Because he looked like he was looking right at,

110
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.490
you know,
taking a photo.

111
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.760
But it was rocking and hard and I had to give him his props.

112
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.470
He probably thought I was making fun of them,

113
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.780
but in reality I was giving them prompts.

114
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.190
If I didn't actually wear a fanny pack myself,
I would feel bad.
But I did it.

115
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.630
<v 3>But I don't see,
I think we should go the opposite.
I think we like,</v>

116
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.250
we need to bring back like the pockets in the shoes but make them bigger so you

117
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.650
could put your cell phones in there,
like make bigger shoes in the shoes.

118
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.470
I remember those.
What are those Kangaroos?

119
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.500
<v 2>Oh,
I don't remember those at all.
I do.
Now that you brought it up,</v>

120
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.330
they would like the tongue had like a zipper in or some crazy.

121
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.810
What a dumb idea.
So in front of me.
A lot of money on that though.

122
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.700
People who wear that shit for a while

123
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.240
<v 3>still make those shoes.
I see.
They still make these,
well this is a toddler one.</v>

124
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.000
If you're betting on futures.
I put some money in fanny packs.

125
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.960
I think that bitch is coming back.
Oh,
those are Kangaroos on the sides.

126
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.880
You put your key.
Yeah,
but what if they make them bigger?
So it's like,

127
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.840
like you're wearing boots again,
kind of cowboy boots,

128
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:10.470
but they're just more like a man purse and your shoe place to put things.

129
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.470
So it'd be rattling around up against your leg.

130
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.420
<v 2>The correct place is the fanny pack.</v>

131
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.450
That's what a lot of people don't want to admit.
It's the right way to do it.

132
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.790
It's the easiest way to get to.
It's all right here.

133
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.320
Don't have to reach around and not wearing a fucking satchel pretending it's on

134
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:29.060
a purse.
It's a Satchel.
It's a Satchel.
I like.

135
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.420
I'm a man of the city and I wear a Satchel.

136
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.120
I get off my 10 speed bike.

137
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.260
I have my lock with my Satchel.

138
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.920
Yeah,
satchels.
Nice.
Is nothing wrong with it.
We've,

139
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.130
we've done this ramp before cause nothing wrong with it.

140
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.160
It's nothing wrong with a Satchel or a purse.
You want to wear a purse?

141
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.870
Who gives a fuck?
If you give a shit,

142
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.710
if a guy's wearing a leather bag covered in rhinestones,
you're an asshole.
Yeah.

143
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.580
But sometimes it looks really great.
Like that's just a person.

144
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.840
It's a burst no matter what.
But because it's flat,
it's okay.

145
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.980
We are so stupid.
People are so stupid.
At Hertz,

146
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.240
we're so dumb that we give a fuck about the shape of the bag that you carry in

147
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.610
your shoulder and whether or not it makes you feminine.

148
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.680
That's how fucking stupid we are.
If it,
if it's flat,
it's a laptop.

149
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.360
But if it's rounded,
Eh,

150
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:25.060
you a PA Uva prayer.
Faith.

151
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.700
What's in the bag,
buddy?
It's a laptop.

152
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.940
Oh well you're allowed to carry it like that.
If it was just makeup and shit,

153
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.590
what's in the bag?
Oh,
just penises.

154
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.690
Various penises have collected throughout the day.
I'm a penis hunter.

155
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.590
Yeah.
What do you carrying in there?
If you Karen rocks,
nobody can say shit.

156
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.380
If you got like a fucking canvas Satchel filled with rocks and one's going to

157
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.480
call it a purse,
right?

158
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.550
But you also carry your sandwich in there and your keys with the rocks sandwich

159
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.800
gets all fucked up though in men or hey,
slice it Jesus Christ and,

160
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.700
and what we're talking about,

161
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.100
you started off talking about supplements on a.com o.N ,N ,
I t,

162
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.300
use a code name Brogan.

163
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.540
Save yourself 10% off any and all supplements if you haven't been there before.

164
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:15.090
We got a lot of cool new shit in there.
So go check it out.

165
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.950
Go to [inaudible] dot com get up on it.

166
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.910
We're also brought to you by stamps.com yeah,
just because I said get up on it.

167
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.500
That made the commercial 15% more douche on it.
It at least,

168
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.330
at least it's if,
if we had like a song,

169
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.540
get up on end

170
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.840
up on it and grab it like you want it whenever you promoting anything.

171
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.290
There's an air of gross and it's to it.
Even if what you're selling is awesome,

172
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.490
just comes out grows.

173
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
It just seems gross so there's no way to do commercials that aren't a little

174
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:51.900
gross,
but people have to realize that it doesn't mean the product isn't good.

175
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.020
Like stamps.com we've said it many,
many times before.

176
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:56.820
It's way easier than going to the post office.

177
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.000
One of the reasons why they were one of our sponsors is because it makes sense.

178
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.790
It's,
it's a great product.
If you run your own business,

179
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.800
if you have your own business,
you can go to your home computer,

180
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.260
you weigh your shit out on a scale that they provide.

181
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.920
You print up the postals thing,
the postman comes,

182
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.530
you put it on the packages and you're off to the races.

183
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.870
You don't have to go anywhere and I'm waiting in line.

184
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.420
All that ridiculous silly bullshit.

185
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.370
Mailing and shipping can be a very challenging thing if you're making constant

186
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:27.540
trips to the post office.

187
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.540
But stamps.com can just sorta do everything the postdocs can do right inside

188
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.930
your house.
And if you go to stamps.com before you do anything else,

189
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:39.750
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage.

190
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.490
This one of those old schooly microphones that if you're a classy comedian,

191
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:48.810
you will use and your headshot
and use the code word j,

192
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.920
r e and uh,
you will save yourself some money with,

193
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:56.490
they're $110 bonus offer.
It includes a digital scale,

194
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.250
enough to $55 in free postage.

195
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.020
I'm Brian needs to stamps.com for all those t shirts,
all the death squads,

196
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:06.420
teachers that you've seen from a desk,
squad.tv.

197
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.440
All those are sent from stamps.com it's literally that easy.

198
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.500
Can you believe it is literally that easy?

199
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.460
I hate people that use literally and then I'm using it.
Speech folks,

200
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:21.870
even though it can be annoying,
is oftentimes just sort of automatic.
Okay?

201
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:24.600
It's not indicative of you being an asshole if you use literally,

202
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.740
but sometimes someone has to tell you,
hey,
fuck,

203
00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:30.330
head stopped saying literally after everything,
you're killing my brain.

204
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.190
Nothing wrong with that.
Either.

205
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.140
stamps.com code word jre and seen this weekend.

206
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.230

207
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.360

208
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.050
<v 3>and with Tony a the 26 in Phoenix,
Arizona.
Bad.

Ohio at Thompson,

210
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.320
Christina Palicki

211
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 2>and Tony.
Oh,
good googly Mowgli son.
And a crazy show.</v>

212
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.740
It's a Goddamn road trip.
Those are good road trips right there that stand up.

213
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:07.600
Lives at Groin Club,
man.
Holy Shit.
That place is awesome.
It's so huge.

214
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.010
It's kind of a daunting size.
It's awesome though.

215
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.500
So cool that there's,
you know,
we're so lucky.

216
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.990
There's so many cool clubs like that that are out there.

217
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.820
There's one of the beautiful things about being a standup.

218
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.130
You can travel and totally spots,
do all these different cool ass clubs.

219
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.690
Anyway.
Um,
that's it.
That's where we be.
Your fucks.

220
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.540
I'm also,
uh,
in Toronto.
Um,
on,
uh,

221
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.470
I think the 19th,
I can't say my desktop.
Yeah,

222
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.270
the night the 19th.

223
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.830
I'm in Toronto with Brian Cowen and Tommy Segora.
Oh,

224
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.760
Jesus.
Christmas.
That's right.
That's right.

225
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:51.490
You fucking Canadian freaks.
We're bringing the thunder.

226
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.070
I got so much shit to talk to people about.

227
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.610
It's been an interesting few months down here in America.

228
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.170
I like to go up to Canada because they love shit on America.
That's why.

229
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.650
That's why,
that's where I get off my best America jokes,

230
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.650
self deprecating American jokes.
So I love America folks.

231
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.230
Not pretending I'm not wanting,
not like I'm trying to draw in Canada.

232
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.540
Why don't you just go to kid once?
You each go up,
dude,

233
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.510
you fucking love him so much.
Why don't you marry Canada?

234
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.650
It's the highlight of what I just said.

235
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.130
Is it people that are taking themselves too fucking serious these days?

236
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.490
We've got a real problem with it will be real fucking problem with it.

237
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.200
People just looking to get pissed off about nothing all day.

238
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:40.150
Everyone just looking to get pissed off every fucking youtube comment and conti

239
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:44.650
Twitter name reflects this.
It's everywhere.
Everybody just needs to chill.

240
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.260
What are you showing this girl for?
I made it.
I made this girl last night,

241
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:51.610
that massage.
Thanks.
Should I wear my shirt after I was done with her?
Brian,

242
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.950
are you serious?
No,

243
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:58.180
that's the Rosie Rosie train comedian.

244
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.200
Excuse me.
As silly bitch

245
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.650
bitch out
experience.

246
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.330
Ge.
Ah,

247
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.490
hello friends,
neighbors

248
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.920
fucker when you do and we're doing it old school.
Just me and Brian Today.

249
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.810
We're just sitting around and we decided to do a podcast just like,
like day one,

250
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.420
day one,
the old old school days.

251
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.120
And that's the disgusting sip of coffee that people complain about the most.

252
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.400
We're just talking about that man.

253
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.730
There's a lot of God damn complaints in this world.
A lot of people are mad.

254
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.740
All the folks on God,
like productions.com I'm so sorry I upset you.

255
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.040
I did not mean to you.

256
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.260
<v 0>And uh,
although we disagree on things folks,
I think we can be civil.</v>

257
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.910
I really do you think I'm an idiot because I don't believe what you believe.

258
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.760
I'm okay.
I'm,
I'm fine with that.

259
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.360
But what I think ladies and gentlemen is that in looking at these subjects,

260
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.830
whether the chem trails or cunty behavior or if there's a lot of different

261
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:16.010
points of view on things,
but,
uh,

262
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.030
what I really liked about that mic west guy that we had on yesterday as he's not

263
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.150
mean about it,
you know,
he doesn't,
he's not creating enemies.

264
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.010
He's creating Tony Hawk,
man.
He created Tony Arc.
That's,
I mean,
that's awesome.

265
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.890
That was the coolest thing.
I right there.
I mean,
he had,

266
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.390
he owned part owned one of the most successful companies and video games ever.

267
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.890
I mean,
yeah,
that's a great company.
Well,
he's a bad motherfucker.
He's,
uh,

268
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.120
and you know,
it's,
it kind of bums me out.
I think he's just exceptional guy.

269
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.170
And it kind of bums me out that a lot of people thought he was a government

270
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:52.940
shill and they got mad at me for having him on and he's got a point of view

271
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.930
folks.
And that point of view may be right.
And you know,

272
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.900
there's parts of your point of view that may have merit,

273
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.780
but I think there's a lot of people out there that aren't willing to consider

274
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:07.730
the possibility that parts of their point of view or a little wacky,
you know?

275
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:09.170
And when a guy like that comes along,

276
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:11.330
like he's gotta be working for the government,
you know,

277
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.980
like I was saying about tower seven yet.
Yeah.

278
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:15.530
It looks like a controlled demolition.
He says it does too,

279
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.090
but I don't know shit about making a building.
I really don't.

280
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.570
I know Jack Shit,
I don't know a goddamn thing.

281
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.710
And to pretend that you do,
if you know as much as I do about it,

282
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.160
and to pretend like if I know for a fact that you don't have any more

283
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:35.600
information than I do about making buildings and you start arguing about Tarot

284
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:39.960
seven,
I'll call bullshit.
Because I know for me,
I've,

285
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.300
if we have the same amount of knowledge,

286
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.430
I don't know a fucking thing about how that fell.
I've no idea.
I would,

287
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:48.410
I would not know how you would control demolition one.

288
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.310
If you told me that they could control demolition of building,

289
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:54.710
where they would blow it up to bring it down.
I'd be like,

290
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:58.580
that's not how they do it.
I feel like if I didn't know that it existed,

291
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.260
if you brought it to,
he said,
listen,

292
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.000
I'm thinking about taking down this building.

293
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:05.300
What am I gonna do is I'm gonna set dynamite in it all throughout it and if I do

294
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:09.770
it correctly,
it's gonna explode and it'll all collapse.
I'd be like,

295
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:11.210
what a stupid fucking way.

296
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.730
Why don't you just chip away at it from the top to the bottom?

297
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.360
That's what I would say.
I would say,
why the fuck are you doing that?

298
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:21.470
What did those wrecking ball thing for?
Don't you use those?
Use that thing.

299
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.160
Don't blow it up,
but they blow them up all the time.
They blow it up.

300
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:28.850
It's like a standard thing.
So what the fuck do I know?
I,

301
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.130
I've looked at it and it looks like a controlled demolition,

302
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.390
but the reality is I,
and I have to face that head on.

303
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.410
I don't know shit about structural engineering like zero.

304
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:43.430
I know zero and people that do dough it,

305
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.760
you know that are architects and it's not their specialty.

306
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.030
They can be wrong about stuff.
One thing I

307
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.940
<v 3>always wonder,
judge,</v>

308
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:55.941
you always seem to always have a slight conspiracy with a lot of things and

309
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.290
it's,
you know,
over years a couple of those things faded away.
Like I,
you know,

310
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.630
first when you first heard the aids thing and you're like,
hey,

311
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:04.464
just doesn't exist.

312
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.430
<v 0>I never said that.
I never said that.
What I said is these people say it doesn't,</v>

313
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.070
right,
right.
I never believed it and I still don't believe it to this day.

314
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.600
But you're a diehard about it.
It's what I mean.

315
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.640
What I'm die hard about is the fact that I do think that there might be some

316
00:18:18.641 --> 00:18:22.930
merit to some of what the,
not the aids deniers have said,

317
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.000
but the people that are saying that when they're measuring AIDS in Africa,

318
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.810
they're adding to this number of people that have contracted HIV and gotten
aids.

319
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.430
What I've been told is it,

320
00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:37.360
a lot of those people actually didn't get measured for HIV.
They just have aids.

321
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.430
And so you're dealing with a host of different reasons why they could have

322
00:18:40.431 --> 00:18:42.850
gotten aids.
It could be massive malnutrition.

323
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.850
And it doesn't mean there's not people that are getting HIV and getting aids

324
00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:49.250
either.
It's not like they're mutually exclusive,
but it's like there's some,
uh,

325
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.540
some,
some weirdness probably with the numbers that you're,

326
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:56.470
they're linking it to this a sexually transmitted disease.

327
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.500
So when this guy is talking about this disease,
you know,
like a,

328
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.380
like a Peter Duesberg,
it's the guy,

329
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.430
a guy who doesn't believe that HIV causes AIDS.

330
00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.570
The real problem is there's so many people that do,

331
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.400
and if there's a whole industry involved in medicine,
I mean it's,
it's,

332
00:19:15.401 --> 00:19:18.910
it's not just a,
a bunch of doctors that are comparing notes.

333
00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:21.580
There's a lot of money involved and there's a lot,
there's a lot of,

334
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.280
there's a lot of different universities that are teaching medicine that are

335
00:19:27.281 --> 00:19:30.580
heavily invested in the future of medicine is constantly getting better.

336
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.980
It's like pretty measurable all the time.

337
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.550
So the idea that something like this would slip between the cracks and they

338
00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.010
wouldn't realize that HIV doesn't really cause any,
it's just like,

339
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.900
I don't understand how that's even possible and I'm too stupid when it comes to

340
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.910
the,
the,
the business of medicine or even the science of medicine.

341
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.370
I'm too ignorant to even engage in the conversation,

342
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.110
but it doesn't make sense to me that,
that many people,
even if it was like,

343
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.400
if it was some sort of a mistake that it had been made in the past,

344
00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:04.660
I feel like it'd be impossible for them to keep that quiet.
But I don't know,

345
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.970
you know,
I don't know the moon thing.
The moon one is a big one.
Yeah,

346
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.710
that's a big one because,
um,
I got really roped in by this Fox special,

347
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.100
there's a Fox special called a conspirator,

348
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.740
think it was called conspiracy theory.
Did we go to the mood?
And it was awesome.

349
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.730
And,
um,

350
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.660
it was fox I guess wasn't leaning as conservative back then or something like

351
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:29.170
that.
It wasn't like Fox News.
Yes,
it was like Fox,
you know,

352
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.180
dramatic reality TV show ish.
And,
um,

353
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.030
it was a great fucking special.
It really got me,

354
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.190
they had an astronauts saying that they could have faked going to the moon

355
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.070
astronaut.
Yeah.
Brian O'leary.
Yeah.
Yeah.

356
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.230
We said that if it was possible that if they didn't get it or if the they

357
00:20:48.231 --> 00:20:50.590
footage got destroyed,
that they would fake it.

358
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.840
And I remember hearing that going wide.
And then,
you know,

359
00:20:55.841 --> 00:21:00.841
you start looking at documentaries that support the idea that we didn't go to

360
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:05.540
the moon.
It's very compelling.
There's a really good English one,
a,

361
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.050
I forgot the name of it.
They're very compelling.

362
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.880
But when you go online and then start reading the arguments against all their

363
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:16.810
arguments,
it's a pretty compelling that the wrong about a lot of shit.

364
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.050
Just a lot.
They're wrong about so much.

365
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.940
There's so many things that they say,
uh,
in the,
uh,
the ones where they're,

366
00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:27.160
they're trying to say that we didn't go to the moon.

367
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.440
There's so many things that they say that don't make any sense.

368
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.330
The things that make sense or some of the photographs.
Um,
there's,

369
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:39.331
there's some images that look like really staged and not just a look really

370
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:41.920
stage,
but like the way their lit,
it's really odd.

371
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.820
<v 3>But don't you think that would be something where there's so many people that</v>

372
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:47.210
would have to be involved for that to actually,
yeah.
You know,

373
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.750
one person on their death bed would scream it and you would find it.

374
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.770
<v 0>No,
it's true.
That's,
that's the major argument against it.
In fact,
the major,</v>

375
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.250
major argument against it is human nature that people wouldn't be able to keep a

376
00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:03.630
secret that long.
Right.
You know,
I've read that,
uh,
that Bill Clinton quote,

377
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.280
which is a fantastic quote
about the moon landing,

378
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.620
and it always freaks me out and it's,
it's such a conspiracy theorist,

379
00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:17.700
wet dream of a post because,
you know,
Bill Clinton,

380
00:22:17.701 --> 00:22:19.320
his fucking Bill Clinton,
you know,

381
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:23.190
he's a former president of the United States and he's writing a book about his

382
00:22:23.191 --> 00:22:24.840
time in his life.

383
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.990
And in this book he writes about the experience of talking to an old carpenter

384
00:22:31.051 --> 00:22:32.310
about the moon landings.

385
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:37.950
I mean it's a crazy quote because what he's essentially says,
I'll read it.

386
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.690
<v 3>I was really high when I left that as fuck.
Thinking about blow jobs.</v>

387
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.280
I mean Shit,
when we got to write a book here,
I fucking hate books.

388
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:50.190
I don't read what if that was like his writing partner?
Just did that.

389
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:50.911
Throw that in there.

390
00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:54.150
Cause he was a big conspiracy theorist guy and then he GI bill just actually

391
00:22:54.151 --> 00:22:57.330
never read that book.
Just fucked him.
Come on man.

392
00:22:57.331 --> 00:23:00.270
You know I don't have time for raid.
What do I like?

393
00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:05.160
I like head and cheeseburgers.
Okay.
Why ain't giving me books on,

394
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.620
have you had,
wait,
are you allowed to eat burgers anymore?
No,

395
00:23:07.621 --> 00:23:08.590
I don't need cheeseburgers.

396
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.310
So you haven't even tried the Pretzel Burger from Wendy's?
No,

397
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:15.540
I'm not fucking with,
it's like the Baconator but they add pretzel.
It's great.

398
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.060
A Baconator with Pretzel.
Yeah.

399
00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:23.061
It's just a mushy mess of pretzels and cheese and burn rights to try to kill

400
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:26.490
you.
Do you understand this?
They're trying to do,
that's not good.

401
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.350
<v 0>That sounds terrible for you.
Yeah.
You don't care?</v>

402
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.600
<v 3>No,
no.
I don't know if I had it once.
I'm just saying it's great.</v>

403
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.580
You just had it though.

404
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.720
<v 0>I have made a decision this year to clean up various aspects of my life and a</v>

405
00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:45.920
big one being diet,
right?
Yeah.
Just the,
the,
the

406
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.780
<v 2>constant eating of certain things that I know are not healthy and in a cutting</v>

407
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:55.781
out gluten and it's such a fucking fatty thing that I hate even talking about

408
00:23:56.721 --> 00:23:58.400
it.
Everyone's cutting out gluten.

409
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.180
It feels so gross when you tell people you're not eating gluten.
It's like,
Oh,

410
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:06.050
you bought into that.
It's like you,
you immediately get roped into this,

411
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.950
this fad category and that's not what I'm saying at all.

412
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.600
I'm saying I don't think it's good for you.
I don't think it's a fad.
I think in,

413
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:19.550
in,
in me eating gluten,
I was doing my body damage.

414
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.260
Like in no uncertain terms.
Yeah.
I mean it is kind of fatty to like,

415
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.270
yeah,
I'm pretty much gluten free.
Dairy,
dairy man.
Yeah.

416
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.970
There is not good for you.
You know,

417
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.690
like you always talk about that raw milk and shit.
I'm like,
I am.
I hate milk.

418
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.460
I hate,
I have zero calcium in my body.
If I fall down,
I'm like ms Mr. Burns.
Yeah,

419
00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:44.960
I think,
um,
you're better off with nothing with no milk,

420
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.760
but if you're going to have milk,
raw milk is not bad on occasion.
I just think,

421
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:54.140
uh,
we,
we take in a lot of dairy and it is a weird thing for our bodies,

422
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.620
but some people can process it without a problem,
you know?

423
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:59.580
And some people have real issues with it.
It,

424
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.840
we're not supposed to fuck with cows.
Maybe the Indians are right.
Maybe,

425
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.710
but when you drink it,
I'm telling you,
man,
if you drink it raw,

426
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.110
you don't really have nearly as many problems to adjusting it.

427
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.770
Like a lot of people who are lactose intolerant or only lactose intolerant when

428
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:15.890
it's her modernizer pasteurized.
I shouldn't say a lot of people,

429
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:20.000
but certain people,
what have I counted?
I had done a census.
No,

430
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.430
just talking mad shit.
Um,
this is the,
uh,

431
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.830
this is the Bill Clinton quote because it's so crazy.

432
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.380
This is right out of his book.
He says,

433
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:35.470
just just a month before Apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong,

434
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.850
I left their colleague,
Michael Collins,
a board spaceship,

435
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.680
Colombian walked on the moon beating by five months.

436
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.500
President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade,

437
00:25:46.501 --> 00:25:47.334
right was out.

438
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:53.160
The old cop and asked me if I really believed it happened.
I said,
sure.

439
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.580
I saw it on television.
He disagreed.

440
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.040
He said that he didn't believe anything.

441
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.970
He didn't believe it for a minute and that them television fillers could make

442
00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:08.100
things look real that weren't back then.

443
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.490
I thought he was a crank during my eight years in Washington.

444
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.900
I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if it wasn't ahead of his time.

445
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.250
That's a cookie quote.

446
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.143
<v 4>Okay.</v>

447
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.300
<v 2>It is a cookie quote,
no matter how you slice it.</v>

448
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.470
Has anyone asked him about that quote?
Um,
like did we just did,

449
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.170
oh,
we just,
we just heard Mr President,
please turn it on.

450
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.380
Right on the record though.
Like,

451
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:40.580
I mean that seems like such a powerful quote that somebody somewhere had to,

452
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:42.900
it filmed him like,
hey,
can I ask you one question about this?

453
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.290
I don't think people want to fuck with the moon landings.
Um,
my friend,
uh,

454
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.210
Todd Mccormick has the best quote about it.
He said it's a technological Jesus.

455
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.230
He said,
cause if it really did pull it off and you know,
it really,
they really,

456
00:26:56.231 --> 00:26:59.970
it actually fake going to the moon.
Like oh my God,

457
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.050
what an incredible in horrific embarrassment.

458
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.000
And if they did go to the moon and your talking about it and you're like,

459
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:12.270
you know,
pretending that they didn't,
you're a crazy person.

460
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.990
Like if they actually went to the,

461
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.850
and these guys really did rest of their lives and go 250,000 miles and land on

462
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:21.150
the moon and then come back for the first time ever that people had been

463
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:26.280
actually in deep space and back and in and lived and touched and land on an

464
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:29.070
object and came back from that object first time ever.

465
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.440
I mean you would be such a douchebag if you were saying that they didn't do it

466
00:27:34.441 --> 00:27:37.480
and they did do it.
I 100% of the thing.
We went to the man.

467
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.090
It's most likely that we did.

468
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.770
Most likely I still leave open the possibility that some of that was horse shit

469
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.410
just because Dan was just how they rocked it back then and there's also,

470
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.450
there's a,
the guy who was a Jesus Christ,
what does his fucking name,

471
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.960
there's the safety inspector tunnel,
Thomas Ronald Baron.

472
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.850
He was hired by,

473
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:05.330
by Congress to do a detailed safety analysis of NASA and he handed in this long

474
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:09.390
report that said that NASA was in such disarray that they would never get a man

475
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:14.100
into space.
He died on the train tracks,

476
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.430
parked in a car with his family shortly thereafter and the report went bye bye

477
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.740
and that's real.
There's weird shit to the moon landings.

478
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.220
Not like one weird thing,
but a bunch of weird things.

479
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.080
There's weird things to it.

480
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.220
It's a most likely that we definitely went,

481
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.610
but it's also possible that there's some fuckery going on because they did a

482
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:43.611
little fuckery back then with publicity photos that Gemini 15 photo is one of

483
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:46.620
them that shows Michael Collins floating in space and they said he was on a

484
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:47.430
space walk,

485
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.230
but then it's the exact same photo just reversed of him in a training facility.

486
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.640
It's a famous photo.

487
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.850
<v 3>Yeah,
but it's a publicity photo.
Exactly.
But Bliss,
that's what it's,
you know,</v>

488
00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.430
I mean that if I give you a photo of like,
hey,
you need Joe Rogan,

489
00:29:00.431 --> 00:29:03.400
like crazy publicity photo for his show and I had a lens flare to your,

490
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.100
your balls.
If they're going to be like,
wait a second,
let's Linds players.

491
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.700
<v 2>That's a good point.
If it was a publicity photo,</v>

492
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.720
if it wasn't actually released as a,
an actual factual photo of space,

493
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.450
I think it kind of was,
but that could also,

494
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.510
that's not even indicative of the whole company being full of Shit.

495
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.240
It could be just one photographic editor.

496
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.400
There's just thinks he's slick and he's like,
look,

497
00:29:24.401 --> 00:29:26.200
I'll just put this guy in space.
Right.
You know,

498
00:29:26.201 --> 00:29:28.420
it doesn't mean that NASA is full of Shit,
it's just,

499
00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.120
but when people see things like that they go,

500
00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:34.540
Oh okay well I'm going to be suspicious he now cause you're not in totally on

501
00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:37.660
the up and up.
You know there's,
there's certain aspects of,

502
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:42.040
of the story that make you go,
oh okay well there's something,
some,
there's some

503
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 0>fuckery at some levels and it's unfortunate that you can,</v>

504
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.950
you can get that from a single picture that's been edited but you can,
you know,

505
00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:54.640
you could do it raises the possibilities.
So most likely,
yeah they went,

506
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.570
most likely they went.

507
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:01.140
But I always leave in that one one possible opening for a crazy scenario where

508
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:07.510
they faked the whole thing and got Stanley Kubrick behind it and spent billions

509
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.140
of dollars of black budget money and filmed it and then told the astronauts,

510
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.260
listen bitch,
you're,
no one's going to believe you.
You're a national hero.

511
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:15.670
You went to the moon,
just deal with it.

512
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.360
I mean that to me is so compelling as well.

513
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:24.460
Cause it almost would explain how crazy we are.
I would almost explain like the,

514
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:29.390
the difference between the the United States of the future that we saw and like

515
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:33.490
the 1970s on television and when it really became,
as far as like space travel,

516
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.210
space travel just stopped.
It just stopped.

517
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.330
It's like we don't even do the shuttle really anymore.
I mean we,

518
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.020
we have to like borrow the Russians to go up to the space station.
We're like,

519
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:45.640
we just stopped and people say,

520
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:48.220
well it's because of lack of funding and that is absolutely true.

521
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.070
That's absolutely the case.
But it's still weird.

522
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:56.310
It's still weird that between 1969 in 1972 we flew out and landed on the moon

523
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.380
and came back and we did it a bunch of times and then we're like,
we're done.

524
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.790
That's it.
Done.

525
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:06.400
Now we just go 300 miles and that's it.
No higher than that.

526
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.940
400 miles Max.
Like people don't go above 400 miles.

527
00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:14.050
Like the last time people have been above 400 miles is the Paulsboro space

528
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:17.370
programs.
So again,
most likely.
Yeah,

529
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.300
most likely they went to the moon for sure.
But I,
I am the Dork in me.

530
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:22.990
The,

531
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.190
the conspiracy loon that's still alive and the corner of the back of my brain

532
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.920
holding onto an ember and blowing on it every now and then,

533
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.910
trying to keep the fire of madness alive,

534
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.550
still wants to believe that they could affect it.

535
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.210
<v 3>We just need to get Neil degrasse Tyson back in there too.</v>

536
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.680
I love that guy so much.
I'm such a fan.
If to me they'd be like arguing with

537
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.390
<v 0>Paul Mccartney or about whether it was his music is good.
Yeah.</v>

538
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.160
And I'm not an argument about it any man,
but that's so bullshit.

539
00:31:52.161 --> 00:31:55.970
So contradictory because I do argue about it,
but what I mean about it is I'm,

540
00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.690
I'm really not committed.
It sounds,
that sounds like bullshit to that.

541
00:31:59.691 --> 00:32:02.540
I'm not committed to one side or the other.
I'm being totally honest.

542
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:07.750
Most likely they went to the moon most likely like 99% but the honest childlike

543
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.840
idiot in me,
the child like idiot who loves mysteries,

544
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.060
we'll fucking hold out for that bitch.

545
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.730
<v 3>You really need to write a movie man about like the faking the moon landing and</v>

546
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.501
make it ridiculous,

547
00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:27.260
like big foot's in there with a werewolf and one of those cool Scifi movies
like,

548
00:32:27.261 --> 00:32:32.130
uh,
like Sharknado,
oh my God,
the Werewolf going on in space.

549
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.440
What do you think it is?

550
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.380
<v 0>Why do people want to believe that there are grand conspiracies?</v>

551
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.190
That there's these,
you know,
people

552
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.080
<v 2>love to talk about grand conspiracies that may or may not exist,</v>

553
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.860
but they invest a lot of time and a lot of effort into these fucking things.

554
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.650
I think it's just like the same people that do that with Jesus and God and

555
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:57.680
religion and stuff like that,
that if you take that out,
like,
Hey,

556
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:58.431
I'm not religious,

557
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:02.570
but I need to obsess and find secrets of other things that don't exist.

558
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.170
Is that it?
You know,
there's,
there's a searching for something and the answer,

559
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.840
yeah.
There's a lot of people that believe that that's like a genetic thing.

560
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:09.500
They're like,

561
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:14.500
there's a gene for like religious belief that it's actually a part of a,

562
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.220
you know,
a part of who we are as human beings.
I mean,

563
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:23.240
I grew up religious by force and my mom's super religious,

564
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:27.530
but when I don't have to go,
I'm not even thinking about it,
you know?

565
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.220
But I don't,
if I had to go back and do it once in a while,

566
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.280
I have no problem with that.
It's kind of relaxing.
It's like being in a,
you know,

567
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.263
a tanning bed.

568
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.340
It's kind of like a place where everybody is guaranteed to be chill,

569
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.740
but it's going to be all about Jesus.

570
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:45.260
They're all going to be God likes or they're going to be real pleasant with each

571
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:47.720
other.
Like there's a lot of benefits to having a church,

572
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:52.460
that atheist kind of a shoe,
you know,
throw aside.

573
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.250
And in a lot of ways the right,
because it's like,
okay,

574
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:56.420
we're going to get those benefits.

575
00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:00.650
But in return you're going to give up your personal freedom if freedom of

576
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:05.260
behavior,
your freedom of,
uh,
you know,
have to love and marry who you want.

577
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.560
You didn't give a blot of shit.

578
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.040
But in return you get a nice place to go on Sunday where everybody's going to be

579
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:14.750
nice and they're going to us all sing stupid ass songs together and they're

580
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:17.620
going to be showered and it's like an excuse to dress up nice once in a woman

581
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.820
dressed up nice and,
uh,

582
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:24.480
try to reinforce the good behavior habits of the community.
I mean there's Ben,

583
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.420
there's merit in that and it's unfortunate that it has to be done for a lot of

584
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:32.450
folks through an invisible deity.
But you know,

585
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:34.820
they would probably argue the smarter ones amongst them.

586
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:37.550
That spirituality in itself is trying to,
you know,

587
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:40.610
it's like a cop out to say you don't believe in God,
but you know,

588
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.780
you believe in a higher power.
Like what,
what exactly is that higher power Ni?

589
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:45.231
I mean,

590
00:34:45.231 --> 00:34:49.820
what definition do you have of God that's so bulletproof as written by the

591
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.660
Bible.
You,
if you're,
say you believe in a higher power,
but you know,
you're,

592
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:56.450
you're more spiritual than religious.
Like what,
what are you even saying?

593
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.720
Like what a,
what exactly are you saying?
Have you been in church for a while?

594
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.021
Like,

595
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:03.020
I haven't been for a while and I'm thinking maybe there'd be cool things to do.

596
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.561
Like get it,

597
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:06.380
bring a laser pointers that when you see one of those kids playing with the toys

598
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:08.690
and you can just like fuck with the kid the whole time.
That might be fine.

599
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:13.400
Dad's NYSID
churches,
not for games.

600
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.210
You've missed the whole point of church.
It's for worship now.
I've never been,

601
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.420
you know,
a,
I haven't been since I was a little kid.
I mean,

602
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.230
but I know people who like it,
man,
they really like it.
They're nice people.

603
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.670
They liked going to church and you know,

604
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:31.160
if you have your idea of what it means to be God,
what it means to be Jesus,

605
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.670
you know,
and if you have your idea and that idea empowers you,

606
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.010
there's a benefit in that.
And atheists don't want to

607
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.400
<v 0>admit to that.
They think the people should be able to get by without it.</v>

608
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:46.380
And they should.
You're right.
But the way to help them is not by belittling them.

609
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.910
It's more of biolog explaining to them,
you know,
if possible,

610
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:54.480
if they're open to it,
explaining to them exactly what religion is.

611
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.560
Because it's not that you're against God.
This has nothing to do with God.

612
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.140
It has nothing to do with even the idea of God.

613
00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.240
It's entirely based on people writing shit down and just because people are

614
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:10.560
saying that they represent God,
that you to listen to that.

615
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.770
It's just like listening to people that are telling you that they're from

616
00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:17.870
another planet or telling you that they're psychic there.
You're just,
you're,

617
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.300
you have to trust these crazy people.
You have to trust these people.
And that's,

618
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.850
that's the real problem with religion.
It's human beings.

619
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.050
It's not that the idea that there's a god man who not world so fucking crazy.

620
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:32.430
There could be a gun.
It really could be.
The world is so nuts,
man.

621
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.490
It's so,
so much of it does,

622
00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:38.070
it doesn't even seem real so much of the Syria thing and you're going about the

623
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:42.290
radiation leaking from Japan.
I mean every day it's like a,

624
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.300
of a bigger indication that this whole thing is just fucking bananas.

625
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:51.000
And no one knows how to keep the lid on it.

626
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.830
And there's billions of gallons of radioactive water leaking into the ocean and

627
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.690
they're killing people in Syria.

628
00:36:57.691 --> 00:37:01.740
And we're going to go kill people for killing people.
And whew,

629
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.190
God damn,
I mean it,
it feels,

630
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.210
it feels about as crazy and fake is.
It could be.

631
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.300
And I don't know how having a god would make it feel any less vague if a god

632
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:16.530
created all of us in this very disappointed in us.

633
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:21.530
Now that's not any less likely than a lot of things that are actually real.

634
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.060
You know?
And I'm not saying that I believe in God,
not saying that either.

635
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.060
I'm just saying how could,
how could you even know?

636
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.960
How could you know what the fuck is next?
How could you even have a guess?

637
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.050
I guess you could have possibilities as you know,

638
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.110
things he bounced around in your imagination,

639
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.660
especially if you've had psychedelic experiences.

640
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.470
You can have some possibilities.
But how the fuck do you know?
You don't know.

641
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:52.070
And to say you do is almost as bad as is.

642
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.160
It's almost as bad to pretend that you know there's no god is it is to pretend

643
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:01.980
that you're talking to God.
Right?
And yes,

644
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.633
even paying attention

645
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.480
<v 3>of course of year tried to have a conversation with an adult.
No,</v>

646
00:38:09.481 --> 00:38:12.540
I mean I always think you see the problem with being stone is that you start

647
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.800
talking about something and an idea and then while I'm just going off,

648
00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:20.220
that's interesting right there and start thinking about that one idea you're

649
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:23.210
still going on with,
you know what I mean?

650
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.220
You like slowed down the weeds slowed you down.
So that's right.

651
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:30.090
I started thinking about going off about something about God being simulation

652
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:34.230
theory.
I was thinking of simulation.
Did some cigarettes,
man,

653
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.010
that cigarettes fucking with you.

654
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.540
<v 0>Fuck with your mind.
Hey,
did you read that thing about I'm gaining weight.
Um,</v>

655
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.160
there was a in today about it had to do with cigarettes that they've found a

656
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:48.670
reason why people gain weight after they quit cigarettes.

657
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.110
And it has to do with the changing of the,
uh,
stomach flora,

658
00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.540
which really interesting stuff.

659
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.650
<v 3>I thought it was just because it made your heart go faster,</v>

660
00:38:58.651 --> 00:39:02.280
so on and off more coherently.
Not apparently not.

661
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.880
I got to find this thing and you crave putting things in your mouth,
you know,

662
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.040
<v 0>I don't want to know about all that.
Okay.</v>

663
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.270
You crave and shit in your mouth.
Ooh,

664
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.610
I'm trying to find this.
Um,

665
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:16.590
<v 3>I,</v>

666
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.590
there has to be a link to cigarettes and breastfeeding and breastfeeding.

667
00:39:21.601 --> 00:39:21.960
Yeah.

668
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.920
Something about breastfeeding too much maybe or breastfeeding too little and

669
00:39:25.921 --> 00:39:29.820
then the whole cigarette thing is also just putting something in your mouth all

670
00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.760
the time for you for it.
No,
that's what I mean.
Like when you quit smoking,

671
00:39:32.761 --> 00:39:37.761
you people buy suckers or candy or gum cause you're constantly trying to do

672
00:39:38.131 --> 00:39:42.180
something with your mouth.
Really.
Yeah.
It's like a oral fixation type thing.

673
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.050
<v 0>Disco Sucks.
Some Cox,
you know,
you want to,
yeah,</v>

674
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:51.350
whatever.
Cigarettes.
Hold on.

675
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.830
Typing this into Google.
I can't find it.
I know I retweeted it.

676
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.060
Sometimes a Twitter doesn't retweet things.
The you ask it to you?
No,
no sir.

677
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.170
<v 3>Um,
usually if,</v>

678
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.440
what probably happens is that somebody who may be deleted the tweet and then re

679
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.020
like changed like a spelling error or re posted it.

680
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.540
<v 0>Right,
right.
Yeah.
Here it goes.
A scientist's link,</v>

681
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:18.541
weight gain from quitting smoking to a shift in gut bacteria correlated with

682
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:22.120
obesity.
That is amazing.
You know,

683
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:27.121
they're finding out more and more that stomach flora and it has a massive impact

684
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.960
on your mood,
your behavior,
your immune system,

685
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.540
all sorts of different shit as affected by the,
uh,

686
00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:38.440
amount of bacteria that it literally can change your behavior.

687
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.020
<v 3>And so how do you protect it?
Is He using like those milk or yogurt shots?</v>

688
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:43.854
Is that the same time?

689
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:48.150
<v 0>Yeah,
those will help you.
Those are our healthy bacteria.
That's a,</v>

690
00:40:48.151 --> 00:40:49.290
those are probiotic.

691
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.000
Sauerkraut is very probiotic too for people who don't like 'em raw sauerkraut,

692
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:58.020
especially Kimchi is very probiotic.
I love Kimchi.
That's stuff's delicious.

693
00:40:58.021 --> 00:41:01.030
I love Sauerkraut.
You can eat if you eat.
Yeah.

694
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.000
Make sure it's the right time of a lot.
That's probiotic.
Find out like,

695
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:09.870
do a little Google search on what's the best probiotic.
Um,
uh,
Sauerkraut,

696
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.710
I think a lot of natural sauerkraut is naturally probiotic because it's sort of

697
00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:18.690
fermenting and growing bacteria in it.
Um,
and uh,
Kombucha,

698
00:41:18.691 --> 00:41:21.960
that's what I like.
But acid office is a big ones from no culture.

699
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.750
Acid office is a good one too because it's very aggressive like a,

700
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.210
they say that acidophilus is good in preventing certain sicknesses because
it'll,

701
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.130
it's a flora that like stays on your skin and if it's,
if

702
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.540
<v 2>it's healthy,
if you have a lot of it,</v>

703
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.860
it's sorta deters the infection by other things that you might touch.

704
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.690
But that could be harsh it since I'm not a doctor,

705
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.890
but I thought you would think this is pretty interesting.

706
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.500
So cause I know you had complained that that was a problem.

707
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.810
Like when you'd quit smoking then it would be like a real problem with um,

708
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.290
with four or holding your weight.
Yeah,

709
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.910
<v 3>it's whole,
it's just,
cause I mean when you smoke cigarettes,
you don't have a,</v>

710
00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.410
you don't really think of food as much.
Like it creates,

711
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.270
takes your cravings of food away.

712
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.910
<v 2>Somebody needs to hire Joey Diaz to do when those blu cigarette commercials,</v>

713
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:12.740
because he smokes those things all day.
Now I go,
what are you doing?
I go,

714
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:16.130
are you smoking cigarettes again?
Same cigarette dogs is nothing.

715
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.340
Barely comes out.
It's like a little mess.
There's nothing coming out of there.

716
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.200
I'm like,
you're smoking cigarettes

717
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.910
<v 3>and he's watching spongebob squarepants which is hilarious because I remember</v>

718
00:42:24.911 --> 00:42:29.720
the day at Cobb's in San Francisco.
He goes,
I was talking about a South Park.
Yep.

719
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.720
<v 2>You're fucking cartoons.
You watching cartoons.</v>

720
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.720
He starts going on this rampage about how you watched it for his ultimate bait.

721
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.150
I know,
but he loves it now.
Love Spongebob.
Squarepants this is like his favorite.

722
00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.710
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
He was so fucking funny this weekend.

723
00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:49.240
Oh my God,
I'm going to Waukee.
Yeah.
He's so funny.
He's like,

724
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.590
he's in his prime right now.
You know?
He's like,
he's in this rare era.

725
00:42:53.591 --> 00:42:55.660
He's got this fucking Liberace joke.

726
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.390
It's one of my favorite jokes that he's ever done and it's like,

727
00:42:58.391 --> 00:42:59.950
it's getting better every time you see it.

728
00:42:59.951 --> 00:43:03.010
Like he keeps adding to it and fixing it and tweaking it.

729
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.310
He's killing them out there.
So fun dude.

730
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:10.360
He's working it and that dude's he works.
Oh,
he definitely works.

731
00:43:10.361 --> 00:43:13.450
He puts it a lot of work.
But it's also,
he's,
he's getting better too.

732
00:43:13.451 --> 00:43:17.200
It's really fun.
I just love people that still love stand up.
You know.

733
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.640
Joey fucking loves it.
He loves it.
He really,
really enjoys it.
You know,

734
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:24.940
like he has no problem like hanging out with people and,
and uh,

735
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.570
talking to people after the shows.
He really enjoys it.
Hey,

736
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:32.440
did you a I put this on Twitter.
That's another interesting story.
Um,

737
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.530
it's that men experience a blow to their self esteem when their female partners

738
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:42.550
experienced success,
even when they aren't in direct competition.

739
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.380
Isn't that crazy?

740
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.840
Women's success also negatively impacts how men view the future of the

741
00:43:49.841 --> 00:43:54.520
relationship.
Researchers found.
That's incredible.
First of all,

742
00:43:54.521 --> 00:43:59.060
researchers researching,
I'm,
we're researching breakups.
Wait,
wait.
So you're,

743
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.200
what you're saying is if they're more successful,

744
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.580
that scares the person.
It's apparently that's exactly what they're saying.

745
00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.560
I think it's implying is that a man wants a woman to be weak.

746
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.820
And if the woman proves that she is successful,

747
00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:19.030
that she can be independent of the man,
that it's very threatening.

748
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.920
<v 3>I Dunno,
because I can think of it both ways.
Like,</v>

749
00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:25.520
cause I know a girl that so many girls that don't have jobs,
you know,

750
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:28.460
and it's just like,
God,
you got to do something.
What are you doing?

751
00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:31.190
Living off welfare,
sleeping on people's couches.
I mean like,

752
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.280
that is the biggest challenge.
Do you know like that?
Like 50,
60 just kidding.

753
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.950
But no,
I few girls,
but I mean,

754
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.760
and trying to go anywhere like relationship wise with them,

755
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.890
that was a huge turnoff because it's like,
come on,

756
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:46.750
what am I going to take care of this person for the rest of my life?
You know,

757
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.740
like what am I saying my daddy?
Is that what I'm going to be Daddy?
Yeah.

758
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.310
<v 0>Well,
it's also,
you're dating girls that are much younger,
18,
19,
but yeah,</v>

759
00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:00.190
their children,
they just escape from their home and they're abusive home.
Um,

760
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:03.540
<v 3>I met a girl recently that I say this,
uh,
I met a girl recently</v>

761
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:07.770
<v 0>think that was older than her mom.
Oh Christ.
That's so gross.</v>

762
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.620
You silly bitch.
It's weird.

763
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.890
I kind of can see how for a lot of men that are insecure,

764
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:17.920
that would be like a real thing.
It's fucking hard to be secure with like a,

765
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.980
a really powerful woman in a relationship.

766
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.960
Can you imagine if you were like dating Jennifer Lopez and she's like a,

767
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.940
what are you doing today?
And you're like,
oh,
I'm going to go to do a podcast.

768
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.090
And she's like,
Oh really?
Well I'm hosting the Grammy's.
Yeah.

769
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:32.010
And your puts on some diamonds.

770
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.550
Wiggles her ass in of funny and walks out the door and took a bunch of dudes

771
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:38.030
hold up the door for her and she slides into a limousine,

772
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.220
photographers snap a picture and then she darts off and like,
damn,

773
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:44.430
that bitch doesn't need me at all.
She doesn't even need me a little.

774
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.190
<v 3>Yeah.
But if you were both famous like that,</v>

775
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:51.540
I think it would work or like at least made enough to a point where you're just

776
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:54.060
like,
all right,
we're both chill with our,
you know,

777
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:56.010
we're both making good money to get,
you know,

778
00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.250
<v 0>maybe.
Yeah.
But maybe they compete against each other like superstars,
you know,</v>

779
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.170
maybe Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas,

780
00:46:02.171 --> 00:46:05.860
maybe that was part of the Duke was like how good he played Liberace.

781
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.050
<v 3>God Damn,
no,
they actually fucked like him and Matt Damon Probably.
Well,</v>

782
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.240
he's like,
I got to do it.
It's for the park.
That's why,

783
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.510
<v 0>um,
the,
uh,
the study,
I thought it was fascinating.
They,</v>

784
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.980
that they did a study on this,

785
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.310
but it also thought it was fascinating the results because they kind of make

786
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:26.820
sense.
I've known,
especially like for a week,
man,

787
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.220
you know,
it's,

788
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:36.570
I think it's probably really hard for a lot of dudes who are not like where they

789
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:39.750
want to be to deal with.
Like,
uh,

790
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.860
like a partner who's like maybe possibly surpassing them,
you know,

791
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:48.270
and like they're the social ladder or the perceived success ladder,

792
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.440
like passing them.

793
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:52.560
And like almost making them feel diminished by their own woman.

794
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:54.480
Like in competition,
like you,

795
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.870
you've met guys that like you can't play basketball with them because if they

796
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.920
lose they get,
they get shitty.
Have you ever met people like that or pool or,

797
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.360
or a video game?

798
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:03.641
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

799
00:47:03.641 --> 00:47:07.210
but I've also known [inaudible] ex girlfriends and women that I've known that

800
00:47:07.211 --> 00:47:11.860
got mad or jealous of like my position in my job.
Like,
Oh,

801
00:47:11.861 --> 00:47:14.680
you have to just get paid to talk all day.
But I have a black,

802
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.880
like I think it works.
I think it works both ways.

803
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.090
That's just,
again,
the people,
you're fucking hanging around with sun.

804
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:26.580
I have to put shit in my ass all day.
And when you have to talk price.

805
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.070
Yeah.
But you know that talking

806
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.450
<v 0>thing is something that you kind of like figured out how to get there.
All right.</v>

807
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:37.690
And if she wants to talk for a living,
she needs to figure out how to get there.

808
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.340
It's really that simple.
I mean,

809
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:43.330
just because you did doesn't mean that she can't.

810
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.450
And it also doesn't mean that somehow or another you took anything away from
her.

811
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:51.190
So when people are like Shitty to you about your thing that you're doing,

812
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.360
like you're,
you,
you,

813
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.810
you're missing out on a huge opportunity to be bored with your own life and do

814
00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:58.900
something about it.
Like to bitch about Ya.
You don't have to do anything.

815
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:03.430
I ain't doing it.
They're talking,
hey,
yeah,
you didn't even work.

816
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.410
I ain't seen Tak.
Ah,
you ever done a hurricane's mark in your life?
Next time.
Yes,

817
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:12.100
I've done about 20 years will get mad at you if you don't work hard.
Yeah.

818
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:15.730
Look at you with your manicured fingers.
You know,
if it's struggling,

819
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:20.420
you don't even hate,
you didn't even hate work and life,
right?
Yeah.

820
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.870
Folks,
it ain't about that.

821
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.410
It ain't about the guy who tries buying a clean car when you're dirty.

822
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.340
It's not his fault.
It's,
you should figure out how to be clean.

823
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.090
You should figure out how to do a job that doesn't involve you walking in mud

824
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:37.540
all day.
And that's possible because somebody else has done it.

825
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.880
And it doesn't mean I don't buy the idea that you know the society the way it is

826
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:44.080
right now.
It has to be this way.

827
00:48:44.081 --> 00:48:45.670
Someone's always going to have to work at Burger King.

828
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.440
Someone's always going to have to,
I don't buy that.

829
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.900
I think people are pretty fucking flexible.

830
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:55.050
If you look at the broad spectrum of humans and human behavior from different

831
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:58.960
cultures all over the world,
it's a pretty obvious to me that there's,

832
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.360
there's a lot of different ways that people can act.

833
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.080
We don't have to have fast food workers.
We don't,

834
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:08.470
we don't have to have people who work shit jobs.
We don't have to,

835
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.350
which you need to figure out how to restructure society.

836
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.610
So everybody somehow or another plays a part,
has something to contribute,

837
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.180
something to share.
I mean,
that's what a real society is supposed to be like.

838
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:22.420
I've given you some coconuts,
you give me some fish,
you know,

839
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:25.450
we make a deal and you'd do it back and forth and left and right.

840
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.210
And when there's nothing to contribute,
then you start looking.

841
00:49:29.211 --> 00:49:31.840
Lit President needs to give us jobs.
We need jobs.

842
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.850
So instead of something to contribute,

843
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:38.140
just find something to do with your time and then it becomes about doing that

844
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.630
more than it becomes about finding something to contribute.

845
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:45.810
So society gets wrapped around becoming a part of a machine society instead of

846
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:50.050
becoming a bunch of individuals that are expressing themselves and unique ways

847
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.790
and everybody's sort of borrows and shares and sells this and you sell that.

848
00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.550
And we all sort of figured out how we can contribute in a society.

849
00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:02.730
We got sidetracked and diverted into these boxes that they call companies and

850
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:07.690
corporations and we got stuck into these containers that go cubicles or offices

851
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.270
and we've got forced into this system.
So our time,

852
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.470
instead of it being invested in making pottery or,

853
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:19.471
or fixing cars or doing something where you have a passion or you have some sort

854
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:20.680
of a connection to,

855
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:25.681
instead of that you've sold your life to sit in a box and work for a machine,

856
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.770
an uncaring machine that demands productivity.
It doesn't understand you,

857
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:32.240
it doesn't want to understand you.

858
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.380
It has a bunch of very strict things in order to keep the humor at a minimum in

859
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:37.760
the office.
Just in case one,

860
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:41.990
he fuckheads says some stupid sex jokes that gets him sued and they have to give

861
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:46.400
somebody $1 million.
So get it together.
And this is your life now.

862
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.820
No natural behavior.
Everybody's wearing clothes they don't want to,

863
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:52.700
where everybody's showing up and doing something they don't want to do and they

864
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:56.360
have no connection to.
That's the problem with our society.

865
00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.320
And then what's the reward for all this stuff?
Go home,
get a big TV,
go home.

866
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:03.140
You're going to get a shiny belt buckle.
You're going to get a nice purse.

867
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:05.300
You're going to wear shoes that you couldn't afford last week.

868
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.860
You're going to get that dream car.

869
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.610
And every week we're chasing down this new object and every week we're trying to

870
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.460
fill this hole in this,
this,

871
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:18.490
this sad shadow of a life that we've been left with after work that you work

872
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:23.240
eight to whatever,
the hours a day plus commuting and then you'll like this

873
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.170
and that's your life.
That's your real fucking life.

874
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.800
All that other stuff is not your life anymore.
All that other stuff is work.

875
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.350
And most of us have committed to that.

876
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:37.680
I know you've been there before and I've been there before and we,

877
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:40.280
we understand that it's a trap because we got out of it,

878
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:41.750
but for the people that are in it,

879
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.030
a lot of times they don't even understand it's a trap.

880
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.350
They just think it's a good job.
I think they got dental.
I'm doing really good.

881
00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.740
I got my own parking spots,
got my name on it,
and you just,

882
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:56.690
a piece of a heartless shitty machine that makes money.

883
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.503
<v 4>Okay.</v>

884
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.980
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

885
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.150
I could just see like being cut into one of those youtube videos.

886
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:08.000
That's somebody who isn't in the background.
There's like people walking fast,

887
00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:11.480
then the sun rising really slow and we'll,
you know what,
man?

888
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.230
Somebody got to say that because if people don't hear it,

889
00:52:15.231 --> 00:52:16.970
they're going to get a bad job and they're gonna,

890
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:18.680
they're gonna waste their fucking life.
Right,

891
00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:22.790
but don't you think you'd have to go through all that just to figure out what

892
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:27.440
you want to do?
Because I didn't think I did,
but I don't think you have to look.

893
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:31.070
I,
I did,
but I became,
when I became a comedian,

894
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.480
when I was 21 I was 100% convinced that I was going to be a standup comedian for

895
00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:39.620
the rest of my life.
Like I didn't need to worry about what was next.
I was like,

896
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.190
oh,
this is what I'm doing.
Like I'm this,
no,

897
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:45.770
I don't want to do anything else like this.
This is what I'm doing.

898
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.420
Once I found it,
I was good.

899
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:52.250
All the jobs were just to feed myself while I was trying to make that work.

900
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.743
But it's,
um,

901
00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:58.250
to get one and commit to it and have it become a part of your life becomes

902
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:01.220
really problematic because if you're,

903
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.600
if you are a dirt bag like myself who drove limos and did construction and they

904
00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:06.434
always,
you know,

905
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.560
almost kind of temporary jobs and a lot of people drift in and out of,

906
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.090
there was nothing expected of you.

907
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.210
But if you get hired by a major corporation and become a big part of their,

908
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.000
their,
their,
you know,
their program.

909
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.360
Like let's say you're also an animator and you get a Gig.

910
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.690
Like I have a friend who,
uh,
was,
uh,

911
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.610
an illustrator and he was working for Nickelodeon and he got fired and he was

912
00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:31.080
panicking and he was like,
shit,
I don't know what the fuck to do.
He's like,
ah,

913
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.270
you know,
I gotta I gotta figure out another job.

914
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:35.610
So he started making paintings and selling his paintings.

915
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.520
It was the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.
Now he's a soup.

916
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.530
His name's Todd white.
He's just super successful artists.
He makes like this,
uh,

917
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:47.960
kind of Martini style cocktail was from the,
like,

918
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.010
like cocktail parties from the 1920s,

919
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.390
like those cool kind of cartoonish Martini glass things.

920
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.810
He's got a real specific,
distinctive style.
It's really cool.

921
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.480
He's a great artist and he's also a black belt in Jujitsu.

922
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:05.560
I know him from a John Joc Machado's.
He's a great guy,
but it was,
uh,

923
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.480
an opportunity for him to,

924
00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:11.430
to lose a job and even a job that he loved as an illustrator.
But,
you know,

925
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.300
I'm sure he'd much rather do what he wants to do and do what's going on in his

926
00:54:15.301 --> 00:54:17.730
mind and that's close to him.
Oh,
he's really cool.

927
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:21.870
He's bad ass and he's a great guy too.
Very cool guy.
Very.

928
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:25.200
He's a talented Jujitsu guy too.
Last time I rode with him,

929
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:29.880
he catch me in a number.
Let me like this.
Yeah,
he's very good.

930
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.710
All of this stuff is really cool.
It's,
it's,
uh,
it's very uniquely him.

931
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.720
<v 3>Do you ever go to like art galleries and he just have some wine and check out an</v>

932
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.030
art?
Never do any of that stuff.

933
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.050
<v 0>I'm losing patients with humans.</v>

934
00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:50.080
No,
I can't.
I have been our calories.
Sure.
Yeah.
There's,
um,

935
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.930
you know,
the,
I liked certain types of art.

936
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.730
I'm really into like sculptures I really liked.
Yeah.
I'm fascinated by that.

937
00:54:57.731 --> 00:55:00.460
Fascinating.
Really good sculptures and really good painting.

938
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.830
But I went to this art gallery that had like a lot of this like really?
Um,

939
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:10.360
what's the way you would put it?
I guess it's modern sort of abstract,

940
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.980
that Jackson Pollock type stuff and it was so ridiculously expensive.

941
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.770
It was like it was,
it was hurting my feelings.
I was,

942
00:55:17.771 --> 00:55:20.890
I was looking at these paintings like this is just some paint.
This is just,

943
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:24.400
you threw some paint around and now you want a shitload of money for this thing.

944
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:29.260
Like this is crazy.
I can't get into that.
I can't,
I just can't.

945
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.180
I get it.
I get this,
I get it.
Maybe like it would make a room look brighter.

946
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:38.980
Stick that in the corner.
I don't get it being worth $30,000.
I don't get that.

947
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:42.130
This doesn't make any sense to me.
I see what that is.

948
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:46.330
That's some paint that I could take my four year old and I could get her to do

949
00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:47.164
that.

950
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.380
<v 3>Yeah,
I don't,
I buy prints.
I believe in prints.</v>

951
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.050
Like there's like this whole thing where people look down on prince like,
Oh,

952
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:59.370
you're just printed it out.
But you know,
there's only whatever.

953
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.120
But,
uh,
I,
I love art and I just start recently got into it,

954
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:05.160
but I noticed that when looking at my walls,

955
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:10.250
I have a theme of like boobs and like course sexy women and stuff like that.

956
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.660
My uncle,
I don't know if I ever told,
he's my uncle growing up,
my aunt and uncle,

957
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:19.110
we'd go to his house for Christmas and there would be these crazy humongous

958
00:56:19.111 --> 00:56:24.100
paintings off.
Like they have a nice farm house,
really old school,
like family

959
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.170
<v 2>and then they would have these humongous paintings.</v>

960
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:30.250
I've just naked people or women naked women everywhere,
like,
Eh,

961
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.780
like discuss and they would have penthouses in the,
in the bathroom.
Oh yeah.

962
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:37.030
You told me about this family.
Yeah.
But it's like I'm turning into that.

963
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:40.550
That's so weird because you don't have kids.
Yeah.

964
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.380
If you have kids come over and that's how you're living or that's,

965
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:46.720
that's where it gets different.
You know,
you saw that when you were a kid,
right?

966
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:50.860
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And I would sit there and take like 15 poops.

967
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.600
No.
Well,
no,
no kid.
Yeah.
That's the deal.
It if they don't have kids.

968
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:57.230
So totally different environment.
Yeah.

969
00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.800
It's like they actually live like natural people.

970
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.690
People have kids up to hide everything.
So you're living like an actual man.

971
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.950
It's what like if men wanted to decorate their house and they didn't worry about

972
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:11.470
the repercussions of the design,
there'd be tits everywhere.

973
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:15.070
They're the only reason we're going to have tits all over our house is because

974
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:16.210
women would get mad at us.

975
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.870
But if you went over a guy's house and saw tits everywhere,
you're like,
oh,

976
00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:22.750
this guy is not going to stick with these not marrying me.

977
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:25.510
This is not going to work out.
We're not having a family together.

978
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.860
He's going to stick it in me.
And then another girl,

979
00:57:27.861 --> 00:57:31.150
and then he looked like this black tits over here and Chinese tits over there.

980
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.500
Like nobody wants that in the female kingdom.
They don't want that.

981
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:37.630
They'll start taking them down if they move in with you.

982
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:39.050
The first thing that's going as the tetes,

983
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.650
we got to take those tits down and was just too much.

984
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.080
We can replace them with my tests.
Like,
maybe you'll get that.

985
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.350
I always had that problem whenever I lived with a girl where you're like,
look,

986
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:49.970
we have to take down this poster of Terminator.
Oh,

987
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.080
we're putting up a basket and putting some,

988
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.790
and there's a lot of men who won't admit that they're changing because the woman

989
00:57:57.791 --> 00:57:59.350
wants them to behave differently.

990
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.350
And those guys become a real problem because they,

991
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.320
they start to justify their behavior is if it's correct,

992
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:09.250
they'll say things to you like,
you know,
why don't you just grow up,
man?
Like,

993
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:13.330
seriously?
I think it's about time.
You take the tits down off your wall.
I mean,

994
00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:18.010
fuck bro,
you're almost 40 all right.
Really?
Meanwhile,

995
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:21.010
they're miserable and you're smoking pot giggling,

996
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:25.180
watching Scifi films while they were arguing with your wife and your walls are

997
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:30.160
covered with tits.
So no one's wrong here.
Okay,
I hope you like your life.

998
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:32.500
And I,
you know,
and,
and what,
but you can't be,

999
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:35.830
you can't tell someone that the way they're living with tits on their wall is a

1000
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:40.720
bad way.
It's not.
It's just not your way.
But everybody doesn't want,

1001
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:42.040
they don't want options.

1002
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:44.880
They don't want you to have that option without being a loser.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1003
00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:47.350
You,
you're losing and I'm winning.

1004
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.280
Do you understand you with your tits on your wall,
you're almost fucking 40.

1005
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:55.720
Pull your pants up.
Loser.
You're,
they want you to be a loser.

1006
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:57.370
This one girl that I know,

1007
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:01.750
I went to her house and she noted she was in the industry and the industry.

1008
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:04.940
I love it how you said that.
She has a lot,
to me that's a movie.
Yeah.

1009
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.300
Which was important,
but she had this lot of artists,
friends that like,
you know,

1010
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:11.560
she was in like comic books and stuff like that where they're drawing,

1011
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:15.970
but she would have all these fans sent her,
send her like pictures of herself,

1012
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.590
like these humongous paintings.

1013
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:20.500
I've like her bending over like her butthole and it's like a humongous,

1014
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.980
and she's like,
I don't know,
I'm not

1015
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.610
<v 3>going to hang this up in my enough.
And so,
so she's like,
do you want this?</v>

1016
00:59:25.611 --> 00:59:26.600
And part of me was like,

1017
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.120
this would be the coolest thing in the whole entire road.
I would put this,

1018
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:32.600
you know,
like then I'm like,
wait,
no,
I can't have a yes,
she could be shit.

1019
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.950
If somebody I know bent over shit.
Got It.

1020
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:37.070
And should have put it right behind you while the show's plan.

1021
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.770
That would have been awesome.
How big is it?
Humongous.
Can you still get it?
No.

1022
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.340
If you stream would mind if we put a bandaid over the buddle a that'd be off.

1023
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.470
Just left it alone and just put a bad out over the butthole.
I should ask her.

1024
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.760
That would be hilarious.

1025
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:53.540
I had our show would probably lose a lot of credibility and some guests

1026
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:57.410
<v 0>wouldn't want to be on like a back when we had the flashlight as a sponsor.
Yeah.</v>

1027
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.090
There's a lot of guests that were like,
you know,

1028
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.770
we can't be associated with the flashlight.

1029
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.090
<v 3>Do you still have a box of those or did they oh yeah.
You have to throw them out.</v>

1030
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.010
No,
no,
I'm good.
I've got them.
Do you want one?
Yeah,
I need a couple of things.

1031
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.860
I think I have two or three lefts.
I keep coming over my house and stealing them.

1032
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.260
I just want a fresh one day I was going.
I definitely have,
yeah,

1033
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.220
<v 0>I definitely have some I,
yeah,
they sent me boxes of those things.</v>

1034
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.830
It's a,
it's a fascinating thing how people would negative,

1035
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:28.520
like they would have a negative feeling about the show because of that and the,

1036
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:33.200
one of the good things about having that as a sponsor is because no one can ever

1037
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:36.190
take you seriously.
You didn't have any of the,

1038
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.490
the responsibilities of someone who's like a serious journalist or if you're

1039
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:44.570
being sponsored by the flashlight,
you're immediately dismissed.
So it's good.

1040
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.800
It's good that way.
And anybody who comes on,
look,

1041
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.730
you've got to realize you're being sponsored by the flashlight.

1042
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.710
Didn't Sam Harris have a problem with that?

1043
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:56.300
Do we do like no sponsors on his podcast?
I think that's how we worked around.
Oh,

1044
01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:58.880
that's right.
Yeah.
I think he was.
Well,
I mean it makes sense.

1045
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.710
If the guy's like a serious intellectual,

1046
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.770
I think it's going to come hang out with us assholes,

1047
01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.230
toxify rubber pussies and all kinds of craziness.

1048
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.100
<v 3>Yeah.
Imagine having Ashley Madison as a sponsor.</v>

1049
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.790
That would be weird Karma right there.
Yeah.
That seems like

1050
01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.410
<v 0>if people want to go out and put together an illicit affair,</v>

1051
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.900
they don't need help.
You don't need a website,

1052
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.630
but you know I ain't hating.

1053
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.500
That's a Ashley Madison is an interesting one though.

1054
01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:29.830
It's like it shows the changing of the times and you can imagine if there were

1055
01:01:29.831 --> 01:01:34.390
anything like this existed in the 1980s or the 1990s it's like people are just

1056
01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:39.391
like opening up to so many weird and interesting new possibilities for how we

1057
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:40.360
interact with each other.

1058
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:44.320
I think that it's going to get real weird within the next 20 years.
Man.

1059
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:45.670
Real fucking weird.

1060
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:51.030
I think men and women are probably going to be able to do a lot of really weird

1061
01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:55.820
communication through a technology where you're going to have to,
you know,

1062
01:01:56.230 --> 01:02:00.850
have something that records either records experiences or can convey experiences

1063
01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.620
and you'd be able to sync up with each other.

1064
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:05.680
You'd be able to feel what it feels like when you go inside of her.

1065
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.890
<v 3>It's probably going to have something to do with like almost a good the next</v>

1066
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.370
after Google glasses when they finally get it inside your eyeball.
You know?

1067
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:15.940
And so you're,
it's,
it's reading your,
your thoughts and feelings.

1068
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.070
If you have a relationship,
you're like,
all right,

1069
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.880
I'm granting you access into my face.
You know what I mean?

1070
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:23.940
Like so she can feel and see everything you did that it's almost gonna be,

1071
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.770
that's gonna be the new marriage where like,
no,

1072
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.750
I could to know exactly what's going on cause I could actually write you,

1073
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:33.030
I'm on your database,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
does that make sense?

1074
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.600
<v 2>Totally makes sense.
And you could ask,
they could ask you if you want to pair,</v>

1075
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:41.630
you know,
should you allow Lydia to pair with you?
Right.
And you're like,
oh,

1076
01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:44.690
okay,
yes.
Yeah.
And then permanently it's like,

1077
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.300
that's an option prominently like you have to throw your database away if you

1078
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:49.980
want to get out of it or something like that.

1079
01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:52.950
I go to the apple store and they fucking do surgery on your head and you have to

1080
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:55.800
grant certain acts as like if there's whatever the doctor is now,
right.

1081
01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.930
<v 3>You'd have to grant like you get access to me,
to my body for the,
you know,</v>

1082
01:02:58.931 --> 01:03:02.590
to fix me.
Yeah.
And then some rogue doctor,
you know,

1083
01:03:02.591 --> 01:03:05.460
is it not going to take the access away or is it,

1084
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.720
we're going to hack it thinking to happen.

1085
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.490
<v 0>Tap in,
you're fucking dumb son.</v>

1086
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.820
<v 3>And then the government's gonna find a way to get into your database and be able</v>

1087
01:03:13.821 --> 01:03:16.310
to control you.
So where it's actually,
you're walking around,

1088
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:18.990
<v 0>well,
what's incredible is how close,</v>

1089
01:03:18.991 --> 01:03:23.760
at least in concept it is to the Matrix,
the movie,
the Matrix.

1090
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:25.830
When the dude had the big bolt in the back of his head,

1091
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:29.520
then he realized when he got unplugged that he had been locked up to that thing.

1092
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.890
That's,
I mean,
that idea is not farfetched.
Right?
It's just,

1093
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.873
it's not,

1094
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:40.860
it's they're going to be able to stimulate various aspects of the brain and

1095
01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:41.850
create memories.

1096
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:46.350
They're going to be able to introduce artificial memories that haven't been

1097
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:48.120
there before.
These are all like ideas.

1098
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:49.890
They're pretty sure they're gonna be able to pull off

1099
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.700
<v 2>demolition,
man.
You've seen the demolition man,
right?
That's all mood.
No,</v>

1100
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.660
I mean this the loan,
right?
Yeah.
This is the and Wesley Snipes,
right?
The sexting.

1101
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.660
This is a sex scene.
Yeah,
but in the future,
oh,

1102
01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:04.670
they were on opposite ends of the house or something like that.

1103
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:09.330
<v 4>I can't,
can't remember.
I think it's</v>

1104
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.850
<v 2>what happens here.
They put helmets on ballots on.
Yeah,
that's right.</v>

1105
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.930
Oh,
this is hilarious.
What year was this?

1106
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.270
I would say something like 95 or something like that.
We'll begin.
Woody says,

1107
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:28.500

like he doesn't.
He's like,
what the hell?

1108
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.340

1113
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.950
Can't believe with meeting in the middle of the universe.

1114
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.633
<v 5>Wow.</v>

1119
01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:18.510
That would be a nightmare.
That's not sexy.
Whoa.

1121

She goes,

1122
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.270
is that what you call this?
Yeah.

1123

That's what's been proven to produce higher orders of Alpha wave strain,

1124
01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:36.940
digitize transparency,
your sexual energies and obviously,
what do you say?

1125
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:38.590
We just do it the old fashioned way.

1126
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.170
Wow.
That sounds like a really well written movies.

1127
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:47.650
That's back when they hadn't figured that out yet.

1128
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.700
There's so many people that are just in love with that movie

1129
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.040
Dog Shit about my movie just because the one weird,
sexy.

1130
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.950
We're Sandra Bullock band man ever since she got in a new movie with helper.

The migrant built and breaking bad.

1132
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:04.970

1133
01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:10.300
That's bad ass Gilbert rules.
Do you watch that show?
No,

1134
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:14.410
I do not.

Yeah,

1135
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.610
but I haven't watched in a while.
It's one of those I got to catch up on it.

1136
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.150
Especially now that this is the last season.

1137
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:20.950
I'm just gonna Watch the whole thing.

I think of that.
They pump you full of testosterone.

1141
01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:35.470

1144
01:06:43.731 --> 01:06:47.200
I guess that he looks now,
he looks pretty charming.

1145
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:54.460
It's really interesting.

Incredibly interesting.
I mean it's pretty good.

1146
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.960

you hear about,

1147
01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:04.570
it's uh,

1157
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.200
I'm selling positive pregnancy tests.
Ever since I became pregnant.

1158
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.140
I have been asked numerous times for a positive test,

1159
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:53.050
so I decided to start charging for it.
Exclamation point.

1164

Pregnancy tests all day.
That's a business.

1166
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:23.780
She's got a basket full of them.
Just pass it on.

1167
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:25.790
I'm like crazy drinking giant jugs,

1168
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:30.820
Koolaid pissing all over these fucking things and then like two days before the

1169
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:35.951
wedding you had fake a miscarriage and then everyone buys you better toys and

1170
01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:39.560
presents gives you more money because they're so rude.
You're evil.

1171
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:44.090
I don't even think the most evil woman could think that way.
Actually.

1172
01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:47.090
They might write my time at holy.
Exactly right,
man.

1173
01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:51.200
I had somebody do a fake pregnancy with me once.
Remember that had shit.

1174
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:55.730
It's stupid.
Just so I would give her money.
Yeah.

1175
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.030
There's a lot of,
um,
these positive pregnancy tests,

1176
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.410
things where they're advertising these things and whether asking for them to

1177
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.840
just kind of weird man,

1178
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:10.750
I would buy just the smell them.

1179
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.930
How much is that?
$25 a smell.

1180
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:22.280
25 bucks just to smell some random chicks pis.
If you're a real freak,

1181
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.360
you might go for it.

1182
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1183
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:27.010
<v 2>I wonder if there's that.
You could sell that for 25 bucks.
Here's,</v>

1184
01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:28.190
send me a rag and I'll pee on it.

1185
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.350
It's not outside the realm of possibility.
It's crazy though.

1186
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:41.260
Manipulation.
It's just some people like that's their,

1187
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.410
their relationship was just a constant battle like that.

1188
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.253
It's,
uh,

1189
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:52.550
it's gotta be a weird way to enter into a lifelong commitment for fake pregnancy

1190
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:55.940
test.
I mean,
what if it all works out?
You happy you got married?

1191
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.700
Then one day sitting around,
she goes,
honey,

1192
01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:02.450
I'm gonna tell you something really funny.
I remember when I had that,
uh,

1193
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:07.340
that miscarriage.
I was never really pregnant.
I,
it was fake.
I needed,

1194
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.570
I knew you'd be happy eventually.
And so look,
I was right.

1195
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.520
Here we are 60 years later.
The guy's like,

1196
01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:20.930
she,
I don't care,
honey.
I love you.

1197
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.440
It's gotta be the responsibility of being the one who could possibly get

1198
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:26.390
pregnant.
Point is that fucking change the game.

1199
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.680
That's why they say that one of the biggest changes in behavior for human beings

1200
01:10:30.681 --> 01:10:34.850
was when birth control was invented because then for the first time women had

1201
01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:39.851
some sort of control over their own ability to get pregnant or not get pregnant,

1202
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:41.990
their own contraception.

1203
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.360
They didn't have to count on like I had to wear a rubber.

1204
01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:45.770
That guy doesn't want to wear a rubber.

1205
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:49.580
Otherwise I've got to get like an Iud or a diaphragm and those things fucking

1206
01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:52.040
slip out.
Especially if you have a thunderous,

1207
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:55.790
tremendous waterfall of loads slamming into that thing.

1208
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.360
They can't take a good shot.
You know,
they're good.

1209
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.430
They're good for like the average load,

1210
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.600
but you get like a wilt Chamberlain load there.
It just finds its way around.

1211
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.370
Hello.
Is that sucker sideways?

1212
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.030
Like one of those big revolving doors and Indiana Jones.

1213
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.710
That's what does the load hits.
It just

1214
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.293
<v 0>opens it up.</v>

1215
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:19.630
But that was a big change apparently for a women when they,

1216
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:23.640
they had like this new freedom,
like you think it's just fuck around.

1217
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.250
They didn't have to worry about,
some guy could just shoot one in there.

1218
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:30.450
Oh my God,
you almost got me pregnant psych.
We've enough to worry about it.

1219
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:34.290
I just can't believe that people still want to get married now days.

1220
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.560
I mean it just seems like now that you just know so many people that go in and

1221
01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:43.500
get married,
get divorced,
you know,
it's just like,
you know,

1222
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:47.760
more people that have been married then that are,
that are married at least.
Yeah.

1223
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:50.780
What you there,
there's always going to be,
um,

1224
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.800
a certain amount that are trying to talk you into it too,

1225
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:59.370
which is always weird.
Like you should just get married.
Hey man,

1226
01:11:59.371 --> 01:12:02.820
you should settle down.
Get married,
marry the girl.
Go ahead,
Marissa.

1227
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.620
You should marry her.
And you're like,
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
hey,
hey,
hey,
why?
Why,

1228
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.280
why to marry people want to drag other people into that fucking shell game.

1229
01:12:11.281 --> 01:12:13.470
It's like a call.
I never tell people to get married.

1230
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.140
People ask me to get married.
It,
you know,
if,
if,
uh,
they should get married.
I say,

1231
01:12:17.141 --> 01:12:21.900
listen,
I enjoy being married,
but it's rare.
It's rare that you do,

1232
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.070
you know,
me and the missus rug and get along great.
She's a sweetheart.

1233
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:28.740
She's a really nice person.
We enjoyed talking to each other.

1234
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:34.110
We enjoy raising children together.
We,
we love it.
But that shit's rare,
man.

1235
01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:37.110
It's really rare that people don't annoyed.
They'll fuck out of each other.

1236
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:41.550
After a while,
the grill apart,
they start getting annoyed with each other.

1237
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:45.270
They're around each other all the time and then the dark shit happens when you

1238
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:48.810
start breaking up and people start getting mercenary about where the money goes.

1239
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.260
People start getting mercenary about the house and it starts becoming a

1240
01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:55.260
competition.
I've seen it happen too many times.
I've just,

1241
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:57.600
I've seen it happen way too many times.

1242
01:12:57.601 --> 01:13:00.350
For me to think that it's a good idea to get married because the,
the,

1243
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.620
the ending of relationships when people just break up aren't nearly as bad.

1244
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:09.780
But the consequences of divorce or just fucking devastating breakup suck.

1245
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.910
Nobody likes breaking up.
Nobody likes being depressed.

1246
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.070
Nobody likes missing somebody sucks period.

1247
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.950
But divorce is break up times a hundred,

1248
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:21.590
maybe more where you become 100% enemies.
Yeah.

1249
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.300
Like war.
Yeah.

1250
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:27.120
People go to war man and it gets ugly and you know,

1251
01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:31.440
they legally have to still be engaged in this thing you're brought into the

1252
01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:31.860
court.

1253
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.250
It's like once you get into that court system and you're divvying everything up

1254
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:38.490
inside the court system,
you have to be in their world.

1255
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.510
You have to be engaging with the men and women both,
you know,

1256
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:43.770
I'm sure like it equally,

1257
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:47.160
both are equally guilty of wanting the person who wants to leave them to be

1258
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:51.300
forced to pay or it's craziness,
man.
It's madness.

1259
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.780
The only time it makes sense is to me when there's children involved and when

1260
01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:57.480
the woman has to um,
you know,

1261
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.480
it takes a lot of time to raise children.

1262
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.800
It takes a tremendous amount of time to be pregnant and give birth to actually

1263
01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:09.510
raise the child.
And a woman should be compensated for that.
I think,

1264
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.320
you know,
if you,

1265
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.660
if you choose to not work at stay home and you're raising children,

1266
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:18.070
there's a big difference between that and a couple that don't have any kids that

1267
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:18.940
are in a relationship,

1268
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:22.030
that breakup and the woman gets smarter scenario because I've seen that too and

1269
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:25.390
that is so much grocer.
That is the grossest shit ever.

1270
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:29.680
When you see a couple and they're just a,
you know,

1271
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:32.680
a man and a woman and they don't have any kids together and they decided to get

1272
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:35.320
married and during the time that they're together and they're in love,

1273
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.610
they both work and they,
they split income and then when they go to get divorced,

1274
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:43.510
the mercenary shit that takes place,
the fighting over the house,

1275
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:48.511
the fucking calling the IRS on someone and pretending they owe more money than

1276
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:51.190
they do,
sending an anonymous letters about them.

1277
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.390
Like all that kind of craziness starts happening and people become enemies with

1278
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:58.780
each other in a way that doesn't exist in any other kind of relationship.

1279
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.260
It's very rare that friends ever do that to each other.
You know?

1280
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.220
Like how often do you hear about a friend like suing another friend,

1281
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:10.480
taking a friend to court?
It's pretty rare,
but it almost happens.

1282
01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.380
It least half of the cases where people decide to get married.

1283
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.640
At least half the people I know the decided to do that legal contract thing,

1284
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:23.680
wind up falling apart at least half and when it gets to half it's got to be like

1285
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:28.620
Jesus,
what a crap shoot are you involved in?
Right.
The only time,

1286
01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:31.810
the only time it makes sense to me is raising children and even then it doesn't

1287
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:34.660
make sense.
It makes sense that a woman would want it and that they,

1288
01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:39.100
they like being able to say it and then like the different classification that

1289
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:43.990
they feel.
It gives the relationship,
but it's a nutty,

1290
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:48.400
nutty way to live tied into this legal system.
The legal system.

1291
01:15:48.401 --> 01:15:50.980
You should avoid that motherfucker if at all possible.

1292
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.300
Whenever you can avoid being involved in the world of lawyers and paying for

1293
01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:59.140
lawyers and going to court Jesus Christ,
avoid that.
Avoid it.

1294
01:15:59.141 --> 01:16:03.640
If you can absolutely avoided if you had you take your shit,
I'll take my shit.

1295
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.370
Well that's how you're rocking it.
That's how you're rocking it right now.

1296
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:09.330
But then you know there's also the,
you get lonely.
You want them,

1297
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.620
you want to know someone like truly and intimately.

1298
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:13.210
And that takes a long time to do,

1299
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.750
to really understand someone cause people like they pretend to be something that

1300
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:21.340
they're not and they put on behavior that is like a acceptable,

1301
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:22.570
the beginning,
you know,

1302
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:25.060
because you think they're really unique and then as you get to know them,

1303
01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:26.650
you find out it's kind of a bullshit act.

1304
01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:31.390
It takes a long time to figure out who's real and who's not and who you really

1305
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:34.930
enjoy hanging out with and talking to.
And you don't get that.

1306
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:38.200
And those fly by night girl just moves in and moves out.
Two months later,

1307
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:43.000
relationships,
you get chaos and eggs thrown at your house and tee shirts stolen.

1308
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:46.630
You get,
you get craziness man.
And that's what you're going to get.

1309
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:49.420
And that sort of a relationship.
So that's the,
that's the rub.

1310
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.440
It's like what do you want?

1311
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:53.080
Do you want to get the possibility of being annoyed with each other?

1312
01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:56.140
And constant fights,
which we've all seen,
we've all seen it.

1313
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.160
We've all seen the legal entanglements that involve when you break up or do you

1314
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:01.930
want to have these fly by night,

1315
01:17:01.931 --> 01:17:05.290
20 year old crazy bitches coming in and out of your life.

1316
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:10.100
You don't seem to be enjoying it either.
You see that

1317
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.830
<v 3>doesn't seem to be like the best option either.
You know,</v>

1318
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.690
everybody wants to be able to James Bond it.

1319
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:19.070
You've known me and PR a lot of relationships as long relationships.

1320
01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.640
I have always been one of those people that just likes it.

1321
01:17:22.641 --> 01:17:25.070
I think it's comfortable,
you know like having somebody,

1322
01:17:25.071 --> 01:17:28.580
even if you know you're not cited or anything like that,

1323
01:17:28.581 --> 01:17:32.630
it's just nice to have like somebody with you all the time,
like a a partner.

1324
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:34.820
Like you can go home to you know and stuff.

1325
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:38.720
But I haven't done that for a while though.

1326
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.820
Have that somebody or done that.
I kind of miss it though.
It's,

1327
01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.010
it's a nice feeling if it goes bad,

1328
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:47.450
<v 0>I've seen it go bad with you.
It's,
yeah,
it's ugly.</v>

1329
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:50.500
It's devastating for your emotional health.
Doesn't feel good.
Yeah,

1330
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.340
it's a real problem when you know,

1331
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:55.400
you get really close to somebody and then you start hating each other.
That's a,

1332
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:59.060
that has a real physical effect on you.
You know,
I've,

1333
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:03.540
I've had like the worst shows of my life after breakups,
you know,
the,

1334
01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:07.340
the worst shows ever.
Cause it's like you just don't feel funny at all.

1335
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.450
He just feel like I'll fucking loser.
I can some of the worst sets I had.

1336
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:15.890
Like when I moved from New York,
uh,
to bought from Boston rather to New York,

1337
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:20.780
I was breaking up with his chick that I had dated in Boston and she really was

1338
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:22.880
done with me before I was really done with her.

1339
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:27.440
So it was like extra ego bruise and um,
and I just decided,

1340
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:32.280
you know,
to,
to get the fuck out of dodge and move to a New Jersey.
Um,

1341
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:35.090
and uh,
the,
uh,

1342
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.080
going on stage was so hard cause I was,
nothing was funny to me.

1343
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:43.500
I was just like emotional,
sad case.
I wasn't like,
I didn't,

1344
01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.560
I didn't understand how to embrace things.

1345
01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:48.290
I didn't understand how to embrace the adventure of like,

1346
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.550
now I'm going to be doing standup in New York and you know,
Holy Shit,
I'm here.

1347
01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:55.790
I moved down,
I'm staying at my grandparents' house in New Jersey.

1348
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.960
I was just a terrible mess.
Like terrified about the future.

1349
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.930
Bummed out that this girl doesn't want to be with me anymore.

1350
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:08.120
And My sets were terrible because of that for like a while,

1351
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:11.750
like a couple of weeks.
It took me a while,
like sort of get it together,

1352
01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:12.710
I get loose again.

1353
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.710
That's indicative of like there's an emotional state that breakups put you in.

1354
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.440
It's unhealthy.
Yeah.

1355
01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:24.750
<v 3>Yeah.
Especially when I remember my big one when I first moved out here,</v>

1356
01:19:24.751 --> 01:19:29.751
I mean I did it for like seven years and I went on complete sadness that,

1357
01:19:30.871 --> 01:19:33.420
you know,
like if this is the worst thing in the world for like a month,

1358
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.690
then I went revenge,
I'm going to lose a shitload of weight.

1359
01:19:36.691 --> 01:19:41.170
And that's when I lost all that weight.
Remember that like,
and it was,
it,

1360
01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:45.960
it was so,
I mean,
that lasted a year,
a year of my life probably,
you know,

1361
01:19:45.961 --> 01:19:49.110
when it said to done,
I was still like,
what is she doing?
Oh my God,
where's your,

1362
01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.420
where's yet?
You know,
it's so weird how,

1363
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.260
how much connection you get with somebody and then when that's gone it's like

1364
01:19:55.261 --> 01:19:58.860
they kind of died.
Like you went from being like,
this is my partner in life.

1365
01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:03.510
Too Low.
That person exists though.
Like she's breathing right now.
She's,

1366
01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:07.440
<v 0>yeah.
Do you ever stop and think about like high school girlfriends?
Oh yeah.</v>

1367
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.333
That's real weird.
Yeah.

1368
01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.730
<v 3>I just talked to one the other day.
Did you really?
Yeah,
she's,</v>

1369
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:12.680
she has daughters now and everything like that.

1370
01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:16.850
This is the one that I dated in high school that cheated on me with my best

1371
01:20:16.851 --> 01:20:21.560
friend.
And the day of graduation,
she sat with her family,

1372
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:25.640
his family.
So my dad's like,
it where's so and so?
And that was like,

1373
01:20:25.641 --> 01:20:27.220
she's over there with Lira,

1374
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.410
<v 0>ted,
Ted parents.</v>

1375
01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.330
<v 3>But,
uh,
she,
she's like,
do you have all those pictures?
I mean,</v>

1376
01:20:34.331 --> 01:20:37.390
I used to have tons of photos of me and her and he was like,
yeah,

1377
01:20:37.391 --> 01:20:39.760
I actually have a on my flicker.
And so she uh,

1378
01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.300
she wanted me to like print them out or send her links so she could print it out

1379
01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:46.870
and look,
show her kids like,
oh,
this is what,
how mommy used to be,
you know.

1380
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.450
<v 0>But it's weird talking to that unit.
That was years ago.</v>

1381
01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.320
It's weird talking to anybody that you knew from back then that you were friends

1382
01:20:56.321 --> 01:21:00.130
with.
But it's really weird.
When I was a girl,
the girl used to date

1383
01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.830
is that weird thing.
Strange feeling.

1384
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.750
You still fuck each other and now here we are 20 years later.

1385
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:14.760
Yeah.
Saying shut up kids,
quiet.
Mommy's on the phone with Brian.

1386
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.400
It's not the same person either.
It almost feels like it's a different person.

1387
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:19.510
Of course it is a different person.

1388
01:21:19.511 --> 01:21:22.990
You're a different person than when I met you.
Everybody's different,
you know,

1389
01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.250
if you keep evolving,

1390
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:27.100
you eventually not the same thing that you were just a year ago.

1391
01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:28.630
You're not the same thing you were a week ago.

1392
01:21:28.631 --> 01:21:31.570
If you have conviction and mean who are you?
You're,

1393
01:21:31.571 --> 01:21:33.460
you are what you decided you are right now.

1394
01:21:33.490 --> 01:21:35.170
It's whether or not you can maintain that.

1395
01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.250
You know whether or not you can maintain what you would like to be.

1396
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.700
But for a lot of people you're barely the same thing every year.

1397
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.750
Every year you're developing sort of new ideas about things,

1398
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:50.200
understanding your faults a little bit better,

1399
01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.020
understanding where you fuck up a little bit better and trying not to do it.

1400
01:21:53.021 --> 01:21:54.910
Being a little bit more disciplined about certain things,

1401
01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:57.340
we feel like you've been lacking.
If that happens,

1402
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.650
how you're not the same thing you were a year ago,

1403
01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.860
you're not the same thing you were five years ago.
You're not,
you change,

1404
01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:04.000
you're not,
I'm not,

1405
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.440
I don't believe half the things that I believed 10 15 years ago.

1406
01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:10.630
I look at things totally differently.

1407
01:22:10.631 --> 01:22:13.520
Like we were talking about the Hugh Hefner joke now,

1408
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:14.740
like I wouldn't do that joke today.

1409
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.290
I wouldn't pick on one guy like that for no reason.

1410
01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:20.170
Just cause he's banging some checks.
I would,
I would do it in a different way.

1411
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:21.820
I would do it way less mean.

1412
01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:27.050
He's still durable to captain's hat on as level little blankies and swell.

1413
01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.330
It's the,
here's he was my,

1414
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:34.210
my beef with it and it'll always be this is that he's a pornographer and no one

1415
01:22:34.211 --> 01:22:37.720
wants to admit that is for some reason it's like the socially accepted

1416
01:22:37.721 --> 01:22:42.010
pornography.
You know,
and I don't think there's anything wrong with pornography,

1417
01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:46.480
but I think it's weird that we pretend that if you don't show the vagina that

1418
01:22:46.481 --> 01:22:50.590
it's somehow another acceptable well and the difference between that and when

1419
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:51.760
you see like crystal clear,

1420
01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:55.090
like hustlers stuff where they're opening their pussy,
that's nasty.

1421
01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:58.810
Like to who was this for women is just stuff for women because it's not nasty

1422
01:22:58.811 --> 01:23:02.530
for me.
Like what's going on?
And the idea is that playboy has kind of classy.

1423
01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:07.210
<v 3>It's all about the photography.
It's almost like the of a woman compared to like,</v>

1424
01:23:07.211 --> 01:23:12.190
hey my pussy fat Holly's listened to you.
You convert.

1425
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:16.690
It's all about the a to the woman he has.

1426
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.230
That's the type of shit,
the photographer for those girls.

1427
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:23.590
If photography is where playboy are fucking legit photographer and these people

1428
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:26.700
are like best,
best,
like for anyone who,
was there anything,

1429
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:29.850
she does a lot of stuff for playboy penthouse though.
I mean you're,

1430
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.840
you're getting a combination or hustler.

1431
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:35.350
You're getting a combination of good photographers and just guys that not had

1432
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:36.190
that have cameras.

1433
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.210
<v 0>I,
yeah,
the,
see that's what I say.
I don't need a lot of um,</v>

1434
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.920
photography skills when it comes to like looking at naked checks.

1435
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.310
They have to be clear.
That's a clear picture.
We're good.

1436
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.290
<v 3>I don't know.
You look at somebody like Holly,
Holly Randall is,
I think,
well,</v>

1437
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:55.210
there's definitely a different feeling

1438
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.270
<v 0>is definitely a different feeling to watching something or looking at a magazine</v>

1439
01:24:00.271 --> 01:24:04.650
where girls are like pissing in each other's mouths and spreading their assholes

1440
01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.400
open.

1441
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.400
And a girl who's just posing with her mouth slightly agape arching her back hand

1442
01:24:12.211 --> 01:24:14.490
and her from ass.
That is different.

1443
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.170
<v 3>Yeah.
Checkout a Holly Randall Dotcom sometimes.</v>

1444
01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:21.230
She's one of my favorite female photographers for erotic.

1445
01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.890
She does a lot of shit for penthouse though.
But uh,
amazing photographer.

1446
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:29.100
<v 0>Very nice woman to,
um,
I just think that it's,
it's,</v>

1447
01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.170
it's just weird that people decide what,

1448
01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.860
what is and what's not acceptable when it comes to pornography.

1449
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.980
And it has to do with actually seeing things.

1450
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.440
Like we'd like seeing the vagina itself.

1451
01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:43.330
Like you don't think vaginas are beautiful.

1452
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.300
Do you think that somehow or another that the woman's body is beautiful,

1453
01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:49.780
her breasts are beautiful but the vagina is a little much you,

1454
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:54.420
you are in fact wrong.
Okay.
Because vaginas are beautiful ceremony them,

1455
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.710
they're delicious,
they look great,

1456
01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:00.850
they look great unless there's a problem with it and you know,
look,

1457
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:04.510
it is what it is.
I mean it's not saying that every vagina has to look awesome.

1458
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.680
Well we are saying though,

1459
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.520
if you take photos of them should probably limit those photos to the ones that

1460
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.380
looked pretty good.
But that's just like,

1461
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:13.750
unless you want it to be like a character pace,

1462
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.230
<v 3>if you go on some of these cam websites and you start,
you start singing</v>

1463
01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:21.260
and I tell you,
man,
if you like on,

1464
01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:24.400
on Myfreecams and you could choose South Africa,

1465
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:27.340
there's usually like four girls on there.
I mean,

1466
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:30.610
there was this one girl had her vagina really looked unhealthy.

1467
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.750
That's not pretty sure.

1468
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:39.100
<v 0>So John Mccain was playing poker on his iPhone while,</v>

1469
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:42.680
uh,
his colleagues were discussing bombing Syria.

1470
01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.320
They have a photograph of him.

1471
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:50.050
He's sitting there with his iPhone and he's playing poker.
That's hilarious.

1472
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:51.620
It's fucking hilarious,
dude.

1473
01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.570
<v 3>Aviva,
you've been following all of this,
right?</v>

1474
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:57.100
You saw all the gas videos where all these people are getting gassed on,

1475
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.580
I think it was Ustream stream or something like that.

1476
01:25:58.581 --> 01:26:02.970
Somebody was broadcasting it live and people were dying.
Did A,

1477
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.770
uh,
have you been paying attention to,
I don't know much,

1478
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:09.890
but did they ever find out who gas?

1479
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:13.790
Was it the government gassing neurone people or was it like,
uh,
some debts,

1480
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.050
death squads or something?
Right.

1481
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:20.050
<v 0>I do not know exactly who,
uh,
who did it.
I know that somebody took,</v>

1482
01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:23.920
we should probably Google that because someone took credit for it.

1483
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.360
<v 3>Wow.
That's hilarious.
He does.
But I mean,
where's this coming from?
Yes.</v>

1484
01:26:28.361 --> 01:26:32.050
This is when you're playing poker on his iPhone hero.
Wow.

1485
01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.880
That's hilarious.
Uh,

1486
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:41.920
credit for it.
But you know what?
He's so old that maybe he was just like,
ah,

1487
01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.700
what do I get?
Deron email up.
What?

1488
01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.410
I'm trying to like what if he accidentally hit,
you know,
the poker,

1489
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:52.010
you know what I mean?
Like he's playing though.
Oh that motherfuckers locked in.

1490
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.080
It's like a still photo.
What's happening?
Good time.

1491
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:56.570
He knows what he wants to do and wants to play poker.

1492
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:59.430
He doesn't want to talk about Syria.
He's been saying let's fucking bomb.

1493
01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:04.640
And then it goes right back on another ice SWOT.
Full House bitches.
Look at that.

1494
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.300
Eh,
I wouldn't even wait.
I would like to see,
as you know,

1495
01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:10.810
if it was him just staring at his phone out,
what does it do?
And like,

1496
01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:14.480
it's too old to figure out,
like where does it have my email?
Like,
you know,

1497
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:16.070
old people with technology

1498
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:21.090
<v 0>who did this.
So I'm still see,
right.
Yeah.</v>

1499
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:25.670
Responsibility.

1500
01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:31.450
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1501
01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:33.280
<v 0>I guess it,
the Syrian rebels,</v>

1502
01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.550
I don't know.
There's all sorts of uh,
terrible shit going on over there.

1503
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:44.800
This is a,
the same conflict where the guy who,
uh,
was from the,

1504
01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.940
the people that were backing eight,
the,

1505
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:51.800
the a piece of the man's heart cut out of his chest and ate a chunk of his
heart.

1506
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:55.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Who's side are we on?

1507
01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:57.830
We're on that guy side.

1508
01:27:58.010 --> 01:28:00.540
<v 3>It kind of sucks though,
because I,
you know,
if we do anything with Syria,</v>

1509
01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:05.540
I mean then are we going to get in war with Russia again?
Oh,

1510
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.500
I don't know.
Cause Russian has like their last base.

1511
01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:10.890
They're like they're big.

1512
01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:12.350
<v 0>Yeah.
Dot.
C.
Dot.</v>

1513
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.590
Who the fuck knows what's really going on behind the scenes in any of these

1514
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:20.390
things,
you know,
you know,
I shouldn't say you know anymore.
You know that.

1515
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.090
Yeah.
Cause it's another way of saying,
um

1516
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.880
<v 4>hm.</v>

1517
01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.070
<v 0>The uh,
documentary that we always talk about or the,</v>

1518
01:28:28.071 --> 01:28:31.930
the paper rather that Smedley Butler war is a racket.

1519
01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.330
It's a guy who lived in the 1930s.

1520
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:41.490
It was a war is a racket,
but naked.

1521
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.620
And uh,
he,
um,

1522
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:44.960
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1523
01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.670
<v 0>he wrote this thing in 1935.
It's so crazy because if you're read it today,</v>

1524
01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:52.520
it's so poignant.
It's hard to believe really

1525
01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.793
<v 4>that,
uh,</v>

1526
01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.600
<v 0>that it was actually so long ago they wrote this,</v>

1527
01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:01.980
it was a speech and then a booklet that he put out,

1528
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.920
<v 2>it's 51 pages and uh,</v>

1529
01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:09.150
it was published in 1935 by round table press.
And,
uh,

1530
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.250
the booklet was also a condensed and do a reader's digest as a book supplement.

1531
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:20.040
And it's,
it's,
it's really an impossible message today because if you,

1532
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:25.200
it's,
it's,
it's so strange that this was actually published in a book in 1935.

1533
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.970
It's impossible for us to believe rather than this was the message and it's,

1534
01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:32.940
war is a racket.
It's always been,
it's possibly the oldest,

1535
01:29:32.941 --> 01:29:34.200
easily the most profitable.

1536
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:38.070
Surely the most vicious is the only one international in scope.

1537
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.490
It's the only one in which profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in

1538
01:29:41.491 --> 01:29:44.820
lives.
And this is,
it's a long thing.
And I want to read anymore of it,

1539
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:49.440
but it's fucking brilliant.
And this is a guy that was a major military figure.

1540
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.660
He was the United States Marine Corps.

1541
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:54.660
Major General two time medal of honor recipient.

1542
01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.440
That's pretty crazy.
So when you,
you know,
when you look at that,

1543
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:01.910
that was 1935 and you think,
well,

1544
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:04.160
what has been done about stopping that type of behavior?

1545
01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.160
Abso-Fucking-Lutely nothing.
Not only that,

1546
01:30:07.161 --> 01:30:09.050
it's evolved because everything evolves.

1547
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:12.890
It's not like they've cleaned the house and taking all the people out that were

1548
01:30:12.891 --> 01:30:17.891
involved in this type of behavior and educated them on ethics and morals and

1549
01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.380
humanity and being kind to be evil.
Get the fuck Outta here,
bitch.

1550
01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.060
They're just better at hiding it.

1551
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:26.420
Better at making money at it and just better at it,

1552
01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:30.740
period from whatever this was,
which was almost a hundred years ago now,

1553
01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:33.140
which is really crazy.
And it was 80 fucking years ago.

1554
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.400
That's God damn,
that's so long ago.

1555
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:42.410
Just wrap your head around that 1935 date.

1556
01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:48.950
That's incredible.
80 fucking years ago.

1557
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:51.570
Almost wrap your head around that.

1558
01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.600
Just think about these people live in back then and this guy comes out with his

1559
01:30:56.601 --> 01:30:58.790
book there,
you know,
World War One.

1560
01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.550
He comes out with his book before World War II.
It was like,

1561
01:31:01.551 --> 01:31:04.790
this is just bullshit.
Like they're just going over there to say bankers.

1562
01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:08.030
They're just going over here to make it safe for the oil companies.

1563
01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:11.480
There's going over here and they're pretending that they're the fucking saving

1564
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:13.340
the world.
When you read that,

1565
01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.840
there's no reason to believe that anything has changed,

1566
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:21.560
so when you see the serious shit,
you got to go,
I don't know,
man.

1567
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:26.840
All I know is Ron Paul's not buying it.
GRANDPA's not Ron.

1568
01:31:26.841 --> 01:31:30.380
Paul thinks it's some,
he thinks that that would be ridiculous to a attack.

1569
01:31:30.381 --> 01:31:32.270
Those people with gas like that,

1570
01:31:32.271 --> 01:31:34.320
he thinks it's somebody who wants to drag us into ward.

1571
01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:38.750
Did that because that would be the reason why people would be willing to accept

1572
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:39.643
another war.

1573
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:44.390
It would take something along those lines and to make it so big and so public.

1574
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:46.790
He said,
why would they do that?
You know?
He said,

1575
01:31:46.791 --> 01:31:48.230
I believe that it's a false flag.

1576
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:53.060
When you hear a guy like Ron Paul say something like that.
I mean,
who would know?

1577
01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.510
You know,
I think Ron Paul might know.

1578
01:31:58.110 --> 01:31:58.943
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1579
01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:01.690
<v 3>Goddammit Brian.
Now you got me scared.</v>

1580
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:06.730
Did you see that video of that boulder falling down?
Yes.
Yeah.

1581
01:32:06.731 --> 01:32:10.270
Life is fucking terrifying.
That's ridiculous.
Where was this?

1582
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.750
It looks like something.
Yeah.
So yeah,
but this kind of reminds me of like,

1583
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.510
you know where you're driving in Malibu,
you know you've driven that road.
Uh,

1584
01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.740
and I guess you can see it like fall loose from the mountain right before it

1585
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:25.550
suddenly

1586
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:27.710
<v 2>waterfall just starts or something.
Well,</v>

1587
01:32:27.711 --> 01:32:31.190
it absolutely can happen in Malibu and it does look at that.

1588
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:32.810
Oh Jesus Christ.

1589
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.870
<v 3>Oh my God.
Look at this big fucking,
oh,
you almost died.</v>

1590
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.040
That is incredible.
That's so loony tunes.

1591
01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:44.280
<v 2>It's so big.
And then he hit their hazards.</v>

1592
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:49.120
So polite Japanese [inaudible] Japanese people.
If that was a,

1593
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:53.850
an American,
they'd be going,
fuck gun CIF fucking fucking cunt.
Wow.

1594
01:32:53.851 --> 01:32:55.940
This is crazy.
Boom.

1595
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.770
And that could happen any day that got Malbec.
Look at that.

1596
01:32:59.771 --> 01:33:03.780
That car almost got smushed.
Well,

1597
01:33:03.781 --> 01:33:06.750
Malibu Canyon has been closed several times since I've lived here.

1598
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:11.340
I thought about living in Malibu before.
Malibu's fucking beautiful man.

1599
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.260
You're out there on the mountain overlooking the ocean.
It's so beautiful.

1600
01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:17.490
And the people there are chill.

1601
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:20.670
There's something about being like right by the water.

1602
01:33:20.671 --> 01:33:24.780
I think that does something to a person.
All beach communities are chill,

1603
01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.590
you know,
they like to have fun,
relax.

1604
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:31.770
It feels like a born more enjoy life type of vibe.

1605
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.680
I would love to do it.
But the problem Malibu is,

1606
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:37.290
it's a bunch of crazy rich people popping pills.
They're

1607
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:40.230
bringing their dog everywhere.

1608
01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:44.940
Like they'll bring the dog in a restaurants and shit and like kids in Mal.

1609
01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:47.700
But like if you want to raise your kids there,
that Malibu high,

1610
01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.300
apparently I hear,
uh,
there's uh,
they have,
uh,

1611
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.690
a few behavioral problems there with some of the substances while you shit

1612
01:33:54.691 --> 01:33:56.100
homeschool your kids Joe

1613
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.750
<v 3>podcast and they'll learn every day,
you know,
just start off and like,
you know,</v>

1614
01:34:00.751 --> 01:34:04.110
maybe an eight or seven and just bring them to the podcast every day.

1615
01:34:04.111 --> 01:34:05.240
There'll be smarter than anybody else.

1616
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:08.150
<v 2>Well,
what's a,
a better idea is,
uh,</v>

1617
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:11.180
show them some oxycontin documentary very early in life.

1618
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:14.330
Show them the oxycontin express and say,
look,

1619
01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.780
this is some shit you want to avoid and you're not even going to believe it's

1620
01:34:17.781 --> 01:34:20.060
possible until you see someone smoking it in front of you.

1621
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:22.810
You're not going to believe like,
no,
there's no one's stupid enough to smokes.

1622
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:24.170
I oxycontin at a party.

1623
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.990
Oh yes there is and you're probably going to run into him.

1624
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.360
I ran into people doing coke at parties.

1625
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:33.380
I ran into a course run into people smoking pot.

1626
01:34:33.381 --> 01:34:35.840
I've ran into people eating mushrooms.

1627
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:37.940
I've ran into people dropping acid at parties.

1628
01:34:37.941 --> 01:34:41.960
I ran into like basically almost anything except math at parties.

1629
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.750
I probably ran into people on math.
I just didn't know they were out of math.

1630
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:49.700
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
But that's the key.
You got to let them know,

1631
01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:53.480
like bring him around.
People that are fucked up,
let them know like this is real.

1632
01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:56.930
Like you gotta listen to me because this really can take over your life.

1633
01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:57.980
There's really can grab

1634
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.420
<v 0>a hold of you and drag you right into a chemical hell that you can't get out of.</v>

1635
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:07.930
There is some shit that you can do that you can't undo you fucking cigarettes,

1636
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:09.590
man.
You bummed me out dude.

1637
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.250
I would hate to see you die like that cause it's going to happen.

1638
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:15.500
If you keep going.
It's going to be,
there's a moment,

1639
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.920
whether it's 10 years from now or 20 years from now and you're one of these put

1640
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:22.520
it off guys like,
oh do all quit before that.
I'll quit before that.

1641
01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:26.030
But you're taking like giant chunks off the end of your life.

1642
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:30.290
You're taking giant chunks off your health giant chunks of your ability for your

1643
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:33.830
lungs to function correctly and it's just because you're stuck.

1644
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.060
You're in this chemical,
this chemical web that you just can't get out of.

1645
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:43.830
<v 3>Yeah,
it's,
it's pretty amazing.
It's pretty amazing.</v>

1646
01:35:43.831 --> 01:35:45.340
What does electronic cigarettes though,
man,

1647
01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.220
so many people are fucking smoking those things.
Joey d is less than though.

1648
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:52.680
The worst though is those ain't shit.
Ain't shit.

1649
01:35:52.681 --> 01:35:56.490
I don't even want a regular cigarette dog.
This is just vapor.
Is it,

1650
01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.030
what is the deal though?
We,
we,
we've been disputed about that.

1651
01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:05.200
We said that a tobacco companies own those things.
Yeah.

1652
01:36:05.201 --> 01:36:07.230
So apparently it is true.
Maybe,

1653
01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:10.800
but most tobacco companies apparently trying to lobby against them because

1654
01:36:10.801 --> 01:36:13.860
they're hurting cigarette sales.
Yeah.
But uh,
what'd I say?

1655
01:36:13.861 --> 01:36:17.430
The second largest one owns blue or whatever it was.

1656
01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:21.150
I mean the other ones like get the fuck outta here with that.
Yeah.

1657
01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:25.270
It's probably an old guy that owns like a company versus a new,
you know,

1658
01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:29.070
somebody who died from lung cancer in the sun just got the company.
I was like,

1659
01:36:29.071 --> 01:36:31.710
no,
we're investing in these robots.
Cigarettes with the lights.

1660
01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.060
Apparently the cost effectiveness is an issue as well.
Like those uh,

1661
01:36:36.061 --> 01:36:40.020
those things they last for like a long time.
Like a blue one of those cigarettes.

1662
01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.130
Rechargeable.
Yeah,

1663
01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.160
the rechargeable and the amount of a cigarette in them like is good for a long,

1664
01:36:46.201 --> 01:36:48.650
it's like two packs of cigarettes,
usually some of these.

1665
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:53.250
And now you get those humongous hookah ones where it's pretty much like,
like a,

1666
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:56.220
like a s a two liter of that juice.

1667
01:36:56.490 --> 01:36:59.280
And you just see these people sucking on it all day.
Just smoke.

1668
01:36:59.281 --> 01:37:03.480
Just nonstop coming out of their mouth.
Bobby Lee?
Yeah.
Bobby Lee.
Pj on.

1669
01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:08.300
If you remember PTA.
Bobby Lee has one that's as big as a thermos.
Yes.

1670
01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.310
What PJ?
It's insane and he just sucks on that thing all the time.

1671
01:37:11.311 --> 01:37:15.480
He's got stickers all over it.
Bobby has stickers all over the,

1672
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.800
the new candy cigarette man.

1673
01:37:16.801 --> 01:37:21.450
The kids want them because they look cool because of the lights fucking instead.

1674
01:37:21.451 --> 01:37:24.210
It's just another way to get people addicted to fucking cigarettes or putting

1675
01:37:24.211 --> 01:37:25.260
things in their mouth.

1676
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:29.700
<v 0>Yeah.
Well it's also just a nicotine distribution device.
When we,</v>

1677
01:37:29.701 --> 01:37:32.340
when Marin was in here and we saw him eating that,
that gum,

1678
01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.200
he eats that gum all day long.
That nicorette.
Right.
I guess that's okay though.

1679
01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.620
They say that the Nicorette gum actually is good if your writing,

1680
01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.120
we try that Nicorette Gum.

1681
01:37:42.121 --> 01:37:45.630
It's actually stimulating for like a your synapses and shit.

1682
01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.780
<v 3>It's disgusting.
Is it?
Yeah,
it,
it tastes like you're eating chemicals.</v>

1683
01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:53.680
Marin ain't got no problem with it.
He loves that Shit.
Chu Chu Chu,

1684
01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:58.710
he eats it like big league chew.
I'm supposed to have like one o'clock.
Yeah,

1685
01:37:58.711 --> 01:38:02.730
he's got them all in his mouth all day.
He goes,
he's chained you.
Yeah.

1686
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:07.110
Can you change you?
Of course you can.
How bad is that Shit for you?

1687
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.800
Do they know it's not that bad for you that,
that,
that it's just,
you know,

1688
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:12.720
cause you're not supposed to eat it every day.

1689
01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:14.190
You're supposed to actually quit smoking.

1690
01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.840
<v 0>They say nicotine though.</v>

1691
01:38:15.841 --> 01:38:19.320
I is actually like a supplement and nicotine itself.

1692
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:23.580
Not only is it not bad for you,
it's the distribution device that fucks you up.

1693
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:27.540
The burning it and chemicals and those chemicals designed to enhance the

1694
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.850
addictive qualities of a tobacco.

1695
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:33.250
But they say that if you can get your nicotine like a liquid form,

1696
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.500
it actually has positive health benefits.
Yeah,
it's relaxing.

1697
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:42.640
It makes,
it said that's not true.
I believe you,
but it doesn't make me relax.

1698
01:38:42.641 --> 01:38:43.880
The only nicotine,
uh,

1699
01:38:43.881 --> 01:38:48.820
I ever get is in the form of cigars and uh,
it makes my

1700
01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:53.830
<v 3>and heart rush.
What?
That's that you're,
you're taking in so much nicotine?</v>

1701
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:58.330
Yeah.
Because it's like cigarette times a million.
You get high as fuck.
Yeah,

1702
01:38:58.331 --> 01:39:01.090
and it's still,
you still get it and right when it hits your cheeks,

1703
01:39:01.091 --> 01:39:03.130
you're getting that smoke in your mouth.

1704
01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:04.350
<v 0>People don't know.</v>

1705
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:06.600
They don't want to admit that you're getting high when you're smoking a cigar.

1706
01:39:06.601 --> 01:39:10.080
It's the reason why men like smoking cigars just not just to be stinky and to

1707
01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:15.060
keep women away.
You know?
It's not like bug spray for women.
No,

1708
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:16.043
it gets you high.

1709
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.950
<v 3>It gets your grow like crazy too.
It's like you're doing bong hits.</v>

1710
01:39:19.951 --> 01:39:21.930
I've cigarettes pretty much is what you're doing.

1711
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:25.400
What do you think about girls and smoke cigars?
I got an odd thing.

1712
01:39:28.190 --> 01:39:32.100
Dangerous cal little,
an untied tie,
you know,

1713
01:39:32.370 --> 01:39:34.680
like she was about to take it off guard.

1714
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:38.880
She takes her hat and puts it on the ship.
Glasses on.
Fuck.
Yes.
Yeah,

1715
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:43.130
she stepped glasses for sure.
Just glasses,
but no under that.

1716
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.360
She's a bad girl.
Very back.
She's a bad girl.
Just chef garter belts on.
You know,

1717
01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:52.550
she has one that she's about to pull off,
but yeah.
Okay.
Now you just got,
yeah,

1718
01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.400
she one,

1719
01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.240
<v 0>but to pull off,</v>

1720
01:39:56.310 --> 01:40:01.020
women have all sorts of little things that they get to wear to enhance like

1721
01:40:01.050 --> 01:40:03.400
shoes that make the legs longer and

1722
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.660
fish nets and

1723
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:10.560
men are pretty much resigned to close,

1724
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:15.630
but women have closed that will offer real sexual suggestion.
You know,

1725
01:40:15.631 --> 01:40:17.730
like those,
first of all,

1726
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:22.170
women are allowed to wear sleeveless shirts pretty much everywhere.

1727
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:26.520
We're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No worries.
Just you'd have to have sleeves,

1728
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.180
take your sleeves off,
but if a man goes around with no sleeves,

1729
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.390
if a man goes around with no sleeves,
that guy's a douche bag.
You know,

1730
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:39.750
if a man walks around in a tank top,
he's a meathead and a douchebag.

1731
01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.810
But women every day go sleeveless.

1732
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:47.640
Like you go to a normal office and women or sleeveless on a regular basis.

1733
01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:51.660
<v 3>I fucking hate those wife beater tank tops.
Things like jam band here.</v>

1734
01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:53.830
Jam Band wears it all the time

1735
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.070
<v 2>and it's like,
oh,
thanks.
Now I can see a puff of armpit hair.</v>

1736
01:40:57.071 --> 01:40:58.900
I guess we have a problem with my man here.

1737
01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:01.450
I don't need to see your little baby bushes.
Yeah,

1738
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:04.720
you're just not manly enough handle it.
You're not manly enough for a tank top,

1739
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:08.380
but it's,
it's,
it implies a Douche genus.
It's unavoidable at this point.

1740
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:12.100
And in our society,
when you wear a tank top,
she looked douchey.

1741
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:16.840
Even if you're trying not to,
it sucks,
but it's unavoidable.
You know,

1742
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:19.240
it's like you're trying a little too hard.

1743
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.560
Just a wee bit too hard lot.
But Women Shit,

1744
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:28.390
they could wear tank tops everywhere.
This is a story about this very,
very,

1745
01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:32.380
very large crocodile trap.
The tourist for two weeks.
Yeah,
I read about that.

1746
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.393
It was a,

1747
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:38.730
he said it was something like 18 feet long and every time he went out into the

1748
01:41:38.891 --> 01:41:42.310
water,
it would pop up and start head towards him.
And he was like,
fuck that.

1749
01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:44.650
Want to feet long?
It head back to shore 20,

1750
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.060
they just killed two of the biggest alligators they've ever killed in

1751
01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:51.540
Mississippi.
They broke the world record,
uh,

1752
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:55.600
the Mississippi rather record twice in a day.

1753
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.020
They cut two of them that were over 700 pounds.

1754
01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:03.850
She's got to see the pictures of him.
Holy fucking shit.
They're giant.

1755
01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:10.390
You know the,
the picture has the caption dinosaur.
Also dinosaurs are real,

1756
01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:15.340
you know,
let you know,
like these are real animals.
These are gigantic lizards.

1757
01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:17.440
Put that picture up.
Oh shit man.

1758
01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:21.580
27 minutes ago there was a 6.5 earthquake in Japan.

1759
01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:26.180
Oh Christ.
Are you kidding me?
Oh fuck man.

1760
01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:27.310
Like five dude.

1761
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:32.680
Where in Japan is zoo islands east?

1762
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.550
It's so scary.
I can show you this.

1763
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:38.850
<v 0>It Fukushima gets hit again.</v>

1764
01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:42.870
There are fucked and we're fucked to California's fucked.
Oh Shit.

1765
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.280
This idea of putting together a fucking nuclear reactor right by the ocean and

1766
01:42:47.281 --> 01:42:48.750
not having a way to shut it off.

1767
01:42:48.751 --> 01:42:52.320
If the waves come over the top of where you anticipated it.

1768
01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.300
What a shit idea.
It's amazing that anybody ever let them do this right.

1769
01:42:57.301 --> 01:43:01.020
And cocoa and there's so many of these fucking things that are all over our

1770
01:43:01.021 --> 01:43:05.160
coasts as well.
And I'm like,
well,
these are better,
these are made better,

1771
01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:08.520
and these are,
we have fail safes,
failproof safes,

1772
01:43:08.521 --> 01:43:12.210
and make sure that this is not going to be a thing of concern,

1773
01:43:12.211 --> 01:43:17.160
but we have done as establish a series of protocols and case of an emergency.

1774
01:43:17.161 --> 01:43:21.030
Well,
we have to shut down the rare bitch.
If the shit hits the fan,

1775
01:43:21.031 --> 01:43:22.590
the shit hits the fan.
Okay?

1776
01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.060
If a fucking asteroids slams in the middle of the ocean and a giant thousand

1777
01:43:27.061 --> 01:43:31.020
foot wave comes over and knocks that motherfucker down or rips all the fucking

1778
01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:32.220
ground out underneath,

1779
01:43:32.221 --> 01:43:36.300
it fucks up all the electrical system that's connecting all your cooling

1780
01:43:36.301 --> 01:43:40.560
bullshit and just you have an an unapproachable area.

1781
01:43:40.561 --> 01:43:45.561
Now you have a fucking gigantic nuclear reactor that's melting down into the

1782
01:43:46.681 --> 01:43:50.130
earth itself,
leaky in the ocean.
That's what they have in Japan.

1783
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.070
I fucking thing's like billions of gallons of toxic water into the ocean.

1784
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:58.790
They're showing an increase in the level of radiation that are in fish.

1785
01:43:58.820 --> 01:43:59.900
It's just started.

1786
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:03.830
That stuff is good for hundreds of thousands of years.

1787
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.290
This is such a terrifying environmental disaster and it's just happening.

1788
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:14.340
And no one even knows what the fuck do about it.
And I think it's if,

1789
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.710
if the government really wants to act and Syria,
you know,
diff protect us,

1790
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.690
why the fuck aren't they over there doing everything they can to stop this

1791
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:26.120
nuclear reactor from leaking into the ocean?

1792
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:28.540
Why don't we put all our resources right?

1793
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.370
<v 2>All of them,
all of them,
like literally everything.
Try to figure out all the,</v>

1794
01:44:33.371 --> 01:44:34.520
all of our budget,

1795
01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.360
<v 0>everything we,</v>

1796
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.060
you got to save the planet right now you've got something that's leaking toxic

1797
01:44:40.061 --> 01:44:42.910
waste in the planet and people say,
I'm exaggerating.

1798
01:44:42.911 --> 01:44:47.290
And not from what I looked at from what I looked at online and actual tasks,

1799
01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:48.790
they've shown an increase,

1800
01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:53.820
a measurable increase in the radioactive qualities of fish and they've showed

1801
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:55.450
that this,
this toxic waste,

1802
01:44:55.451 --> 01:44:59.620
it's leaking is a significant disaster and it's not stopping.

1803
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.070
<v 3>I was talking to you,
remember my friend Coco,
you know,</v>

1804
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:04.300
in Tokyo and I was talking to this the other day,

1805
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:08.180
I've been sending her news things,
news reports of all their recent,
you know,

1806
01:45:08.181 --> 01:45:11.090
shit or finding out and it was new to her.
She was like,

1807
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:13.490
and half the shit she couldn't,
it was blocked.

1808
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:17.840
Like she couldn't even look at these news stories from Tokyo.
She's like,

1809
01:45:17.841 --> 01:45:21.470
what is it?
And so I would send her screenshots and,
and like she was like,

1810
01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:23.570
oh well they weren't getting this news.

1811
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:26.400
She acted like they were not getting the news that she had no,

1812
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:28.880
no idea about any of this.
And then she was,
you know,

1813
01:45:28.881 --> 01:45:31.490
it was so weird to hearing her,
you know,
like we,
you know,

1814
01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:35.810
the old people built this country and we have to respect them and help them,

1815
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:37.130
you know,
and stuff like that.
Like how,

1816
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.370
and then finally I just kept on sending more and more and she's like,
ah,

1817
01:45:40.371 --> 01:45:42.590
yeah that's sucks.
What am I supposed to do?

1818
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:45.260
And I feel kind of bad cause he's in there,
you know,

1819
01:45:45.261 --> 01:45:48.590
she's eating the fish everyday,
she's breathing that right?

1820
01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:52.160
She's getting what we're going to get next year and we're acting like this isn't

1821
01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:54.950
a big asteroid that's flying towards earth that's about to hit.

1822
01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.320
We were just like,
oh this sucks.
Look at these cute maps.

1823
01:45:57.490 --> 01:46:01.430
Like we should be throwing space shuttles in the ocean or whatever we can do to,

1824
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:03.710
to figure out that quick

1825
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:06.620
<v 2>cause yeah.
I don't know how they have to be good next year.
Yeah.</v>

1826
01:46:06.810 --> 01:46:10.530
One of the things they're talking about is building this gigantic $400 million

1827
01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:13.830
ice wall.
Have you seen that?
No.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Pull that up.

1828
01:46:14.190 --> 01:46:17.550
Building ice wall and Fukushima.
It's uh,

1829
01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:21.240
it seems like a hail Mary Man.
I don't know if it really works that way.

1830
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.730
<v 3>What if though,
what if I mean,
but isn't like Hawaii.</v>

1831
01:46:25.731 --> 01:46:26.610
You're going to get this in six.

1832
01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.320
<v 2>Oh yeah,
they already got it.
Oh,
they already got it.
Yeah,
they already got it.</v>

1833
01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:34.320
Hawaii without a doubt has gotten some of the radiation.
No doubt.

1834
01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:38.280
If you look at the plume of radioactive waste that's coming off of it,

1835
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:44.030
<v 3>Japan to spend over $300 million on ice wall to isolate Fukushima water leak.</v>

1836
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:45.560
<v 0>I've seen it here.</v>

1837
01:46:45.561 --> 01:46:50.190
It says on the BBC it says 470 million said Japan

1838
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:54.120
<v 2>has pledged 470 million for this ice wall.
Who gives a fuck how much it is.</v>

1839
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.920
So crazy idea.
Yes.

1840
01:46:58.010 --> 01:47:02.890
<v 6>Time.
It sounds like science fiction,</v>

1841
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.390
massive underground wall of ice,
so cold,
so strong,

1842
01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.550
it stops hundreds of tons of radioactive water seeping out of Fukushima power

1843
01:47:12.551 --> 01:47:16.240
plant tanks and into the Pacific.
This is no movie.

1844
01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:21.450
It is a $320 million emergency plan announced today by the Japanese government.

1845
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:22.810
Wow.

1846
01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:27.520
Here's how it would work in above ground refrigerator chills a coolant to minus

1847
01:47:27.521 --> 01:47:29.050
40 degrees Fahrenheit.

1848
01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:33.790
That icy liquid gets pumped into steel pipes dug below the crippled plant,

1849
01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.740
just like a kitchen freezer.

1850
01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.920
Everything around those pipes also freezes a giant wall of ice forms stretching

1851
01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:46.291
nearly a mile long and nearly 10 stories below ground about the height of the

1852
01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:51.490
Lincoln Memorial.
Some scientists say this may just be a short term fix,

1853
01:47:51.610 --> 01:47:55.960
but something has to be done soon before there's even greater damage to the

1854
01:47:55.961 --> 01:47:58.240
environment and Japan's economy,
right?

1855
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.970
<v 7>It might not be as much way to activities Chernobyl,</v>

1856
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:03.810
but for the ocean is unprecedented as an accidental source.

1857
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:08.160
We've never seen this much radiation coming out of a reactive site directly into

1858
01:48:08.161 --> 01:48:08.790
the ocean.

1859
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:12.480
<v 6>But there has been nothing like the size and scope of the wall to come for</v>

1860
01:48:12.481 --> 01:48:13.350
Fukushima,

1861
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:18.590
where radiation levels are a staggering 18 times higher than previously thought

1862
01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:22.770
enough to kill a person after just four hours of exposure.

1863
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:25.710
So what does this mean for the fish that makes its way to us?

1864
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:27.540
Waters from Japan so far.

1865
01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:29.120
<v 2>That's fucked up.
Well listen to that</v>

1866
01:48:29.230 --> 01:48:33.930
<v 6>found any unsafe levels of radiation.
But with these constraints,
rakes,</v>

1867
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:37.210
scientists say we'll come and increasingly sharper.

1868
01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:41.620
Look at the fish we eat and the waters they swim in.
Cecilia Vega,

1869
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.600
ABC News,
Los Angeles.

1870
01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:47.650
<v 2>Wow.
Fuck.</v>

1871
01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:52.850
I mean so Colorado or Texas?
Colorado.
Oh No.
Texas.
No.
Cotton.

1872
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:57.210
Texas.
Yes.
100% taxes.
Hi Austin.
Yeah,

1873
01:48:57.211 --> 01:49:02.140
but Texas is got more the most protection of any state gun wise.

1874
01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.330
Yeah.
That's not what you need to worry about.

1875
01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.720
It's like being in a base compared to,
I don't know man.

1876
01:49:07.721 --> 01:49:11.410
I feel like there's a lot of secrets in Denver,

1877
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.630
like underground missiles and stuff like that.

1878
01:49:13.631 --> 01:49:16.540
And I think that's going to be a target.
That's all you silly bitch.

1879
01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:18.640
You don't think so?
No.
No,
I don't think so.

1880
01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.110
I don't think anybody's targeting Denver.

1881
01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.330
I think this is Wacko conspiracy theory.

1882
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:25.030
I think they just built a really sophisticated airport with a lot of tunnels in

1883
01:49:25.031 --> 01:49:27.370
it.
I'm done with snow.
I can't do it.
So maybe,
uh,

1884
01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:32.200
Austin and a winner and I think I could do the winter in boulder.

1885
01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.090
I really do.
Or Evergreen or any of those mountain towns.
I think I could do it.

1886
01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.810
I think you just got to just change how you look at life.

1887
01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.670
I think the winter just becomes a different thing.

1888
01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.130
Austin food versus Houston or awesome food versus Denver food.
Austin

1889
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.870
<v 3>women versus Denver Women.</v>

1890
01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:53.830
<v 2>You real estate versus Denver real estate,</v>

1891
01:49:54.110 --> 01:49:58.610
real estate's pretty commensurate.
Anytime I can use the word commensurate I do.

1892
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:04.640
Um,
I think it's pretty similar,
you know,
I mean,
they're both,

1893
01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:07.340
they're both desirable places to live.

1894
01:50:07.610 --> 01:50:11.750
We need to get his closest to Alex Jones as possible too.
Hmm.
That's important.

1895
01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.100
Maybe we could have a show on the Alex Jones network.
We can move to Austin.

1896
01:50:16.101 --> 01:50:18.440
We don't need to get her own studio.
We just take over at night.

1897
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:22.700
That'd be awesome.
Totally.
I'm sure it hits,

1898
01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:27.320
people thinks that I don't like him cause I,
I goof on him,
but I just,

1899
01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.280
I just goof on him because I can do as voice or buddy.
We love that guy.

1900
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:33.830
I actually legitimately hang around with Alex Jones.

1901
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:37.520
Like legitimately I'm not bullshitting.
I'm not a,
I'm not trolling.

1902
01:50:37.930 --> 01:50:42.740
Oh he's a great guy.
Fun Guy to party with.
He's a,
he's hilarious.

1903
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:46.460
He says a lot of funny shit and he's exposed me to a lot of stuff.

1904
01:50:46.461 --> 01:50:48.290
That's the old school green room man.

1905
01:50:48.291 --> 01:50:52.280
They fucked up when they taped over that painted the whole thing.
Oh,

1906
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:53.570
I don't know why they did that.

1907
01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.720
<v 8>Oh and push the private presence.
So the drug dealers,</v>

1908
01:50:58.510 --> 01:51:03.320
the criminals go rob houses to get the money for the drugs.
Then Alex Jones

1909
01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.450
<v 9>Disney up the documents,</v>

1910
01:51:05.451 --> 01:51:08.390
but black helicopters can trails and tower seven went down.

1911
01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.560
[inaudible]

1912
01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:27.520
<v 8>don't try it again.</v>

1913
01:51:31.290 --> 01:51:33.380
<v 3>I want to live right next to Alex charms.</v>

1914
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:35.310
I want to hang out with Alex Jones every single day.

1915
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.200
<v 2>Well,
we could do that if we relocated to Texas.</v>

1916
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.410
I'd have to convince Mrs Rogan.

1917
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:45.660
The other problem with Texas is a Austin is bad ass.
Houston's Badass.

1918
01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:50.320
Dallas is bad ass,
but damn,
there's some spooky spots in the middle.

1919
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:54.490
There's some spooky drive through areas where you get out,

1920
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:59.260
you get out and just take a right and go straight and then get out and start

1921
01:51:59.261 --> 01:52:02.290
talking to people and you're a Goddamn Texas chainsaw massacre moon.

1922
01:52:02.490 --> 01:52:05.610
<v 3>Same Shit here though.
You go up bigger and competent to go up.</v>

1923
01:52:05.611 --> 01:52:08.820
You're in the fucking farm in the middle of California where there's fucking

1924
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:11.760
assessed.
That's a good point.
It is a good point.

1925
01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:15.630
Especially about the middle of a California,
California spots were

1926
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:17.240
<v 2>driving up to San Francisco.</v>

1927
01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:22.480
Those farms with the Republican sayings on the signs to see drivers.

1928
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:27.160
We won't educate.
They paper right here.
Fucking put up a sign.
Yeah.

1929
01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:30.530
You know,
do you really want Obama?
Is your president?

1930
01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.340
Do you really think he was born in the United States?

1931
01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:37.610
Like there's a whole series of them.
When Mitt Romney was running for president,

1932
01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:42.680
they were hilarious.
They were so stupid.
It might as well be Kentucky.

1933
01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:46.850
Nothing wrong with Kentucky if you live there and love,
but let's be honest,

1934
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.520
the techies,
nice man.
A lot of people weren't nice.
Nice.

1935
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:53.210
Louisville's Nice West Virginia at me,
man.
I'm okay with the Little Ville.

1936
01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:57.350
Improv was fucking bad ass.
That was a great place to work at.
It was really fun.

1937
01:52:57.580 --> 01:53:00.860
I love that place.
Yeah,
but look,

1938
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:04.850
the reality is the world's changing and all those places that sucked 20,

1939
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:07.700
30 years ago,
they suck less now.
If people have internet,

1940
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.830
they just do people getting thing.

1941
01:53:09.831 --> 01:53:12.860
A kids high school kids are getting it more than they've ever been there.

1942
01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:17.030
There'll be exposed to more ideas and they've ever been before.
It's less,

1943
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:21.980
sucks less to live somewhere that sucks now than at any other time in human

1944
01:53:21.981 --> 01:53:24.650
history.
That said,

1945
01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:29.660
Texas is still illegal weed Gestapo like police tactics.

1946
01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:34.310
Has there been any of rest of the Willie Nelson and they arrested?
Um,

1947
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:37.700
what's her name?
The fucking shadow dancer.
It tells her name.

1948
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:42.380
Fiona Apple.
Ooh,
she saw that.

1949
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:47.400
I gave her my seat on a plane ones.
Yeah,
it was her.

1950
01:53:47.401 --> 01:53:50.600
I just want to sit next to her sister and she asks this lady to do it and the

1951
01:53:50.601 --> 01:53:55.130
lady wouldn't move.
She goes,
no,
this is my seat.
It's like,
Whoa,
snap.
Yeah.

1952
01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:59.920
That was right behind.
So I swapped with that.
After you first did right here,

1953
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.520
you can sit on my lap.
Oh,
you,

1954
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:05.110
I cleared off a place on my face for set.

1955
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.380
Maybe you're going to be in Texas sooner or where did you already did that?
No.

1956
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.530
Yeah,
I'm going to be in Houston.
Lucky son.
That's,
um,

1957
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:19.230
October 18th.
He fucking Ha.

1958
01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.010
Just one night though.
Yeah.
Just one night.

1959
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:27.250
It's the night before the UFC was the UFC and Houston done the Austin?

1960
01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.210
Nope.
To the comedy club.
Maybe.
That'd be awesome.
The problem is I do the theater.

1961
01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:37.560
I'm like Austin City La.
That's like 2000 seats plus fine.
Yeah,

1962
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:41.090
but it's,
it's,
it's harder for me to do that with kids.

1963
01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:43.810
It's harder for me to get away with four full weekends.
You know,

1964
01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.740
he bumps you out,
man with a three year old tells you they miss you.
Like,
oof.

1965
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:51.260
That's hard,
man.
Duct tape,
man.
Nothing.
Changes it more

1966
01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:54.680
I think.
Yep.
It was a bad one.

1967
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:59.870
Nothing changes it more than a little babies you have with the adventures of

1968
01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:03.560
iPads and stuff.
It's not the same dude.
It's not the same.
They miss you.

1969
01:55:03.561 --> 01:55:05.870
They want to hug you.
It's,
it becomes a real borrower.

1970
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:10.520
Like you get you gotta I just gotta have to optimize my time.
I don't like,

1971
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:13.400
like the problem.
I liked doing some comedy club weekends,

1972
01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:17.420
but it's all about like if I,
if I,
if it's a UFC weekend with,

1973
01:55:17.421 --> 01:55:19.070
the easiest thing about it is I get to do both.

1974
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:22.700
I can do comedy one night and then I'd do the UFC the next night if I'm going to

1975
01:55:22.701 --> 01:55:25.520
do,
uh,
like cab city,
like cap,
CD,

1976
01:55:25.521 --> 01:55:28.610
I would do like Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday or Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.

1977
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:32.210
It's a lot of days I get the same amount of people in there.
Yeah,

1978
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:33.620
there's a lot of benefits to it.

1979
01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.630
The big benefit is that your act becomes bulletproof after like five shows,

1980
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:40.490
you know,
because you do a lot of shows,

1981
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:42.980
like that's the best way to tighten up for a comedy special.

1982
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:44.070
Do a lot of like two,

1983
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.210
<v 0>300 seat clubs.</v>

1984
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:50.540
Like everything just gets so tight it gets so like you just know the timing and

1985
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:54.120
it just gets razor sharp.
Yeah.
By the way I tip,
I think,

1986
01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.780
I don't know if you agree with me is that if you're always looking to add a

1987
01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:02.130
weekend of like comic,
always go for the Sunday one show Sunday.

1988
01:56:02.131 --> 01:56:06.690
It's like an eight o'clock show because not only is there usually a longer show

1989
01:56:06.691 --> 01:56:08.760
cause there's not a sh a second show after it,

1990
01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:13.110
but it's also a that much perfected show I think.
You know like cause like what?

1991
01:56:13.111 --> 01:56:15.030
Like you're saying you're there Friday side.

1992
01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.450
If you're going to see a show with the stage,
you're comfortable at times.

1993
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.120
Sometimes the energy is different though.

1994
01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:23.070
Sometimes the energy of people on a Sunday night,

1995
01:56:23.071 --> 01:56:24.480
they're a little bit more laid back.

1996
01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.820
Where's the like hyped up on Friday and Saturday and true.

1997
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.630
Part of the going to a comedy club is also people around you laughing hard.

1998
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:33.480
That's a weird thing about comedy is it's very contagious.

1999
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.840
But that's the thing about having a giant crowd as opposed to having a small

2000
01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:42.970
crowd when the crowd is literally 10 times larger than the average car,

2001
01:56:42.971 --> 01:56:47.250
like a 3000 seater that even you have to be like first of all you have to be

2002
01:56:47.251 --> 01:56:51.210
really on top of the timing of the thing because who they have to really

2003
01:56:51.211 --> 01:56:52.540
understand what you have to know when to,

2004
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.560
when to talk and when to let them laugh cause they might not be able to hear you

2005
01:56:55.561 --> 01:56:59.580
as clearly cause there's so many people and then you also got to realize that

2006
01:56:59.581 --> 01:57:02.130
like the contagious element of it is not as strong.

2007
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.030
The contagious element of like a comedy clubs incredibly infectious.

2008
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:09.570
Like you're on top of each other.
It's a low ceiling and the laughters rang out.

2009
01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:13.140
It's like Ah.
It just,
it like literally like takes over your body.

2010
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:17.070
It's like a better experience.
We can't get as many people into a place

2011
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:22.830
but some people their,
their style is better suited for a big crowd.

2012
01:57:23.010 --> 01:57:25.560
Some people have a different style.
They have like a bigger,

2013
01:57:25.561 --> 01:57:30.060
broader style and that style does not do well in intimate environment.

2014
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.570
You know?
That's,
that's interesting too.
I just think that it feels better.

2015
01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.620
It feels like when you're on a big stage,
it's amazing how many people are there,

2016
01:57:37.621 --> 01:57:42.300
but you're kind of like yelling out into this empty blackness.
You know,

2017
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:44.340
like if you're at a comedy club,

2018
01:57:44.341 --> 01:57:48.600
you feel like you can like see faces and it feels just the whole feeling of,

2019
01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:49.290
you know,

2020
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:54.090
you can feel everybody's smile I most at you or frown.

2021
01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:56.220
Yeah,
I know what I mean.
Totally.
Well,

2022
01:57:56.221 --> 01:57:58.060
you can only like a place like the ice house.

2023
01:57:58.061 --> 01:58:00.870
He could basically see everybody's face.
Yeah.
The entire club.

2024
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.490
Everybody who's there,
you could see their face.

2025
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.640
You know when you were in a place like the place I just did in Milwaukee,

2026
01:58:05.641 --> 01:58:09.060
the PAPP's theater and can't see shit.
You know,
you're just like,
ah.
Yeah.

2027
01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:13.080
There's the video of me going on.
Says you can't see shit.
You can,

2028
01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:18.150
you have a giant spotlight in your face.
You're,
uh,
there's,
there's three rows,

2029
01:58:18.151 --> 01:58:22.470
three levels,
the mid level and upper level.
You can't see shit.
She a little bit,

2030
01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.680
you know it's,
it's not,
it's not the same intimate thing.

2031
01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.920
But we were so lucky like the crowds come to see us are so fucking nice that

2032
01:58:31.171 --> 01:58:34.590
I've seen some of those big shows for other people go off the rails if they have

2033
01:58:34.591 --> 01:58:37.410
rude audience members.
But Dave Chappelle,

2034
01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.710
I saw that man that went completely off the rails.
I don't know what happened.

2035
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:44.830
I wasn't there to see the actual off the rail.
I just saw the videos.

2036
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.450
The videos seem to pick it up like sorta halfway into being off the rails.

2037
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:53.620
<v 3>But he's been opening up for him.
She every show he's been on the right of you.</v>

2038
01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:57.790
<v 0>That's probably the problem saying that with Brody's going crazy is the thing</v>

2039
01:58:57.791 --> 01:59:02.490
called,
what is it called?
Aloe.
Aloe phrenia.
Yeah,
I think it's called Al Phrenia.

2040
01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:05.920
And the idea is that if you have schizophrenia and I hang around with you,

2041
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.480
I start developing like weird symptoms and they bring me in for treatment

2042
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:12.670
because they bring me in for you know,

2043
01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:16.070
examination because I think I would develop schizophrenia from hanging out with

2044
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.770
schizophrenia and that's really possible.
Really?
Yes.
Yeah.

2045
01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.690
It's a real disease.
Yeah.
I'll Google it.

2046
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:24.240
<v 3>Wow.
Aloe phrenia you know,</v>

2047
01:59:24.241 --> 01:59:26.820
I was reading some shit the other day because people were saying that I am

2048
01:59:26.821 --> 01:59:29.460
starting to look like you.
And there was like,
there's like,
there's like,

2049
01:59:29.461 --> 01:59:30.241
I forget where it was,

2050
01:59:30.241 --> 01:59:33.900
but like this thread that was like 20 pages long and there was breaking it down

2051
01:59:33.901 --> 01:59:34.770
to,
they're like,
no,

2052
01:59:34.771 --> 01:59:38.340
there's actually this thing where you hang out with people enough.
You start not,

2053
01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:42.750
you're not realizing you're mimicking like muscles in your face to kind of,
uh,

2054
01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:46.260
to,
to copy them.
Kind of like that.
And the more you do it,

2055
01:59:46.290 --> 01:59:51.290
the more your actual face structure changes into a looking more and more like

2056
01:59:51.361 --> 01:59:53.670
the person.
That's why like married couples start,
you know,

2057
01:59:53.671 --> 01:59:57.000
when they get older they start kind of looking alike and stuff like that.

2058
01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.960
And it was an interesting,
I don't know if it's real or not,
but it's interesting.

2059
02:00:00.961 --> 02:00:03.990
I would like to figure that out more.
Yeah,

2060
02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.170
<v 0>that is interesting.</v>

2061
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:10.960
I know that women when they're around each other for a long time,
they will,
um,

2062
02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:15.310
they will change certain things like their,
their periods getting sync,

2063
02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:19.000
which is a really freaky,
yeah.
Ties with me.
Ras Al Phrenia.

2064
02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.910
Do you guys have the same period but periods here?
This,

2065
02:00:21.911 --> 02:00:24.430
this says less than normal mental development.
So this is,

2066
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:27.760
I'm looking at the wrong,
sorry.
This all,
oh,
all lego friends.

2067
02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.620
<v 10>Yeah,
a low forever.</v>

2068
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:34.433
So yeah,

2069
02:00:36.810 --> 02:00:40.710
I can't find that Ella phrenia except okay.

2070
02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:44.053
Huh.

2071
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:47.660
<v 0>I can't find it.
And if I keep looking like this,</v>

2072
02:00:47.661 --> 02:00:49.940
it's just going to eat up a lot of time and people are going to be like,

2073
02:00:49.941 --> 02:00:50.481
you know what dude,

2074
02:00:50.481 --> 02:00:54.290
I don't like listening to podcasts where people just fucking eat up time looking

2075
02:00:54.291 --> 02:00:55.640
for the definition of aloe.

2076
02:00:55.641 --> 02:01:00.641
Phrenia how phrenia I don't know if that fucking wall of ice is gonna work out,

2077
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:04.520
but I'm worried about that and I'm worried about moving somewhere and I'm not

2078
02:01:04.521 --> 02:01:08.000
joking because I think that if the shit does hit the fan,

2079
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:12.440
everyone's going to be looking at it like sort of last minute going,
Holy Shit,

2080
02:01:12.441 --> 02:01:13.274
where do we go?

2081
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:17.990
But if this fails and it becomes like a real issue,

2082
02:01:17.991 --> 02:01:21.680
like the water's being toxic and thyroid cancer and all sorts of things that go

2083
02:01:21.681 --> 02:01:24.730
along with radioactive poisoning and we have that issue.

2084
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:29.750
How long would it take to evacuate the west coast?
I mean,
Ge is us.
No,

2085
02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.660
you know how fucking crazy that would be if they have to evacuate the west
coast.

2086
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:37.650
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
well they would start with Japan first.
I would have hope.
But uh,</v>

2087
02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.700
yeah.
But the thing is that,
is this something that,

2088
02:01:41.701 --> 02:01:44.000
that people thought in the 60s you know,

2089
02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:47.990
is this something that everyone's panicking,
we're reading news reports that are,

2090
02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:51.680
you know,
like we have Neil degrasse Tyson and here's like,
everything's fine.

2091
02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:57.070
<v 0>It's fine.
This is,
I mean,
these are mainstream news reports.
This is the BBC.
Yeah.</v>

2092
02:01:57.150 --> 02:02:01.120
And this is talking about,
um,
this Fukushima ice wall mean.
This is not,

2093
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:06.520
I think it's pretty much across the board uniformly agreed that this is a real

2094
02:02:06.821 --> 02:02:09.250
issue.
Obviously it's a real issue.
I mean,

2095
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:11.530
they just said he could die in four hours if you're there

2096
02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:16.580
<v 3>just seems weird that the planet isn't capable of justice taking that out.</v>

2097
02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:17.970
Well,
you know what I mean?

2098
02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:22.200
<v 0>The planet,
it's not going to,
the problem is that people live on the planet.
Yeah.</v>

2099
02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:24.780
It'll,
it'll poison the environment for a few hundred thousand years.

2100
02:02:24.781 --> 02:02:27.780
But we don't understand this for a few hundred thousand years for the planet.

2101
02:02:27.781 --> 02:02:30.480
It ain't shit.
It doesn't matter.
Plan doesn't care.

2102
02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:32.550
The dinosaurs 65 million years ago,

2103
02:02:32.551 --> 02:02:35.700
the planet is still here and fine long after dinosaurs are dead.
Yeah.

2104
02:02:35.701 --> 02:02:38.190
It's got a new thing,
running things and the new thing,

2105
02:02:38.191 --> 02:02:43.191
it's fucking things up by digging holes and pulling out oil and putting up these

2106
02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:49.010
plants that split Adams and sometimes they go bad poison the entire ocean and,

2107
02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:53.490
but 200 years to the ocean ain't shit.
It's just to us that sucks.

2108
02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:59.060
It's to us that we could poison every person on this planet and the Earth would

2109
02:02:59.551 --> 02:03:02.910
eventually write itself and some new life form would emerge.

2110
02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.310
And that would happen.
And it may happen.

2111
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:10.230
It may happen just how the dinosaurs did it.
It may be a pandemic virus,

2112
02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.530
it may be a virus from space.
That's also a possibility.

2113
02:03:13.890 --> 02:03:17.250
And maybe something that someone brings back from space.

2114
02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:21.240
It may be something that came in and an asteroid like that movie the thing,

2115
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:26.040
you know,
that's possible.
It's not probable,
but it's possible.
It's also possible.

2116
02:03:26.041 --> 02:03:29.040
And asteroid can hit and just annihilate the planet.

2117
02:03:29.250 --> 02:03:33.720
Just like his happened many times in the past,
65 million years ago,

2118
02:03:33.721 --> 02:03:38.220
12,500 years ago,
a hundred,
200 million years before that,

2119
02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.340
there's been a gang of those.
They've happened more than once.

2120
02:03:41.850 --> 02:03:44.610
Giant fucking rocks come in and boom,

2121
02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:48.150
that could easily fuck the whole party up.

2122
02:03:48.210 --> 02:03:51.120
So that could easily make it so it doesn't matter if you,
uh,

2123
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:55.080
be clean up the ocean.
It doesn't matter if there's a big rock coming,

2124
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:57.810
just open your window,
stick your ass out and take a shit.

2125
02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:00.990
Okay cause you got two weeks left and this giant rocks going to hit everything.

2126
02:04:00.991 --> 02:04:04.560
It doesn't matter if there's a gigantic pyramid of shit out your bedroom window,

2127
02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:08.640
it really doesn't matter.
You're going to die.
Everything's going to be rewritten.

2128
02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.100
The entire process is going to start a new,

2129
02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.150
<v 3>that'd be awesome if like they have to like really take everyone out of Japan</v>

2130
02:04:16.210 --> 02:04:19.690
and so like why would that be on the United States offers?
He's like,
Hey,

2131
02:04:19.691 --> 02:04:23.470
we'll take all the women
out of nowhere.

2132
02:04:23.471 --> 02:04:27.790
It's just easiest Asian population.
That'd be cool.

2133
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:32.350
I think if Japan needs to be evacuated,
we have to evacuate California too.
Dude.

2134
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:35.680
Yo.
Yeah,
I think it's probably going to be in New York state of mind.

2135
02:04:35.710 --> 02:04:38.550
I think Denver's not enough away from the ocean.

2136
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.290
<v 2>I don't know if anything's far off away.</v>

2137
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:43.310
I don't know if Texas is far enough away.
It's a different kind notion though,

2138
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.120
right?
For the most part it's not tucked in and blocked by the whole con,
uh,

2139
02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:52.110
whatever.
I mean it's a different,
see that's affecting you,

2140
02:04:52.111 --> 02:04:56.220
but that one's all fucked up too.
That one's all fucked up from the BP oil spill,

2141
02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:59.790
but it's warmer.
Do.
Yeah,

2142
02:04:59.791 --> 02:05:04.110
it's warmer and it's also connected to Mexico and those people sneaking across

2143
02:05:04.111 --> 02:05:07.980
every day try live in uh,
right outside of a of Juarez.

2144
02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:09.990
Good luck with that.
You might as well.

2145
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:13.470
We live in next to the most dangerous spot in the world.
Oh,
guess what you are.

2146
02:05:13.770 --> 02:05:16.800
You are living right next door to the most dangerous spot in the world.

2147
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:20.190
War has a super dangerous,
and it's just a wall,

2148
02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:23.550
just a wall over there across the river,
the Rio Grande Day,

2149
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:27.220
while you're protected in Austin,
they,
you know,
you're not protected.

2150
02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.780
That's just a few hours drive when it's fucking God.
Guns and shit.
Yeah.

2151
02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:33.280
Some people have guns,
but you don't.
So with differences May,

2152
02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:35.250
can I go over someone's house?
Hey Man,
let me use your gun.

2153
02:05:35.251 --> 02:05:38.760
They're going to shoot.
You know,
I'll be dating a girl that has a gun.
Oh,

2154
02:05:38.761 --> 02:05:40.830
there you go.
You're going to be taken care of by a woman.

2155
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:43.440
You're just the opposite of the Huffington post story.

2156
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:46.680
You get underneath the bed.
Brian,
I've got to take care of these shoes.

2157
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:51.600
These genius for you.
Oh God,
Dude.
What is the jigger?

2158
02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.300
What does a Jig or what are you talking about?
I don't know.

2159
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:56.320
It seems like that's like a racial slur.
Jiggers it's not,

2160
02:05:56.321 --> 02:05:58.820
but doesn't it sound like I've got an old thing?
Like there's no,

2161
02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.600
you are retarded,
dude.
You're going Oh,
too far now.

2162
02:06:03.601 --> 02:06:07.290
That wasn't supposed to be racist.
It is though.
It seems like a twig and word is,

2163
02:06:07.291 --> 02:06:09.810
but no,
it doesn't.
Seems like you're saying nigger with a j.

2164
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:12.240
That's what it seems like.
Dummy.
How dare you?

2165
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:17.040
It's probably a,
well,
it's a term for fishing.

2166
02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:21.600
You'd Jig for fish for like,
so like if this,

2167
02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:26.490
if this does really become a problem,
would you ever move to New York?
Fuck No.

2168
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.840
That might be the spot to move too.
Fuck.
Quite quite realistically though.

2169
02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:34.770
That might be the spot to move to.
Yeah.
Hell,
I'd rather go to Canada.

2170
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:37.980
I will be up in Canada.
It's see you later.
Chandler is not a bad idea,

2171
02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:41.730
but the problem with Canada is the West Coast Canada is where it's warm.

2172
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:44.790
So you'd want to live there and that is right by the ocean.

2173
02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:48.840
So that's just as bad as living in Alaska,
just as bad as living in Washington.

2174
02:06:49.410 --> 02:06:50.370
The oceans bad.

2175
02:06:51.150 --> 02:06:55.980
The idea is that if all of this really plays out and people start getting

2176
02:06:55.981 --> 02:07:00.320
cancer,
start getting really sick,
it's,
you know,

2177
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:03.000
it's everything by the ocean.
You gotta get the fuck away from the ocean,

2178
02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:07.590
you know,
that's a real possibility.
This is,

2179
02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:09.810
I mean we're talking like it's nonsense.

2180
02:07:09.811 --> 02:07:13.650
Like this is like almost like a story we have to do this soon.
Like a year,

2181
02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:15.750
Gerald,
this is when it's supposed to hit la.

2182
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:20.100
We're pretty much have a slow moving asteroid coming to us and we have to figure

2183
02:07:20.101 --> 02:07:23.730
out if we want to just enjoy the asteroids and half Shitty,

2184
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:26.730
you're going to fix it.
We're gonna fix it all.

2185
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:32.270
It's amazing that like Malibu could be a poison ocean within the decade.

2186
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:37.600
Like if this motherfucker keeps leaking and the plume keeps just going across

2187
02:07:37.601 --> 02:07:40.150
the ocean and headache towards Malibu,

2188
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.910
like people are saying it could be a mass extinction event.

2189
02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.470
Right now there's people going,
well you're doing is fear mongering.

2190
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:50.170
You don't know enough to be,
you're right.
I don't know enough,

2191
02:07:50.590 --> 02:07:55.590
but the scary scary story that I read online is it could be a mass extinction of

2192
02:07:56.261 --> 02:08:00.130
that worst case scenario.
Let's Google it.
Worst case scenario,

2193
02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:04.800
<v 3>I think it would be more like a slow moving extinction like meaning like you</v>

2194
02:08:04.801 --> 02:08:06.330
have to get out of Japan,
are you going to die?

2195
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:09.570
There's going to be all these like,
like respect,
like this is our country.

2196
02:08:09.571 --> 02:08:13.110
I'm going to stay here and then they're going to slowly die from health
problems,

2197
02:08:13.111 --> 02:08:13.944
but,

2198
02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:17.730
<v 2>and they're okay.
This is what I said.
I said,</v>

2199
02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:21.420
what is the worst case scenario?
Right,
so I go to,

2200
02:08:22.130 --> 02:08:22.650
<v 4>okay,</v>

2201
02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:25.620
<v 2>telegraph.
Is that a legitimate site in the UK?</v>

2202
02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:30.550
<v 3>I think it's actually,
I don't think,
I don't know.
It seems like,</v>

2203
02:08:30.551 --> 02:08:31.930
I want to say it's like an inquiry.

2204
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.291
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2205
02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:35.440
well all these websites are saying the worst case scenario already happened.

2206
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.090
Scientific American.
Okay.
That's a legit website,
right?

2207
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:45.550
Our some say rt news.
National geographic.com.
Okay.

2208
02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:48.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2209
02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.810
<v 2>National Geographic is saying,</v>

2210
02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:52.553
<v 4>okay.</v>

2211
02:08:52.710 --> 02:08:52.891
<v 2>Oh,</v>

2212
02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:56.010
it's actually saying it's far from the worst case scenario for a nuclear plant.

2213
02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.740
Wait a second.
We haven't even like,
it's probably worse now with this earthquake.

2214
02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:03.060
Yeah.
Oh no doubt about it.
But we may only have like a week Joe.

2215
02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:06.000
Like people outside are probably running.
Yeah,

2216
02:09:06.001 --> 02:09:09.500
they're running across the ocean right now because the ocean is hard.
Yeah.

2217
02:09:10.590 --> 02:09:12.300
The rating sounds ominous to be sure,

2218
02:09:12.301 --> 02:09:15.210
but its real meaning and the significance of the Japanese official decision to

2219
02:09:15.211 --> 02:09:20.211
make a more dire assessment of the crisis are like many other ramifications of

2220
02:09:20.371 --> 02:09:22.560
the ongoing crisis.
A few Fukushima,

2221
02:09:22.710 --> 02:09:27.420
frustratingly unclear in some respects.
It's not that big of an issue.

2222
02:09:27.690 --> 02:09:30.450
What they call it explained David Locke Baum,

2223
02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:35.070
a veteran nuclear engineer who works as a safety advocate for the union of

2224
02:09:35.071 --> 02:09:39.090
concerned scientists.
He says it's still the same mess.

2225
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:43.950
Um,
why the rating now workers for the Tokyo Power Company,

2226
02:09:43.951 --> 02:09:47.310
which operates a plant discovered on the 19th of August,

2227
02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:49.410
that 300 tons,

2228
02:09:49.710 --> 02:09:54.710
72,000 gallons of highly radioactive water apparently had escaped from a holding

2229
02:09:55.531 --> 02:09:59.520
tank into the ground over the previous month.

2230
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:03.300
The water had been used to cool when a Fukushima's damaged reactors and in the

2231
02:10:03.301 --> 02:10:07.380
wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused one of the worst nuclear

2232
02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:12.560
accidents and history scientists taken from containment area showed it to be so

2233
02:10:13.411 --> 02:10:18.411
heavily contaminated with strontium 90 and celsion one 37 and radioactive

2234
02:10:18.901 --> 02:10:23.901
substances that a person's standing less than two feet away would receive in an

2235
02:10:24.150 --> 02:10:24.370
hour's time,

2236
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:29.280
a radiation dose equivalent to five times the acceptable exposure for nuclear

2237
02:10:29.281 --> 02:10:34.281
workers within 10 hours and exposed person would develop radiation with symptoms

2238
02:10:34.401 --> 02:10:37.460
such as nausea and a drop in white blood cells.

2239
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.520
But that other thing said that this might be less recent because the other thing

2240
02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:45.530
said that four hours,
the thing that we looked at,

2241
02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:48.530
it said in four hours you could die.
Right.

2242
02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:53.660
So it was saying that it must be several times stronger than the previous

2243
02:10:53.661 --> 02:10:57.800
assessment,
which this must be based on,
which is like that's really dire.

2244
02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.320
Like we have to recognize that this is something that we really need to consider

2245
02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:05.690
because it seems like a plot in the movie.

2246
02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:09.170
It seems like something that's playing out on TV,
just like Syria,

2247
02:11:09.210 --> 02:11:11.990
just like Egypt.
It seems like something that's on TV.

2248
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:18.950
Fuck man.
So my vote Texas,

2249
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:24.410
even though they have like I think three or four nuclear plants in Texas.
Yeah.

2250
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:26.390
But there's a lot of dummies in Texas too,
man.

2251
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:27.950
There's a lot of really cool people too though.

2252
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:32.270
Like the reality of Austin is an island of awesome people.
Yeah.

2253
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:35.340
They have great food.
There was a great stunt sauce and he just,
he would say,

2254
02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.100
you know,
Houston has some good spots.
Um,

2255
02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:43.790
I think what's really cool about Austin is that it has a great art scene.

2256
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:48.410
It's got a great music scene.
A lot of funny comics would come out of Austin.

2257
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:53.330
He's got a couple of great comedy clubs.
Small Club.
Was it that Velveeta Room?

2258
02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:55.050
That's the small players.
Yeah.

2259
02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:59.240
They have a bunch of little satellite gigs that you could do if you live in
town,

2260
02:11:59.730 --> 02:12:02.510
you know,
like,
uh,
you could,
you could actually work in Austin.

2261
02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:06.710
You can get some work done as a comic.
So you would not,

2262
02:12:06.711 --> 02:12:11.540
you're never going to go back to Japan.
Obviously,
nope.
Nope,
nope,
nope.
That's it.

2263
02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:15.860
Is Ufc going?
I don't know.
Um,
I hope if they do,
everybody's safe,

2264
02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:17.061
but I've seen,

2265
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:20.960
it seems to me that that is a risk that's a unnecessary at this point.

2266
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:25.310
I feel like they have to do something about that because what if you were there

2267
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:29.510
and then the earthquake hit?
So say if you land and as you're landing,

2268
02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:34.190
you're watching the runway,
ripple hide inside of [inaudible] don't,
don't,

2269
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:37.280
don't.
So you skid to a stop.

2270
02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:41.570
He get out and you're involved in the biggest earthquake in recorded history and

2271
02:12:41.571 --> 02:12:43.790
then it Fukushima spouts,

2272
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:48.680
lack of volcano into the sky now all the reactors and not only blown,

2273
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:53.270
it creates some new reactor of its own deep in the bowels of the earth and it

2274
02:12:53.271 --> 02:12:56.690
mixes with lava.
Now I'm just making shit up.

2275
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:59.840
Just working with Don asshole.
Yeah.

2276
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:04.550
Imagine if like radio or nuclear reactors rather.
If when they went bad,

2277
02:13:04.551 --> 02:13:05.384
they exploded.

2278
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:10.510
They just shot fire into the sky like a big zit instead of just leaking into the

2279
02:13:11.931 --> 02:13:15.980
earth.
Fucking everything around them.
We need to do this quick though.

2280
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:20.360
Like seriously,
we need to definitely consider it and we should consider it.

2281
02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:24.980
Like when people talk about being preppers,
that's not going to do you any good.

2282
02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.630
If this is a real issue,

2283
02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.950
can you imagine if California had to get up and leave and what would be the next

2284
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:31.830
California like?

2285
02:13:31.831 --> 02:13:35.400
Oklahoma's the new California now be a real problem for resources,
man.

2286
02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:39.900
If be real poverty problem for a long fucking time because there's a lot of

2287
02:13:39.901 --> 02:13:42.630
people that are not equipped,
just pack up and move their stuff.

2288
02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:46.050
There's a lot of people,
you know they need the job they have here.

2289
02:13:46.050 --> 02:13:48.420
They don't have a savings,
they don't have food,

2290
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.860
and if they have to move to a new place,

2291
02:13:49.861 --> 02:13:54.120
they don't have rent money that there's not enough apartments or houses for

2292
02:13:54.121 --> 02:13:57.270
people.
You know.
You couldn't just take everyone on the west coast.

2293
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.550
The West Coast is probably California,
like Los Angeles,
San Francisco.

2294
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:07.950
They'll just,
those two alone have to have 30 million people.
Right.

2295
02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:09.950
If you had a gas,
what's the,
okay,
let's see,

2296
02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:14.220
what's pup population of California population.
I didn't know what this is from,

2297
02:14:14.221 --> 02:14:18.300
but somebody posted this on the forums.
Uh,
U s Navy Mapa Future America,

2298
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:21.600
Belize shows where the coastlines would be.
Did you see this?

2299
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.440
What does that supposedly as a US Navy map of future u s navy,

2300
02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:30.670
everybody please of says who though?
Like Ge,

2301
02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:32.930
like click on like does it,

2302
02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:37.931
does it have like a source Google us navy map of that's like a,

2303
02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:44.390
there's an old bill hex joke about California or Arizona Bay.
It was one of his,

2304
02:14:44.391 --> 02:14:47.720
uh,
one of his albums is titled that.
Yeah.
Okay.

2305
02:14:47.721 --> 02:14:52.460
The population is wow.
Ready for this?
2012 38 million,

2306
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:56.390
41,000,
430.
Fuck

2307
02:14:57.340 --> 02:14:58.110
<v 4>yeah.</v>

2308
02:14:58.110 --> 02:15:00.690
<v 2>That's a lot of people.
Where are they going to go?</v>

2309
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.610
That's like a whole country full of people.

2310
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.560
38 million folks and they'd all have to get out.
And then on top of that,

2311
02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:09.480
you'd have to get rid of all the people in Oregon.

2312
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:11.730
You have to get rid of all the people in Washington state.

2313
02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:15.360
You'd have to get rid of all the people in Alaska because they're going to take

2314
02:15:15.361 --> 02:15:18.660
it.
It's all going to go up by them first.
Everybody's fucked,

2315
02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.440
right?
We have spreaders of doom and gloom with zero science.

2316
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:28.970
I apologize folks.
I don't know if I'm right or wrong,

2317
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:30.890
but I know that scares the shit out of me.

2318
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:34.760
I don't even know if it should scare the shit out of me.

2319
02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.110
A lot of people are saying that maps fake.
So of course that maps fake.

2320
02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:43.730
God dammit.
If the fuck does the navy know that geologists don't,

2321
02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:46.220
it says navy.
It's got to be right.

2322
02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:48.830
Our boys wouldn't lie to us when they're out there,

2323
02:15:48.831 --> 02:15:50.780
but fucking under some mergeable boat a,

2324
02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:54.440
they wouldn't lie to us about the future contours of the United States.

2325
02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:59.750
She's this captain.
Did you really do that?
Your instincts were so bad.

2326
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:04.820
So have you been looking at any of the leaks of what Apple's about to announce

2327
02:16:04.821 --> 02:16:09.020
on September 10th no,
it wasn't going to be another phone.
Whoa.

2328
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:13.790
Like a blueprint.
A thumbprint scan.
Yeah,
but it's no bigger.
Not Bigger.

2329
02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:17.800
Yeah,
they fucked up.
They fucked up.
Okay.
Bigger stuff.

2330
02:16:17.801 --> 02:16:19.850
Samsung got them by the Deq.

2331
02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:23.480
They got them by the Dick with that giant ass phone that dies in like three

2332
02:16:23.481 --> 02:16:24.890
seconds,
doesn't die in three seconds.

2333
02:16:24.890 --> 02:16:27.860
The battery life is good battery life for that Galaxy s four is supposed to be

2334
02:16:27.861 --> 02:16:28.694
very good.

2335
02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:32.950
The the number one problem with the galaxy s four seems to be people are upset

2336
02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:36.790
with providers software,
the shit that you get when you get it,

2337
02:16:36.791 --> 02:16:38.920
like if you get it from at and t or whoever,

2338
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:43.270
they add a bunch of stupid shit easy for whom maybe easier for you.

2339
02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:45.760
Dummies like me don't want to do that.

2340
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:47.170
They just want to pick up a phone and go with it.

2341
02:16:47.171 --> 02:16:48.670
That's why the iPhone is perfect,

2342
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:52.000
but they're fucking up with these little flimsy ass screens.

2343
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:53.230
I see people with that.

2344
02:16:53.231 --> 02:16:58.231
Galaxy s four and I get all drooly incident note note three son bigger yet.

2345
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.740
I think it comes out real soon.
Let's stay.
Galaxy note three.
Yeah.

2346
02:17:02.741 --> 02:17:05.350
The girl I've been hanging out live with lately has a note and I'm always so

2347
02:17:05.351 --> 02:17:08.470
jealous of it because their insurance on an extra sketch.
Sure.
She's got three.

2348
02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:12.250
The cameras the best on the note too.

2349
02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:16.870
I don't know if you've ever seen the camera.
It's great.
Yeah,
that's amazing.
Okay,

2350
02:17:16.871 --> 02:17:21.420
so it says us release date
breakdown.

2351
02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:25.810
It says the launch date arrives tomorrow and that was today.

2352
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:30.400
So,
um,
so tomorrow and they'll know quite a bit about the,
uh,

2353
02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:35.620
the,
the new one,
but they're saying that it's going to be 5.68 inches.

2354
02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:38.830
Jesus Christ.
Oh,
ready for this?

2355
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:43.840
It can record in that Oh four k?
Yes.

2356
02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:48.370
That new note.
Yes.
Oh,
snap.
Let's get some food.
Yeah,

2357
02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:53.420
we have the new a four k TV here that's been just playing puppies and Asians and

2358
02:17:53.971 --> 02:17:55.300
then forecast.
Yeah.
Let me,
um,

2359
02:17:55.330 --> 02:17:58.900
let me pull this up and make sure that that's correct,
but I'm pretty sure it is.

2360
02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:03.880
That's true.
I'm,
I'm sure it records in a very high definition video.

2361
02:18:04.390 --> 02:18:07.560
Some signals that,
let me see what it says.
This one was a preorder or g.

2362
02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:12.160
G Jujitsu.
Okay.
Let me see.
Galaxy note three video.
Oh my God,

2363
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:15.880
they have,
is tink still sponsor here?
No,
sometimes.
Okay.
Well,

2364
02:18:15.890 --> 02:18:20.230
I still have the galaxy s four purple.
I didn't know they made it purple foam.

2365
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:23.460
What does it mean?
It's a pair of Volvo.
It's just prayerful.
That's it.

2366
02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:27.520
I got sexy that galaxy notice.
Are you?
What do you print?
I like purple man.
I'm,

2367
02:18:27.590 --> 02:18:27.851
I'm,

2368
02:18:27.851 --> 02:18:30.700
I'm ended up pink and purple right now because for you sex and you don't like

2369
02:18:30.730 --> 02:18:33.280
[inaudible] off often wrong with it.
I said you were sexy.

2370
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:35.530
It's not one of the greatest things you could say about a person.

2371
02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.880
You are aware of?
Pink shirt.
Yeah,
sure it would.
I'm mailing,
is Fox on?

2372
02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:43.780
I wear a fanny pack.
You think it'd be afraid of pink.
Okay.

2373
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:46.390
Let's see where the video HD.

2374
02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:51.790
See it says here full HD screen.

2375
02:18:52.630 --> 02:18:56.230
Ultra HD four k four k video.
Yeah.

2376
02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:01.330
That's incredible.
It's on your phone.
We can make videos for this TV,

2377
02:19:02.650 --> 02:19:07.450
four K on your phone and there's a videos of it where it's been leaked.

2378
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:11.290
The size of this thing,
it's a pet tablet.
It's a fucking tablet.

2379
02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.140
Things giant for rising or anything that's going to be,

2380
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.320
it's going to be on everybody apparently.
I wonder if it's on right now.

2381
02:19:17.321 --> 02:19:21.610
It comes out today,
so no,
it comes out tomorrow.
Tonight at midnight.

2382
02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:25.630
You're going to be out there like a dork with a camp camp set up and let's Ting

2383
02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:29.210
ads and your dog happy with my iPhone.
I just,
where'd you skin it?

2384
02:19:29.211 --> 02:19:31.370
Where's your fucking dog?
Did you get rid of that thing yet?
No.

2385
02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:35.990
It's packed it away.
And you give it away?
No,
no,
no.
It's at home.

2386
02:19:35.991 --> 02:19:38.600
You don't talk about it anymore?
Well,
I used to be your pride and joy.

2387
02:19:38.601 --> 02:19:42.280
I love that board with it.
I love her.
I just,
uh,
I can't,

2388
02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:45.500
I don't want to bring her here.
She's a little distracting.
Yeah.

2389
02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:47.870
She takes giant shits on the floor.

2390
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:52.910
She doesn't pisses on toward Jamie when he's trying to work.
She,
he's on a Mat,

2391
02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:53.811
like the pee pad,

2392
02:19:53.811 --> 02:19:56.890
which is also great for if you're fucking a squirter or grown up here.

2393
02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.680
Shut the fuck up.
Disgusting.

2394
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:05.540
Pastors saw lady at the pet store yesterday that the cutest dog.
Who's a,
um,

2395
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:08.540
she has my dog.
No,
the cutest dog because my dog,

2396
02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.320
it was a American bulldog puppy.
Oh so adorable.

2397
02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:16.190
It was so adorable.
It was like 11 months old and it was really small.

2398
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:18.140
It wasn't gonna get much bigger.
It was just the cutest,

2399
02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:21.620
friendliest little white dog.
So beautiful.

2400
02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:26.720
So weird thing that puppies are so beautiful were so strange with animals.

2401
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:27.830
We have this,

2402
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:32.600
these animals that we sanction and then other ones that we don't and sometimes

2403
02:20:32.601 --> 02:20:36.590
we sanctioned them like you're allowed to have a pet pig or some people have pet

2404
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:37.424
deer.

2405
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:40.790
You know that girl I'm hanging out with that she has a pet pig and a pet deer

2406
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:45.020
and two of those,
three of those,
uh,
whether those cats,

2407
02:20:45.021 --> 02:20:47.960
the big giant real cats.
She live in an apartment in Hollywood.

2408
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:51.680
It was pet deer and pet pig desert.
Does she really?
She desert rat.

2409
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:56.250
Great place in the desert.
And so they have the best math out there.
Yes.

2410
02:20:56.251 --> 02:20:57.890
We want to go.
If you wanna be close to the Meth,

2411
02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:01.220
he don't want to be hiding in the city.

2412
02:21:01.221 --> 02:21:04.310
Cause then you have to like has to go and get distributed.

2413
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:06.320
You want and get it out there fresh from the source.

2414
02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:11.470
That's where the meth farmers are throw out there like in between Bakersfield

2415
02:21:11.961 --> 02:21:15.920
and San Francisco.
A man,

2416
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:18.590
they got me freaking out about this note.
They didn't have to get on Verizon.

2417
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:19.880
Well it's going to come out.

2418
02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:22.550
They're going to announce where it's going to be out tomorrow,
but uh,

2419
02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:27.140
it does look pretty delicious.
But um,
uh,
Chris Ryan just gone Tang.

2420
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:30.740
So many people that we recommended to with came back and said that it's a,

2421
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:35.990
I love my,
they're so happy about it.
They saved money since the,
um,
the signals.

2422
02:21:35.991 --> 02:21:39.980
Great people say that that sprint signal is fucking good man.
It's good.

2423
02:21:39.981 --> 02:21:41.570
I never had problem with someone.
I tink phone.

2424
02:21:41.571 --> 02:21:44.810
I have problems with the actual galaxy s three,

2425
02:21:44.811 --> 02:21:48.350
just all these dying,
but the battery life,

2426
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:50.720
it seems like this sucks it right out.

2427
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:54.860
Forced quite a bit better apparently for supposed to be a masterpiece that I

2428
02:21:54.861 --> 02:21:57.700
have that HTC one,
but I got from my friend at Google.
Yeah,

2429
02:21:58.740 --> 02:22:03.680
it's in my bag here and it's pretty slick.
The thing I like about the HTC one,

2430
02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:08.180
first of all is the way it looks.
They have,
they built it like an iPhone.

2431
02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:13.070
Like it's a complete solid one piece.
Apparently Verizon has this too.

2432
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:17.200
That's the music one right where it's got the speakers built into it.
Yeah.

2433
02:22:17.370 --> 02:22:21.080
That's the sweetest thing of all time when it comes to that.
But that's bad ass.

2434
02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:25.590
It's awesome.
Beaker here.
That one that you were hanging on to.
It's made for at t

2435
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.330
<v 0>and ACAC could basically socket.
I've done you before.</v>

2436
02:22:30.331 --> 02:22:35.160
I don't trust you.
Every time I drive around Hollywood would death thing.

2437
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:39.990
It fucking cuts out.
It just does at and t just cuts out everywhere and I,

2438
02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.920
it doesn't matter if a signal is a,

2439
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:44.250
if you have a better antenna or better cell phone,

2440
02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:46.410
it's just not as good as Verizon in my opinion.

2441
02:22:47.530 --> 02:22:50.640
<v 2>Well this screen is nice and everything.
I just,
you know,
I just can't get over</v>

2442
02:22:51.310 --> 02:22:55.360
<v 0>the software software.
Well that's the clearest,
the cleanest one.
Well you're,</v>

2443
02:22:55.361 --> 02:22:57.550
well you're holding onto right there is the Google version.

2444
02:22:57.730 --> 02:22:59.440
That's the one that comes straight from Google play.

2445
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:02.880
That doesn't have any bullshit on it.
That's an unlocked phone.
That's awesome.

2446
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:07.900
So that phone can go to any GSM provider.
And what,
um,
people who,
uh,

2447
02:23:07.930 --> 02:23:12.130
don't know about these phones.
There's a GSM and CDMA.

2448
02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:15.130
CDMA is veraison and it's also sprint.

2449
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:18.540
And GSM is essentially worldwide.

2450
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:23.340
It's very few countries that I've ever been to other than Canada that have a,

2451
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:27.730
uh,
a CDMA signal.
Most of Europe is on GSM,

2452
02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.870
like England.
When you go to England,
they're all on that.

2453
02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:33.460
Japan is all on that.

2454
02:23:33.490 --> 02:23:38.490
They're all on a different version of a cell phone.

2455
02:23:38.531 --> 02:23:42.040
But most of these new phones,
they're,
uh,
like the,

2456
02:23:42.041 --> 02:23:46.720
the Nice GSM phones or the Nice Cdma phones from Verizon or world phones,

2457
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:50.410
like the,
I phones a world phone,
so it has a GSM chip in it.

2458
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:54.670
So when you go to Japan and when you go to somewhere else that only has GSM,

2459
02:23:54.671 --> 02:23:56.530
it's still works.
Yeah.

2460
02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:01.210
<v 2>I,
uh,
I'm excited though about September for the announcements for apple because</v>

2461
02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:04.330
they're supposedly,
no,
but because you're an apple dark,

2462
02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:08.140
I know that they're making that the cheaper iPhone this time to also,

2463
02:24:08.141 --> 02:24:11.770
supposedly they're having a cheaper plastic version or I say having a gold

2464
02:24:11.771 --> 02:24:14.470
version supposedly.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
bitches.

2465
02:24:14.530 --> 02:24:19.480
But I wonder if also to shine the IPAD mini,

2466
02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:22.930
I wonder if they're going to try to make it like a galaxy note phone with the

2467
02:24:22.931 --> 02:24:25.390
options to have a phone that hasn't really been talked about much.

2468
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:29.110
They would be copying and I think that's one of the reasons why they haven't

2469
02:24:29.111 --> 02:24:29.980
gone with a bigger screen.

2470
02:24:29.981 --> 02:24:32.650
I think they're being stubborn that they're the innovators.
This is,

2471
02:24:32.651 --> 02:24:36.840
we found that this size is perfect.
It's perfect for your hands.
You know,

2472
02:24:36.841 --> 02:24:39.880
you can use it with one hand very easily and that is true,

2473
02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.360
but I use the battery pack on it,
which makes it larger anyway.
Right.

2474
02:24:43.361 --> 02:24:46.510
With the battery pack,
it's basically the same size as this,

2475
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:49.270
but without the sexy screen.
Yeah,

2476
02:24:49.420 --> 02:24:52.730
because this screen is undeniably socks that you cannot fuck with that.
Did.

2477
02:24:52.780 --> 02:24:56.470
You just can't look at that.
Come on son.
That's things gigantic.

2478
02:24:56.471 --> 02:25:01.471
Die and look Kapowwe like I can get on websites with chrome socket son.

2479
02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:02.921
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

2480
02:25:02.921 --> 02:25:07.300
But why don't you just get a mini iPad then if you went to the phone as well?

2481
02:25:07.330 --> 02:25:10.180
Yeah,
but I mean you could,
I can text on it.
I can put it in my pocket.

2482
02:25:10.181 --> 02:25:13.720
I can take pictures.
I can watch movies on it.
It's a better screen.
Yeah,

2483
02:25:13.721 --> 02:25:17.110
but why don't you for it just for a phone,
for phone.

2484
02:25:17.111 --> 02:25:19.680
Get like one of those flip phones that you could put it in your sock.
Blue.

2485
02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:20.290
<v 0>Blue Blades.</v>

2486
02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:22.960
You have two things where you could have one that does it go both better?

2487
02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:24.430
That doesn't make any sense.

2488
02:25:24.431 --> 02:25:28.190
Why wouldn't I just have this cause you cause I can go online on this screen.

2489
02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:30.190
It's not a preposterous experience.

2490
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:33.640
There's something preposterous about scrolling side to side and an iPhone trying

2491
02:25:33.641 --> 02:25:37.600
to look at a whole website.
It just is this,
you don't have to do it as much.

2492
02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:40.720
And it's,
in my opinion,
apple fucked up.

2493
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.990
I think they fucked up hardcore that they didn't develop a five inch screen.

2494
02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:46.620
Develop a five inch screen.
You fucking assholes.

2495
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:50.380
It's been three years since the android people showed you that that's something

2496
02:25:50.381 --> 02:25:54.010
desirable and you dummies like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
People are quite fine.

2497
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:58.270
They're very narrow.
Smaller one.
If it's in your pocket a little bit,
it's okay.

2498
02:25:58.300 --> 02:25:59.920
It's really good.
It works better.

2499
02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.550
It has the best software and as the best like interface.

2500
02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:06.460
The user interface of the iPhone is without a doubt the best experience,

2501
02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:09.280
but this little tiny screen could suck it all right.

2502
02:26:09.281 --> 02:26:13.360
This is stupid compared to this.
This is better.
This one I like better.

2503
02:26:13.361 --> 02:26:15.700
It's just a teeny bit of shutting the mouse on it.

2504
02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:18.910
You're talking about your mouth,
son.
You're talking about a very minor,

2505
02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.380
I'm talking things size.
Yeah.

2506
02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:26.320
Got a bag and it's not worth this software.
Its software's not that bad man.

2507
02:26:26.321 --> 02:26:29.790
I'm telling you this.
This,
you haven't tried this.
First of all,
this,

2508
02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:32.890
you don't know this one.
This is the one that has the only the Google shit.

2509
02:26:33.310 --> 02:26:35.980
It doesn't have any sprint shit.
Your set sprint when you started up

2510
02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:42.220
does against French shit on yours,
your sis Britain when he started up sun.

2511
02:26:42.250 --> 02:26:43.510
This one does not say sprint.

2512
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.660
I know that's bad that this is what I'm talking to you about.
Well My,
my,

2513
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:50.590
my ting one does say sprint,
but I'd hardly use that.
I love it.

2514
02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:52.450
I love it for pictures and videos though.

2515
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.980
But the three I'm thinking about going with the four for um,

2516
02:26:57.010 --> 02:26:58.810
from my regular phone.
I'm going to try that.

2517
02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.490
I'm gonna try to galaxy s four for regular phone on Verizon.
I tried that.

2518
02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:07.770
How long did you try it for?
Two days.
I tried it.
I'm like,

2519
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:11.020
I was all gung Ho.
I was like,
fuck.
Yeah.
Well listen man,

2520
02:27:11.050 --> 02:27:15.370
I saw Jay z and a video and he's using it.
So,
uh,
it's good enough for me.

2521
02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:18.190
Plus Jay z's a winter and a kind of feel like a winner.

2522
02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:22.330
I'm a winner if I'm using the same devices chassis.
That's how I feel.

2523
02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:27.580
Oh,
H to the O.
V I used to row snow flakes by the O.
Z.

2524
02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:31.900
Have you seen the video where he goes into an art gallery?

2525
02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.300
Speaking of our guy and he does wrap it in an art gallery.

2526
02:27:35.301 --> 02:27:39.070
We pull that up because it's kind of fascinating.
Have you seen it?

2527
02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:40.630
It's fascinating.

2528
02:27:44.810 --> 02:27:47.170
It is like something you'll go on and do it.
Look at this,
Brian.

2529
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:50.890
Look how sexy all those apps.
Oh yeah,
look at that.

2530
02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:55.530
Oh,
you mean all of those inferior apps that are not shut your mouth,
son.

2531
02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:58.970
You know the fuck you're talking about.
Look at all the possible frames I have.

2532
02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:02.350
What are the windows that I can go to vine and look at somebody that has an

2533
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:04.820
android vines compared to an iPhone.
Suck it.

2534
02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:08.290
Look at all the customizations and I can do go on someone vines.

2535
02:28:08.291 --> 02:28:11.980
I don't find kid.
You need to find sun.
No son.
I don't need to do anything.

2536
02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.770
He's where it's at.
Wilson.
I'm overexposed as it is.

2537
02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:18.070
You know how I know I don't like me anymore.
I'm tired of hearing me.

2538
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.160
I hear me too much.
You hear me?
Every fucking UFC.

2539
02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.190
You listened to your [inaudible]

2540
02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:26.750
<v 2>long when you get you again.
I'm gonna get Outta here
you go,</v>

2541
02:28:26.751 --> 02:28:28.860
boy.
I listened to myself.

2542
02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:34.280
<v 0>No,
I do have to on some occasions,
like for standup comedy,</v>

2543
02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:38.750
I don't listen to these things.
I do listen to criticism like a,

2544
02:28:38.751 --> 02:28:42.320
I know people don't want,
they don't believe that they think like,
uh,
you know,

2545
02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:47.320
nobody actually appreciates criticism when they,
uh,
do podcasts or anything.

2546
02:28:47.321 --> 02:28:52.321
While a large percentage of it is by people that just have an opinion and their

2547
02:28:55.281 --> 02:28:59.390
opinion is probably,
you know,
it's probably valid.
It is to them,

2548
02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:01.370
everybody's experience is different.

2549
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:03.950
There's things that certain people like about certain folks and their

2550
02:29:03.951 --> 02:29:05.600
personalities that other people don't like.

2551
02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:08.900
And when you take it all into consideration,

2552
02:29:08.901 --> 02:29:10.210
even if you don't agree with the guy,

2553
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:13.850
it gives you a broader perspective of what you're actually doing.
Of the,
the,

2554
02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:16.230
the point of view you're actually putting out or the,
uh,

2555
02:29:16.250 --> 02:29:19.550
the vibe people are actually receiving when they listened to the podcast.

2556
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:23.690
So even douchey criticisms have benefited me.

2557
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:27.920
I really believe that even like mean nasty.
I think it's,

2558
02:29:27.970 --> 02:29:31.670
it's a bitter pill to swallow,
but when you get through it,
I think it's,

2559
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.630
it benefits you.

2560
02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:35.960
You have a better understanding of what you are or aren't doing and it forces

2561
02:29:35.961 --> 02:29:39.290
you to look at what you are or aren't doing as a,
as a broadcaster,

2562
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:43.460
but you don't do it.
Yeah.
That's what you're looking at me like that.

2563
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:47.090
No idea what you're trying to say.
You're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Whatever.

2564
02:29:47.091 --> 02:29:48.410
Apple rules.

2565
02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:52.690
<v 2>That's what I was going to say about how creepy it would be to be at this Jay z</v>

2566
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:57.740
<v 11>art.
Oh,
creepy.
Yeah.
He comes up and starts rapping in your finger this,</v>

2567
02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.900
so they're at a gallery.
He's getting ready.

2568
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:04.100
I cut sleeves and this has something to do with the Samsung Galaxy s four right?

2569
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:07.160
I don't know.
Yeah,
doesn't it?

2570
02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:13.640
I believe it has something to do with the promotion and so he's standing there

2571
02:30:13.641 --> 02:30:18.641
and people and he's rapping in front of people and there's like old white ladies

2572
02:30:19.581 --> 02:30:20.414
dancing with them.

2573
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:24.770
She's like going head to head with them and dancing with them.

2574
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:27.320
That's a polite way of saying she would like that Dick.

2575
02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:36.920
<v 2>It makes you realize how an entertaining wrap really is.</v>

2576
02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:43.280
<v 11>I love,
what are you talking about?
All right now.
Okay.</v>

2577
02:30:43.281 --> 02:30:46.030
Let me ask you this.
I think difference between seeing this yes.

2578
02:30:46.210 --> 02:30:51.160
<v 2>And seeing the acoustic version of Everlast doing jump around.
Well,</v>

2579
02:30:51.161 --> 02:30:54.910
how about he wouldn't,
he did the John Lennon saw to work class hero.
Yeah.
Dude,

2580
02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:57.820
come on man.
That's just,
that's for that environment.

2581
02:30:58.090 --> 02:31:01.060
I've been listening to his new album.
It's bone chilling.
Shit's good.

2582
02:31:01.061 --> 02:31:05.260
But so depressing.
Yeah,
he's a depressant fucker.
He's lived a hard life.

2583
02:31:05.290 --> 02:31:09.770
He's got a bluesy outlook,
but you know if you ended that music,
he's a blue man.

2584
02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:14.110
He's a master at it.
He's a master at that Bluesy Shit.
Fuck yeah,
he's awesome.

2585
02:31:14.170 --> 02:31:16.780
He's a great guy too,
man.
I really enjoy having them in here.

2586
02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:21.180
He came to my shows in Toronto,
came to my show in Toronto.
It was awesome.

2587
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:24.120
He's a good dude.
He's so easy to hang with too.

2588
02:31:24.390 --> 02:31:28.380
Like he could just fit into any crowd.
He doesn't require any special attention.

2589
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:33.300
He just blends in that said that depressing ass music though.

2590
02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:40.200
The style.
It's,
he's very just,
you know,
it's voice sounds.
Yeah.

2591
02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:44.400
Yeah.
Everything is regret.
A lot of,
lot of loneliness in there.

2592
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:50.010
There's people loved that though.
They love like linking up to it,
you know?

2593
02:31:50.011 --> 02:31:55.011
That's why Johnny Cash Folsom prison blues is such a great song because it's

2594
02:31:55.471 --> 02:31:58.170
about a guy who ruined his whole fucking life.
You know,

2595
02:31:58.171 --> 02:32:03.171
you're singing about a guy who's watching people smoking big cigars and drinking

2596
02:32:04.351 --> 02:32:06.630
coffee and wishing he could be with them.

2597
02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:10.440
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars.

2598
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:15.020
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him.

2599
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:16.871
I mean,
that's,

2600
02:32:16.871 --> 02:32:19.860
there's something about like ruining your life that makes for great art.

2601
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:24.750
Why is that?
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck it is about blues music.

2602
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:27.900
There's something that people want to relate to about losing your life.

2603
02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:35.760
It's so funny.
Jamie says,
no,
you're doing a podcast right now.
Right there.

2604
02:32:35.761 --> 02:32:38.850
I'll change.
He's having his own little show.
What's he saying?

2605
02:32:38.890 --> 02:32:43.410
He says he's showing me a picture of what it looks like.
Jay Z,
uh,
looking at uh,

2606
02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:46.590
a galaxy s four,
and it just,
his expression on his face,
he's

2607
02:32:48.450 --> 02:32:51.330
like,
well he's just,
he's being um,

2608
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:53.940
like sponsored by galaxy s four.

2609
02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:58.530
And they actually like included his album on like a million different phones

2610
02:32:58.531 --> 02:33:00.580
that they sold.
It was like part of the uh,

2611
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:05.580
you could get the album early if he bought this phone.
Yes.
Yes.
Be on it.
Yeah.

2612
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:11.030
And so like people disputed that as far as like record sales go like how many,

2613
02:33:11.430 --> 02:33:14.100
how many records did you really sell then?
A man,

2614
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:17.310
this shit ain't no iPhone dog for reals.

2615
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.130
We're come on son.
Did you steal that from,

2616
02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:23.370
is that an ass Ford as Han or is that an iPhone?
It looks like an iPhone.

2617
02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:25.980
It looks like an Iphone,
isn't it?
They got them.
They call.

2618
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:30.120
That's what the photo is about.
If you have a,
a big contract with s four.
Yeah,

2619
02:33:30.121 --> 02:33:33.300
you can't be seen fucking with an iPhone.
Someone could take a picture of it.

2620
02:33:33.301 --> 02:33:34.710
The Hey man,
look at this picture.

2621
02:33:34.711 --> 02:33:38.280
They give you their phone to look at and then the Paparazzi snap a shot real

2622
02:33:38.281 --> 02:33:40.920
quick and boom,
iPhone goes,

2623
02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:45.210
let's be real Jay z when no one's looking.
This is what you use

2624
02:33:47.390 --> 02:33:49.220
and that's true.
That's what it seems like it.

2625
02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:54.000
I'm sure that's what you're going to,
you're,
you're,
you should go just galaxy.

2626
02:33:54.001 --> 02:33:56.340
I would love,
what are you talking about man?
I'm not sponsored by nobody.

2627
02:33:56.341 --> 02:33:57.720
I can do whatever the fuck I want.
I know,

2628
02:33:57.721 --> 02:34:00.540
but that's what I'm saying is you should try to do as if you were sponsored,

2629
02:34:00.541 --> 02:34:03.570
see if you could do it here to put these glasses on.
Why would I do that?

2630
02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:06.600
These classes?
No,
not wearing those glasses and see if they help.
You know,

2631
02:34:06.610 --> 02:34:07.800
I read with glasses,

2632
02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.820
I read with a reading glasses would be cool if you had like red glasses.
No.

2633
02:34:12.210 --> 02:34:14.970
If I want to read a book and low light and have to use reading glasses,

2634
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.130
but I can read my uh,
my laptop.
You know,
the what,
what

2635
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:23.020
<v 0>gets me is low light conditions.
Like I can read really good.
Like,
if I'm outside,</v>

2636
02:34:23.021 --> 02:34:26.440
I could read a book with no problem.
I don't need a,
uh,
uh,
even glasses,

2637
02:34:26.441 --> 02:34:30.250
reading glasses.
Is driving been affected yet?
No,
no.

2638
02:34:30.251 --> 02:34:33.730
Driving doesn't get affected.
It's,
Steve Graham explained it to me.

2639
02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:38.970
He's an ophthalmologist and he said that it's a you or your brain or your,

2640
02:34:38.971 --> 02:34:43.360
your eyeballs rather they lose their ability to focus.
The muscle doesn't,

2641
02:34:43.450 --> 02:34:48.010
doesn't focus on in close things anymore and you develop near sightedness.

2642
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:50.920
That's something that people,
that's wear reading glasses come from.

2643
02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:55.200
<v 3>That's why my dad always told me to spend like 10 minutes every hour and look at</v>

2644
02:34:55.290 --> 02:34:57.960
a mountain far away.
Just if you're on your computer,

2645
02:34:57.961 --> 02:35:01.410
just go outside and stare at something far away,
cut to,
to uh,

2646
02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:05.650
kind of work out that muscle into stretching out or seeing far away and seeing

2647
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:06.370
close up.

2648
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:08.350
<v 0>Makes Sense.
It makes sense that your,</v>

2649
02:35:08.470 --> 02:35:11.500
your muscle would get tired of doing the same thing over and over and over
again.

2650
02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:13.840
You just abusing it.
Yep.
It's also,

2651
02:35:13.841 --> 02:35:16.240
I think there's probably an issue with artificial light.

2652
02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:19.570
It's probably an issue with artificial light.
While you're looking at,

2653
02:35:19.571 --> 02:35:22.900
look at this motherfucker with an iPhone.
Jesus Christ,
Jz,

2654
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:25.840
Jesus Christ,
and he got the iPhone,

2655
02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:30.160
one of the white one white one black people of white limos like Eddie Griffin

2656
02:35:30.161 --> 02:35:32.680
used to love white limos,
get white linen white shoes.

2657
02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.780
I want to be taken around by,
I'll wipe them out.

2658
02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:38.450
You know they're all going to jump on that gold though.
That gold gold iPhone.

2659
02:35:38.530 --> 02:35:41.140
The other reason apple is releasing it,
if they do release it,

2660
02:35:41.141 --> 02:35:44.470
that is a smart move for the hip hop community.
You definitely want to get that.

2661
02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:45.751
They,

2662
02:35:45.751 --> 02:35:50.710
you said they had an a gold iPhone five that they gave away as a prize and one

2663
02:35:50.711 --> 02:35:51.820
of the MMA events,

2664
02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:56.880
I forget like one of the foreign MMA events.
I gave a,

2665
02:35:56.890 --> 02:36:00.610
I think they gave Paul Daley Gold iPhone.
That's nice.

2666
02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:05.740
It's silly,
right?
I mean,
what the fuck are you doing?
What if you lose it?

2667
02:36:05.741 --> 02:36:06.970
You're going to be so bummed out.

2668
02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:12.880
Lose your fucking stupid gold iPhone.
Drop your stupid goal life on this.

2669
02:36:12.881 --> 02:36:16.210
Well then we're going to do take the back off of it and put it on some new

2670
02:36:16.211 --> 02:36:19.510
innards.
You don't have to get some doctor work done.

2671
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:22.240
<v 3>Supposedly Apple's about to release it like a new,</v>

2672
02:36:22.241 --> 02:36:25.720
a warranty program that gives you uh,
you know,

2673
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:30.220
for two years your iPhone is protected up to two accidental damage things.

2674
02:36:30.221 --> 02:36:34.450
So like if you cracks on the ground now it's like hundreds of dollars to get,

2675
02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:39.010
you know,
it's not that,
but the new one's gonna let you have two cracks.
Really?

2676
02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:40.330
Yeah.
So two swipes.
Yeah.

2677
02:36:40.331 --> 02:36:43.600
So now I might not even be using cases anymore cause it's a sexy without the

2678
02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:43.770
cake.

2679
02:36:43.770 --> 02:36:45.810
<v 0>It's,
it's very sexy about the case.
But you know,</v>

2680
02:36:45.811 --> 02:36:47.700
I started using this mophie case thing.

2681
02:36:47.730 --> 02:36:51.470
That's the shit because you always have a second battery option.
Yeah.

2682
02:36:51.850 --> 02:36:53.580
There's nothing better than that man.

2683
02:36:53.790 --> 02:36:57.990
The idea that you can just charge that bitch up at any point in time

2684
02:36:58.190 --> 02:37:02.600
<v 3>except the plug.
It's a plug.
Except the plug difference meaning not different.</v>

2685
02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.460
You have to charge different anymore.
Oh it's not,
no,
no USB plug use.

2686
02:37:07.461 --> 02:37:12.120
If you have the micro USB,
it plugs this and it plugs the phone.
It charges bowl.

2687
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:15.140
That's how it always was.
I'm talking about like,
like you know like Oh,

2688
02:37:15.141 --> 02:37:16.100
if you want to take the case

2689
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:19.790
<v 2>off and yeah,
yeah,
that's true.
But if you want to charge it,</v>

2690
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:24.120
it charges both the phone and the case with the um,

2691
02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:27.890
a mini USB or micro USB or whatever it is.
I think that's,
what does it say?

2692
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:32.160
He sitting there with apple laptops.
Oh,
how dare you,
Jay Z,

2693
02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.170
you're allowed to have an apple laptop.
If you have a Samsung,

2694
02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:38.450
you don't have to use windows.
You know,

2695
02:37:38.451 --> 02:37:40.010
Google's coming out with their own desktop.

2696
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:44.960
They don't have their own laptops now.
Yeah,
I know.
No fucking hard drives at all.

2697
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:47.690
They want you to store everything in the cloud.
Such a dumb idea.

2698
02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:53.060
This idea of the cloud being for everything.
Yep.
Get out of my face.
What if,

2699
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:57.080
anyway,
I don't have an Internet access.
I can't fucking write my paper or,
well,

2700
02:37:57.081 --> 02:37:57.621
not only that,

2701
02:37:57.621 --> 02:38:00.140
I haven't really clearly established at the NSA is looking through everything

2702
02:38:00.141 --> 02:38:03.160
that you do.
The NSA is going to have your cloud,
you know,

2703
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:08.000
is Google going to protect your cloud from the NSA?
Really?
Sure.
No.
Where am I?

2704
02:38:08.001 --> 02:38:11.390
Dick pictures going.
They're going out into the universe.

2705
02:38:12.350 --> 02:38:16.550
I don't think it's a good idea to just store stuff in space like that unless you

2706
02:38:16.551 --> 02:38:17.360
don't care.

2707
02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:19.730
But if you have anything that's like intellectual property and like something

2708
02:38:19.731 --> 02:38:20.564
you're working on,

2709
02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:23.750
a movie that you're trying to do and you're storing it in the cloud or or

2710
02:38:23.751 --> 02:38:27.320
anything along those lines.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I think,

2711
02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:31.040
I think it's fine for most shit,
but I'm not going to put it on my bubble photos.

2712
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:35.180
I'm loud.
Oh,
I get it.
I said Dick.
And you say bottle.
Yeah.
It's funny.

2713
02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:40.760
Fucking child grow up.
Let's bring this thing home.

2714
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:44.210
You haven't changed in three years.

2715
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:46.670
Why did you think it was actually there by the way?

2716
02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:52.160
I said we're closing in on episode 100 it's episode 389 isn't that ridiculous?

2717
02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:57.810
Yeah.
Oh,
I wrote 400 that's right.
That's hilarious.
Oh,

2718
02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:01.610
I wrote it.
You know why?
Because it was talking and writing at the same time.

2719
02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:06.260
Yeah.
Edit it.
Edit the thread.
Um,

2720
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:11.950
it's kind of amazing that it's almost at 489 super crazy.

2721
02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:15.560
If you stop buying,
think about the old days,

2722
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:18.500
the old days of the snowflakes.

2723
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:22.550
The next stage of this shit is that we don't have to be in the same room.

2724
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:26.050
The next stage of this is that we to be in other parts of the country where to

2725
02:39:26.051 --> 02:39:28.460
Skype it in together.
I could already do that.
Yeah.

2726
02:39:28.490 --> 02:39:30.980
We were going to have to do that eventually because I'm not going to stay here.

2727
02:39:31.430 --> 02:39:33.800
Well,
I'm not going to stay every now that all those La Shit,

2728
02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:39.030
you mean radiation shit.
Yeah.
I'm,
I wasn't going to stay anyway.
I think the,
uh,

2729
02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.780
the traffic situation here is problematic.

2730
02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:44.120
The culture situation here is problematic.

2731
02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:46.160
There's a lot of things about this place I don't like.

2732
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:49.940
One of the big ones is I think there's too many people and I think,
uh,

2733
02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:52.700
I think we devalue each other when we're there.

2734
02:39:52.701 --> 02:39:56.090
We're stuck in these places where there's too many people like this.

2735
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:57.740
There's think the numbers are too high.

2736
02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:01.850
Well that in the fact that 90% of the people out here are trying to be somebody

2737
02:40:01.851 --> 02:40:03.890
or something,
so you're not getting normal people.

2738
02:40:03.891 --> 02:40:07.640
You're getting people that are usually like in the broken.
Yeah,
we're not broken.

2739
02:40:07.641 --> 02:40:09.590
Even like,
like when you go to high school,

2740
02:40:09.591 --> 02:40:14.070
you know who's in the Thespian club and who's in the the normal club.
Well,
you

2741
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:18.150
<v 0>know what,
look man,
there's a lot of people that are into that that I like.</v>

2742
02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:21.510
You know,
there's not,
that's not all bad.
What's the bad?

2743
02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:23.580
To me it's not being into being a thespian.

2744
02:40:23.581 --> 02:40:28.581
What's bad to me is the desire for really unnecessary attention or undeserved at

2745
02:40:31.171 --> 02:40:32.130
attention,
I should say.

2746
02:40:32.490 --> 02:40:35.910
Where there's so many people that are trying to correct what they feel is an

2747
02:40:35.911 --> 02:40:37.890
injustice from their childhood.

2748
02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:42.240
That's what creates someone who wants to be famous.
That's what created me.

2749
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:43.290
No doubt about it.

2750
02:40:43.770 --> 02:40:48.150
I had to try to work my way through that and figure it out as an adult and

2751
02:40:48.151 --> 02:40:52.200
adjust and evolve and I did it through martial arts and I did it through

2752
02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.850
reflection and meditation and isolation tanks and all that shit and

2753
02:40:56.851 --> 02:41:00.330
psychedelics,
but some people aren't interested in fixing it.

2754
02:41:00.570 --> 02:41:03.430
They're not interested in being balanced there.

2755
02:41:03.470 --> 02:41:07.170
They're interested in feeding the monster and the monster was developed when

2756
02:41:07.171 --> 02:41:09.990
they were children.
Almost everyone out here too.

2757
02:41:09.991 --> 02:41:14.991
A person has a fucked up childhood and I don't know if that's almost everyone in

2758
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:20.550
America because it seems like there's a good percentage of people when you get

2759
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:22.530
down to the nitty gritty and talk to them about the childhood,

2760
02:41:22.531 --> 02:41:23.970
there's a lot of shit they weren't happy about.

2761
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:25.830
There's a lot of shit that could have been done differently,

2762
02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.510
but the opposite of that of course is that those are the most interesting people

2763
02:41:30.511 --> 02:41:34.350
I know.
The most interesting people I know all had fucked up childhoods.

2764
02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:37.380
They all had to form their own opinions of the world.

2765
02:41:37.530 --> 02:41:42.390
They all had to escape the pressure or the,
the,
the,

2766
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:46.290
the gravity of their environment and get out and,

2767
02:41:46.390 --> 02:41:50.550
and become their own individual.
And in doing so,
they developed four to two.

2768
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:51.630
They develop character,

2769
02:41:51.631 --> 02:41:56.631
the developed creativity that some people who live in a soft,

2770
02:41:56.761 --> 02:41:59.850
cushy,
nerfed environment don't have to develop.

2771
02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:05.300
So it's almost like shielding your children from adversity can punish them in a

2772
02:42:05.521 --> 02:42:06.354
way.

2773
02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:11.540
It's almost like the only way to actually have an interesting person or develop

2774
02:42:12.111 --> 02:42:15.540
it,
entering interesting persons.
They have to develop,
they have to fail.

2775
02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:19.260
They have to try and fail and then learn why they failed and then overcome and

2776
02:42:19.261 --> 02:42:22.230
then deal with assholes to learn.
They don't like assholes to learn,

2777
02:42:22.231 --> 02:42:24.810
not to become an asshole.
See other people with you.

2778
02:42:24.811 --> 02:42:27.090
Don't want to see in yourself.
Correct that from yourself.

2779
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:31.440
And there's like a long fucking process to making a good person.
And if you,

2780
02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.870
you know,
if a kid just grows up in Beverly hills are Brown,

2781
02:42:33.871 --> 02:42:38.790
a bunch of snots and they're all just doing Adderall all day and driving their

2782
02:42:38.791 --> 02:42:40.470
dad's BMW,
you know,

2783
02:42:40.471 --> 02:42:43.940
you might develop a bunch of useless fucking human beings that are never going

2784
02:42:43.941 --> 02:42:45.090
to be able to fix themselves.

2785
02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:50.190
But if you develop in a community where hard work is cherished and people

2786
02:42:50.191 --> 02:42:52.800
understand adversity and they appreciate,
you know,

2787
02:42:52.801 --> 02:42:56.400
the land that they're living on,
like a,
a cool community,

2788
02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:59.690
a community that has a good,
like a good,
um,

2789
02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:04.260
farmer's market community that people,
you know,
they,

2790
02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:05.790
they appreciate being there.

2791
02:43:05.850 --> 02:43:09.930
They work to keep environmental damage from happening to them.

2792
02:43:09.931 --> 02:43:12.190
They work to not pollute their work,
to

2793
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:15.550
<v 2>establish like a good area,
a good spot for everybody to enjoy.</v>

2794
02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:17.410
That I think is the best way to do it.

2795
02:43:18.850 --> 02:43:20.980
But it's just once you live in a place,

2796
02:43:20.981 --> 02:43:25.270
it's so hard to get the fuck out really is so hard and he becomes harder when

2797
02:43:25.271 --> 02:43:27.230
you get older,
especially if you have children,
you know,

2798
02:43:27.250 --> 02:43:28.840
your children love the school they go to,

2799
02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:31.090
they love their friends and you're like,
hey,
yeah.

2800
02:43:31.091 --> 02:43:33.370
You know that person that you love more than anything in life.
Yeah.

2801
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:34.390
You're not going to get to see her.

2802
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:38.550
But maybe once or twice a year cause we're gonna pack up and move to Texas.
Yeah.

2803
02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:42.840
But usually,
I mean usually gets better,
you know,
whence United like,

2804
02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:44.740
have you ever moved somewhere?
I'm like,
man,

2805
02:43:44.741 --> 02:43:47.290
I wasn't as good as when I moved over.
You know,
live it there.

2806
02:43:47.291 --> 02:43:50.320
It's usually always like getting a new girlfriend.
Yeah.
You're always going up.

2807
02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:56.080
Usually moving down.
Well,
for me,
yes.
Um,
Colorado was a big,

2808
02:43:56.081 --> 02:43:59.920
I love Colorado.
I loved living there,
but there's a lot of,
you know,

2809
02:43:59.921 --> 02:44:02.710
when you have little kids and you're on mountain lions are eating dogs,

2810
02:44:03.470 --> 02:44:07.030
something fucked up about that.
It's something selfish,
man.

2811
02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:11.440
There's something really selfish about that.
On one hand it's like,
yeah,

2812
02:44:11.441 --> 02:44:13.060
well they're going to be okay if you look after them.

2813
02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:16.600
And the other hand it's like they might not be,
you know,

2814
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:20.430
you don't want a baby getting scooped up by an eagle.
Yeah.

2815
02:44:20.730 --> 02:44:22.140
You'd feel like such an asshole.

2816
02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:25.660
You don't want to be snowed in and you can't get groceries or help.

2817
02:44:26.010 --> 02:44:30.130
That can happen.
That happens.
That happens in Denver once every decade or so.

2818
02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:33.090
They get some shit that keeps you in your house for like two weeks.
Yeah.

2819
02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:36.050
Fuck that.
They got seven feet of snow once.

2820
02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:39.010
Stop and think about that.

2821
02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:44.290
A fucking storm just planted itself over Denver or boulder,

2822
02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:48.580
I forgot where it was and just dropped seven feet of snow and these poor people

2823
02:44:48.581 --> 02:44:49.660
were just fucked.

2824
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:53.380
The only good thing is you can melt it and drink it so you don't,

2825
02:44:53.410 --> 02:44:58.280
you don't have dehydration problems.
You totally drink that water.
Oh,

2826
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:02.830
what the fuck?
So I posted something of the Galaxy Mega.
Oh yeah.

2827
02:45:02.831 --> 02:45:03.940
That's another thing they're doing.

2828
02:45:04.210 --> 02:45:08.440
The galaxy mega is like in between a tablet and the uh,
the note three,

2829
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:13.060
that's going to be a 6.8 inches.
Is that what it is?
6.3,

2830
02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.140
6.3 inches.
That's for like guys like,
uh,

2831
02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.670
like Shaq.
Shaq could really have that no problem.
This giant hands.

2832
02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:23.500
See people say that,
um,

2833
02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:29.160
this is too big for one person for your one hand and I don't feel like it is,

2834
02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:33.130
I don't feel like,
uh,
the HTC one is too big for one hand.

2835
02:45:33.490 --> 02:45:35.350
I feel like they're going to handle that one hand,

2836
02:45:35.470 --> 02:45:39.790
no problems but driving and be,
I don't text and drive.

2837
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:42.820
You fuckhead you should stop doing that man.

2838
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.710
Here's what you can do easier with this.

2839
02:45:44.711 --> 02:45:47.410
You put the pinky underneath and it kind of does fit a little bit better in your

2840
02:45:47.411 --> 02:45:50.710
hand,
but you're awesome with a mophie.
You're using their,
their keyboard,

2841
02:45:50.711 --> 02:45:53.730
which is not as good.
I think that's great.
Keyboard's great keywords.

2842
02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:58.030
Keyword is just as good and the spell corrections.
Excellent.

2843
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:59.870
You haven't used this,
this is your,

2844
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:03.370
this is the thing about apple as opposed to a android.

2845
02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:08.170
One thing that they do lose on is there innovation is so far behind like as far

2846
02:46:08.171 --> 02:46:13.171
as like how much better new stuff is and how much they release these HTC phones

2847
02:46:13.311 --> 02:46:15.560
and these Samsung phones,
they're releasing them every couple of months,

2848
02:46:15.561 --> 02:46:17.570
like bad ass new ones with crazy new shit.

2849
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:20.510
And then another one's coming down the pipe there in the middle of developing
it.

2850
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:22.920
I definitely think they should expand their line to multiple funds,

2851
02:46:22.921 --> 02:46:25.070
which I think they're finally in doing now with this new,

2852
02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:27.860
like they're making the cheaper phone and maybe they might even make you talking

2853
02:46:27.861 --> 02:46:31.500
about apple.
So that's your team.
You just immediately go,
they,
hey man.
Hey,

2854
02:46:31.501 --> 02:46:33.470
you're talking about apple cause that's what's close to your heart.

2855
02:46:33.471 --> 02:46:36.350
I just liked the best,
you know,
I'm not good at Microsoft.

2856
02:46:36.351 --> 02:46:37.480
There was an article on a,

2857
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:41.840
I forget what website it was on today without Microsoft flailing,
uh,

2858
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:44.480
that they don't know what to do because they're,
they're new desktops.

2859
02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.310
What's that?
They bought Nokia Important Nokia guys.
They're probably like,
no,

2860
02:46:49.311 --> 02:46:51.770
you leave us alone.
Window is,
what are you talking about?

2861
02:46:51.771 --> 02:46:53.380
They want to get that money.
They're like,

2862
02:46:53.390 --> 02:46:57.530
good and you take are fucking dying platform here by it.
Please.
Thank you.

2863
02:46:57.560 --> 02:46:59.780
Give us the money.
We're done with the mobile market.

2864
02:46:59.781 --> 02:47:02.780
President of the company is leaving next year.
Now it's,
you know why?

2865
02:47:02.781 --> 02:47:07.520
Cause he's got a yacht the size of a state and it's just filled with hookers and

2866
02:47:07.521 --> 02:47:09.410
he's just rubbing his palms all day.

2867
02:47:09.411 --> 02:47:14.150
White works waiting for the one day he gets off and he gets to fucking dive into

2868
02:47:14.151 --> 02:47:18.380
this sea of beautiful prostitutes naked with $100 billion.

2869
02:47:18.381 --> 02:47:22.580
He made selling it to Microsoft,
Microsoft,
their um,

2870
02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:26.300
their phones are terrible.
I tried one of those windows phones.
I was like,
Jesus,

2871
02:47:26.301 --> 02:47:28.890
this is dog shit.
It's just so cool.

2872
02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:32.840
A friend of mine had one and he was trying to take a picture.

2873
02:47:32.841 --> 02:47:35.160
We were outside of the Ice House and he's tried to take a picture.
I call,

2874
02:47:35.161 --> 02:47:38.620
what are you doing with that monstrosity?
And he's like,
no,
no,
no.

2875
02:47:38.621 --> 02:47:41.400
This is cool man.
He's like,
let me show you.
Let me show you what,

2876
02:47:41.410 --> 02:47:44.480
once you get the hang of it and he's like,
okay,
now it's here.
Nope,
hold on.

2877
02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:49.610
Where is it?
Uh,
yeah,
I to get the camera,
I got to,
okay.
He ain't and I was like,

2878
02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:51.770
oh my God,
to show me his picture.

2879
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:55.850
He had to go through this whole rig tomorrow and go into his photo gallery.
I go,

2880
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.690
you just lost me.
You lost me in.
That is shite.

2881
02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:01.550
You have a shite camera.

2882
02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:05.630
Why can't they just copy apple and then take the hit and court?

2883
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:08.780
She's just,
they do it all the time.

2884
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.180
Do it exactly the way do they do it with no variation.

2885
02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:16.790
Change the icon for the phone.
You know,

2886
02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:21.320
make it a big P for fallen a t for text.
Make it real simple like that.

2887
02:48:21.321 --> 02:48:22.310
See for camera,

2888
02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:26.540
make the icons instead of a photo of the fucking thing than it is like a photo

2889
02:48:26.541 --> 02:48:30.020
of a camera lens.
Make it a c.
I know what that means.
I mean it's camera.

2890
02:48:30.350 --> 02:48:34.070
And then I felt applicant's say shit and you can say we're innovators.

2891
02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:37.460
We decided that instead of having an unrecognizable image of a camera,

2892
02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:39.710
we went with a c for camera.

2893
02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:42.223
<v 10>Wow.</v>

2894
02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:47.520
<v 2>Well what Sony's about to release a new lens for the iPhone.</v>

2895
02:48:47.861 --> 02:48:51.430
That's like a professional camera lens.
Like look,
stick on the end of that.

2896
02:48:51.431 --> 02:48:54.930
Look at this thing like,
oh,
that's hilarious.
That's the camera lens.
That's just,

2897
02:48:54.931 --> 02:48:58.690
just carry a phone.
You fuck.
That's bad ass.
That's kind of crazy.

2898
02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:00.973
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

2899
02:49:01.430 --> 02:49:04.340
<v 2>That's so crazy.
Yeah,
and he just snaps on your iPhone.</v>

2900
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:08.010
That is so crazy.
It

2901
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:09.900
<v 0>turns your iPhone into a Dslr</v>

2902
02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:14.510
<v 3>God fucking lenses for it.
Oh,
that's sweet.</v>

2903
02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:18.600
<v 0>It's never going to end.
It's never going to end.</v>

2904
02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:21.960
Every year they're going to keep coming up with crazy or crazier shit.

2905
02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.260
Where's it gonna go DSLRs for your iPhone,

2906
02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:27.690
what is the next thing that's going to be a part of your phone?

2907
02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:31.360
<v 3>I think the next thing is holograms.
No,</v>

2908
02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:34.510
your phone is going to be more used as a remote control with the,
you know,

2909
02:49:34.511 --> 02:49:38.590
the apple TV stuff in the future.
And I think like these four k televisions,

2910
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:41.020
you know,
they're going to,
you know,

2911
02:49:41.290 --> 02:49:44.470
now the phones are doing four k so you're just going to be,
you know,

2912
02:49:44.471 --> 02:49:46.990
just amazing.
Like,
hey,
check out what happened.
And you know,

2913
02:49:46.991 --> 02:49:50.920
today at the store and now you're just singing it to your phone.

2914
02:49:51.010 --> 02:49:53.950
I think more interactions with your TV and phone and computer.

2915
02:49:54.330 --> 02:49:56.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Stuff like that.
No,
I hear Ya.</v>

2916
02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:59.880
I think it's going to be a little ob one helped me will be one.

2917
02:49:59.910 --> 02:50:03.420
You're my only hope.
I think we're gonna make holograms.
I think that's coming.

2918
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:07.760
I think the Hologram.
Oh,
your mom's brains all over.
I think it's,
um,

2919
02:50:08.250 --> 02:50:11.760
just a matter of time before we can develop something that's going to take a

2920
02:50:11.761 --> 02:50:14.520
three d image of something and you're gonna see a miniature version of it.

2921
02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:17.370
So your girl's gonna be able to send you miniature versions of her,

2922
02:50:17.371 --> 02:50:18.600
like fingering herself,

2923
02:50:19.050 --> 02:50:21.750
and you get to play it on the bed and shoot loads onto it.
Oh,

2924
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:25.290
she would never do that.
Yes she would.
Dude,

2925
02:50:25.530 --> 02:50:28.110
she lives in the desert with monkeys and Tarzan.

2926
02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:35.460
Fucking snakes and shit.
All right.
Um,
let's send this,
let's wrap this bitch up.

2927
02:50:35.461 --> 02:50:38.490
Bring it home.
This was a silly and pointless as any podcasts we've ever done.

2928
02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.050
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.

2929
02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:45.600
We've been too serious lately about a lot of shit.
Um,
sometimes yes,
sometimes no.

2930
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:50.490
You know,
people,
a lot of people complained about,
uh,
the,

2931
02:50:50.491 --> 02:50:53.390
uh,
the TV show that I did and the,
uh,

2932
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.740
explanations of conspiracy theories.

2933
02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:58.350
And that's one of the reasons why I didn't want to do those subjects in the

2934
02:50:58.351 --> 02:51:01.440
first place.
It's,
it's too touchy subject with people.

2935
02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:05.210
But I was intoxicated by the,
uh,

2936
02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:10.240
the ideas behind them and the idea behind behind exploring them and finding out

2937
02:51:10.591 --> 02:51:14.040
what people's belief systems are.
Right.
And I learned a lot.
I really did.

2938
02:51:14.041 --> 02:51:18.390
I learned a lot about myself and,
uh,
my own willingness to believe in shit.

2939
02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:20.790
But I also learned about other people's,

2940
02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:24.720
just it's repeatable behavior patterns.

2941
02:51:25.110 --> 02:51:30.110
These repeated behavior patterns where you see how they get locked into all this

2942
02:51:30.271 --> 02:51:33.540
crazy shit.
I'll thinking about all these crazy ideas that,

2943
02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:36.570
that aren't necessarily real looking for mysteries.

2944
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:41.850
And for the most part it's a fucking waste of time.
The Mat,

2945
02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.420
the vast majority of all paranoid and stuff,

2946
02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:48.210
I think is a giant distraction.
The vast majority,

2947
02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:52.500
it doesn't mean there's not some possibilities,
especially for psychic powers.

2948
02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:54.930
The ability to see I've,
I,
you know,

2949
02:51:54.931 --> 02:51:59.931
I've had weird feelings in my life and they turned out to be represented in real

2950
02:52:00.121 --> 02:52:04.200
life.
That it's possible that,
you know,
people have some abilities that are much,

2951
02:52:04.201 --> 02:52:05.980
much stronger than mine.
I've had

2952
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.670
<v 2>some weird moments where I felt like I could sort of figure out that something</v>

2953
02:52:09.671 --> 02:52:12.010
was wrong,
even though there's no natural indication,

2954
02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:14.860
but I don't have any psychic powers at all.
I have zero.

2955
02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:16.990
And because of these weird moments,

2956
02:52:16.991 --> 02:52:19.720
I always leave the door open for a possibility someday.

2957
02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:23.200
But like Miss Mick West said,
it's probably gonna come through technology.

2958
02:52:23.201 --> 02:52:26.260
It's probably the idea that a person becoming psychic,

2959
02:52:26.261 --> 02:52:30.370
it's probably going to get bum rushed by real psychic energy that's created by

2960
02:52:30.371 --> 02:52:32.860
chips before we even will,

2961
02:52:32.861 --> 02:52:36.220
for even going to get close to figuring out how to do it biologically on a

2962
02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:39.460
consistent basis.
I just think that,
um,

2963
02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:45.880
I think these subjects are too,
they're too toxic.
You know,

2964
02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:50.080
there's too much hostility involved and you get involved in these arguments that

2965
02:52:50.081 --> 02:52:51.220
you don't really want to be in.

2966
02:52:51.370 --> 02:52:53.380
I don't want to be in a chem show argument with people,

2967
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:57.580
especially since that person's in his basement doing it and he has all the time

2968
02:52:57.581 --> 02:53:01.520
on the road to fight you with it and you're just like,
all right,
I meant show,

2969
02:53:01.521 --> 02:53:05.290
opened up my Twitter.
Oh Man,
I have to deal with this shit.
It's not only that,

2970
02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:08.290
it's also,
I don't want to be called a shill cause I'm not,

2971
02:53:08.470 --> 02:53:09.880
and just because we disagree with something,

2972
02:53:09.881 --> 02:53:14.590
I don't want you to be mad at me because it's just an idea and it's just,

2973
02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:18.160
it's about let's slap a fuel truck.
I get it,
I get it.

2974
02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:23.260
But it's also about ideas because the alien thing is just about the idea.

2975
02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:24.370
This is just about the idea.

2976
02:53:24.371 --> 02:53:27.760
There's no direct imminent threat by aliens that we need to recognize.

2977
02:53:28.090 --> 02:53:29.350
It's just about the idea.

2978
02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:32.800
And when you start talking about that idea and showing different viewpoints
like,

2979
02:53:32.801 --> 02:53:34.300
hey man,
maybe people were full of shit.

2980
02:53:34.510 --> 02:53:38.080
And then you start meeting a gang of people that are full of Shit and then you

2981
02:53:38.081 --> 02:53:40.660
start reporting,
hey man,
I think these guys are full of shit.

2982
02:53:40.930 --> 02:53:44.860
And that might be what we're seeing here.
People get so fucking mad at you.

2983
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:48.280
And that was something that I kind of anticipated but didn't.

2984
02:53:48.890 --> 02:53:52.420
I thought of it expected that we would be able to maneuver our way around it and

2985
02:53:52.421 --> 02:53:56.260
we weren't able to.
So for all the people that believe in aliens,

2986
02:53:56.380 --> 02:54:00.850
good for you sweetie.
Good for you.
I'm not saying there's no aliens,

2987
02:54:01.270 --> 02:54:05.230
but you best realize that people are full of shit.

2988
02:54:06.520 --> 02:54:08.410
Might not be that there's no aliens,

2989
02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:12.910
but it might be that no one's ever seen an alien that is fucking possible to,

2990
02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:16.690
you've got to take that shit into consideration.
Don't get mad at me pitch,

2991
02:54:17.530 --> 02:54:22.240
I'd love you.
Give me a hug.
Come here,
give me a big,
a big he hug,
he freaks.

2992
02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:26.710
There's plenty of room in this life for love.
You don't have to create conflict.

2993
02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:29.380
And what I really liked about that nick,
Mick West guys,

2994
02:54:29.381 --> 02:54:32.590
he's not trying to start any fights with people.
He's trying to just disagree.

2995
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:37.380
It does so politely.
I think that's,
we could all learn from that guy.
Alright,

2996
02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:40.270
you fucks.
What else could I say?
Love doesn't make sense.

2997
02:54:40.330 --> 02:54:42.730
Tell Jami can't get the fuck off his phone.
If you see him,

2998
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:47.120
tell him pokers for idiots.
Stop it.
It's not really afraid it's,

2999
02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:51.340
but tell him that anyway.
Don't tell him that he's a fucking war hero.

3000
02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:53.380
What does that even mean?
Hey look,

3001
02:54:53.770 --> 02:54:57.340
we love the shit out of you guys and we'll see you Monday.
We got a,
um,

3002
02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.680
quite a few,
uh,
options for guests next week.

3003
02:54:59.681 --> 02:55:04.681
So it should be cool and interesting and fun and always as positive as we can

3004
02:55:05.421 --> 02:55:09.320
make it all right.
No inspirational speeches.
I think I've said enough today.

3005
02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:12.320
So I'll give you a big kiss and we'll see you soon.
