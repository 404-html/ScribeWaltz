<v Speaker 1>Very common in Japan.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cox Right now,</v>

48
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 2>for those who don't know who we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to.</v>

49
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a true mixed martial arts legend or real</v>

50
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:41.241
<v Speaker 2>pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Bas rutten was a former UFC </v>

51
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I first saw boss fight,</v>

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I saw you fight back before there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>any real good striking and mixed martial</v>

53
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mixed martial arts was a lot of.</v>

54
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>karate guys and where'd that good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

56
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:56.001
<v Speaker 2>there was a few people that were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild and crazy that we're getting in </v>

57
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.001
<v Speaker 2>there and trying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

58
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>there was pancreas was going on over in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan and a buddy of mine had sent me a </v>

59
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.140
<v Speaker 2>tape and they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

60
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I forgot who gave me the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>

61
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you got to wash this motherfucker pause </v>
<v Speaker 2>route.</v>

62
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's finally a guy who's over there that</v>

63
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:13.201
<v Speaker 2>knows how to strike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you were bottle last and guys like </v>

64
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>in pancreas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of like they had these,</v>

65
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 2>these Shannon that Shin Pads on for </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks who haven't seen it and you </v>

66
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to punch to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you could use open palms.</v>

67
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 2>So what boss figured out how to do was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull his hand way back so he was </v>

68
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 2>punching with his palm where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else was doing bitch slaps.</v>

69
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Boss was blasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys would straight right palms and </v>

70
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>knocking them unconscious and body kicks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just couldn't believe how much</v>

71
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.721
<v Speaker 2>pain they were in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were one of the first guys from </v>

72
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:42.721
<v Speaker 2>Holland that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

73
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>that hard Dutch style of kickboxing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter into mixed martial arts.</v>

74
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked,</v>

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I used that already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polished rocks when I was a bouncer.</v>

76
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like to mess up my fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always thought you have a way </v>

77
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>longer reach like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a left to grade straight,</v>

78
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that combination,</v>

79
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

80
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>if you connect with the left Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too close for the straight punch </v>

81
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>and had the longer the punches the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

82
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So I said why don't hate with a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.110
<v Speaker 1>because then it becomes almost as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as my straight punch so destroyed will </v>

84
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.110
<v Speaker 1>have more effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

85
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And then people started thinking and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat and if he had bi,</v>

86
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>the ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can see when I'm fighting,</v>

87
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm hitting right here just behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ear at the job and the jaw starts.</v>

88
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you tap it there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll drop where you're one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to you.</v>

90
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:30.401
<v Speaker 1>You analyze different ways to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents and that's why you've got all </v>

91
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>these videos online of self defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques and bars.</v>

92
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the music?</v>

93
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Video one is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

94
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sorry.</v>

95
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looky,</v>

96
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>look what we get here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that get started?</v>

97
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>How did you start doing those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest thing.</v>

98
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I made the big bus writtens big books of</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

99
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I promise that the first 300 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get a self defense,</v>

101
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small one,</v>

102
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the small book like 50 page book or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

103
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>But then this guy screwed me over with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books and when it all happened,</v>

104
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left this guy,</v>

105
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>but I came back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

106
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:13.471
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told the people the first 300 we're </v>

107
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:13.471
<v Speaker 1>going to get it and I want to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

108
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to do anything with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy anymore because you know,</v>

109
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it took too much for me already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

110
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

111
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:23.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm making a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do an instructional DVD and then we </v>

112
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>give that to the first 300 people.</v>

113
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

114
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to get the camera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like totally non scripted,</v>

115
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started at the bar,</v>

116
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:36.241
<v Speaker 1>how funny was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that I go around the bar and I </v>

117
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>see a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

118
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>A saucer or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:43.021
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they should get throw it into </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.900

<v Speaker 1>that holds the receipts,</v>

123
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that pin I grab and I look at the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

124
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to tell your words can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

125
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to stop so many times that we </v>

126
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>were dying laughing and that's all one </v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

127
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>no preparation,</v>

128
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

129
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:04.601
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think like that all the time </v>

130
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and being a bouncer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one one.</v>

131
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a bouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did well.</v>

132
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I actually did work as a bouncer at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concert.</v>

133
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>A place had great woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a concert center and there was a</v>

134
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 2>lot of fights as cons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're constantly dealing with fights,</v>

135
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but that's different than a bar because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bar is more dangerous,</v>

136
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 2>is more contained to concert place is </v>
<v Speaker 2>big and wide open.</v>

137
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>It was an outdoor venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know when you're at a bar,</v>

138
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you must've seen a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Holland.</v>

139
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Holland is a fucking crazy place.</v>

140
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a crazy place and you have to </v>

141
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

142
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in that era that they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>started coming with the weapons.</v>

143
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I was always fortunate to know to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the big guys would come in and they</v>

144
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>would actually give guns to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll put them to the side and when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in with their guns.</v>

146
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

147
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>will be putting restored them for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they went into a homeless </v>

148
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

156
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>something broke out and right away the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big guy,</v>

157
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>the guy was on top of the ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed me from the front and he bear</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're bothering to customers as said.</v>

225
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.060

228
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.380

229
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>they thought I was going to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

234
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:57.861
<v Speaker 1>chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I really can't stand </v>

235
00:09:57.861 --> 00:09:57.861
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

236
00:09:57.861 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't touch me because if you know,</v>

237
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>if you do that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go wrong.</v>

238
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough they were looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

239
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Of course he did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I pushed him and another guy behind </v>

240
00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>him jumped over him and he stabbed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger in.</v>

241
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

242
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stop this right now.</v>

243
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to book my other eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there I went,</v>

244
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.800
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that guy went down the went down </v>

245
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>like one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've never seen anything.</v>

246
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I heard him over to music.</v>

247
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>That was the wildest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they had these little </v>

248
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>microphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

249
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>So with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fast there was like five guys,</v>

251
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 1>four or five guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start finding,</v>

252
00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>going to guided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knocked out constantly because he will</v>

253
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 1>wake up right and everything went good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went good.</v>

254
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I start realizing,</v>

255
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

256
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 1>these guys are going to come back up all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

257
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to come to an end.</v>

258
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They got to get the hell out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just knocking them down.</v>

259
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 1>So you're hitting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're falling down.</v>

260
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Everyone that's coming out to you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking now,</v>

261
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>but you're realizing you've got to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of here.</v>

262
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I had to get out of there and as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

263
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>until this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue what this was.</v>

264
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I am falling against a wall and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hole in the wall,</v>

265
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the little,</v>

266
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bar in front of it.</v>

267
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And there is broomsticks broomsticks but</v>
<v Speaker 1>no brooms on broomsticks just so I'm </v>

268
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>grabbing one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right away when I grabbed one,</v>

269
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

270
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>if I grab one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to grab one,</v>

271
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>so I leave it at code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they passed it and they go,</v>

272
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 1>fighting fire with broomsticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wild.</v>

274
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

275
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go get the hell out of there.</v>

276
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>So I went all the way down and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember to this day it was a door that,</v>

277
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the discover things that you have</v>

278
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>to push in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it opened up.</v>

279
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So I click and it's closed and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

280
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what?</v>

281
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I turned around to it.</v>

282
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

283
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to go only 40 ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit them into throat.</v>

284
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kick him in the balls.</v>

285
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>There's the only thing I'm going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>

286
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at me at all step back </v>
<v Speaker 1>swagger wall.</v>

287
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>They can see the business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.100
<v Speaker 1>But behind me is the whole police force </v>
<v Speaker 1>side because there were windows.</v>

289
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw me in jail and uh,</v>

290
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>because apparently one of those bonuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a cop and yeah.</v>

291
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And I knocked him out of course also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he never told me that he was a god,</v>

292
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have done that.</v>

293
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're there.</v>

294
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.901
<v Speaker 1>And this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a funny story because </v>

295
00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:26.970
<v Speaker 1>before this all happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to my wife and I'm already </v>

296
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:26.970
<v Speaker 1>tanked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

297
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you laughing when you have so </v>

298
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>much fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

299
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm drunk.</v>

300
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

301
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad were too sweet.</v>

302
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Is Blonde Girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

303
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Say I need.</v>

304
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know me if I'm drunk,</v>

305
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anything.</v>

306
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Especially not that I just want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

307
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>So after two days they allow me to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>my first phone call.</v>

308
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And I'm calling my wife and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

309
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh honey,</v>

310
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you got to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax,</v>

311

<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say I got some good and some bad </v>

312
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:52.711
<v Speaker 1>news for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to hear first?</v>

313
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>She says the good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

314
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.020
<v Speaker 1>identify two Swedish girls says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a semi,</v>

315
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Jill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to hate me for this story </v>

316
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 1>because every time it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a hell of a story.</v>

317
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>A story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an outstanding story.</v>

318
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>So how did you get out of the country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

319
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them if they press charges and </v>

320
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

321
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to press charges either.</v>

322
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 1>But apparently they did press charges </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I had to go to court.</v>

323
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So I get this lawyer and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>they drive me from the normal police </v>
<v Speaker 1>station to jail.</v>

325
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like your mood,</v>

326
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:40.090
<v Speaker 1>your you drive into a mountain and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road stops in the middle of a month.</v>

327
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You get out of the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do elevators.</v>

328
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By Goodwin elevate,</v>

329
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd go like four stories up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>take another to go like six.</v>

332
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So I go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

333
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

334
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>was some weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jill with was sitting there with like </v>

335
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>murderers and rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wireless thing ever.</v>

336
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 1>But all the older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older guards knew me.</v>

337
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So I had a VCR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had coffee,</v>

338
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing cards with the guards.</v>

339
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>They actually gave me my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

340
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.580
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

341
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>So then the lawyer comes to the lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

342
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they started it.</v>

352
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's five against one,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he can say anything.</v>

354
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went to court and,</v>

355
00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>some friends in Sweden,</v>

357
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:40.230

<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>seems like that would cut back a lot.</v>

397
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what actually was killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in Brazil.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was a funny story too because I </v>

401
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.780
<v Speaker 1>would go my crazy friend from all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we uh,</v>

402
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get tanked on the plane and,</v>

403
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

404
00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to the restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

405
00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:28.470
<v Speaker 1>well don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

406
00:16:28.471 --> 00:16:32.010
<v Speaker 1>he sits here the aisle next to me and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sits on the other side.</v>

407
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.720
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

408
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but they just turned the light on </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're lending.</v>

409
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do to get to stop the</v>

410
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.040
<v Speaker 1>playing and say go take man.</v>

411
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.070
<v Speaker 1>So he goes up and he's like walking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're going down.</v>

412
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.260
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the rest of my people </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining,</v>

413
00:16:46.261 --> 00:16:47.050
<v Speaker 1>complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

414
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And finally he comes back and he wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get in this before nine slash 11.</v>

415
00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to get in.</v>

416
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

417
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at a frog and I see the </v>

418
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>pilot there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is true story of sweaters and a </v>

419
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>pilot at the doors open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

420
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I want you and let you in if you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front and touch the pilots head.</v>

421
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

422
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>logging down here like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he put his hand on.</v>

423
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his head.</v>

424
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

425
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not not as bad.</v>

426
00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So for some reason they let us into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

427
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the ones can you imagine</v>

428
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 2>happens is now what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna shoot.</v>

429
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.020
<v Speaker 2>You shut your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't shut your cell phone off,</v>

430
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 2>they'll put you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll pull,</v>

431
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 2>turn the plane ride around and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

432
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:34.910
<v Speaker 2>So this was [inaudible] say 96,</v>
<v Speaker 2>97.</v>

433
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Remember when you could get on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>with just.</v>

434
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even have yet to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>driver's license.</v>

435
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 2>So you had to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't know why.</v>

436
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even have to have a driver's </v>
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>

437
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you couldn't get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with nothing.</v>

438
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 2>You just go on with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

439
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>with a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant when I was.</v>

440
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.370
<v Speaker 2>When I used to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing taekwondo tournament,</v>

441
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 2>we would fly all I had today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a ticket,</v>

442
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They told me to Canada for a long time.</v>

443
00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 2>He could go with your driver's license </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write to Canada,</v>

444
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Canada into Mexico.</v>

445
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.540
<v Speaker 2>But then the United States started being</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douche bags about it and you know,</v>

446
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.590
<v Speaker 2>they cut back on Mexicans and Canadians </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming over here and so they made it </v>

447
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 2>more difficult and so Canada and Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it more difficult too.</v>

448
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:17.091
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first used to go to Montreal </v>

449
00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:17.091
<v Speaker 2>comedy festival up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a passport.</v>

450
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 2>You that trouble at the border there all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time in Canada.</v>

451
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Never for some reason they always get me</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

452
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I have no clue why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have your record to find your record.</v>

453
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

454
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 2>if you have a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a salt lake,</v>

455
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 2>like what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happened in Sweden that was not</v>

456
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:33.770
<v Speaker 2>because they went to court and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>threw it out.</v>

457
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter the fact that you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested and you went to court and all </v>

458
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>that and you were going to jail for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

459
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Even if there's no charges that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

460
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 2>that stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have that on your record.</v>

461
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Like Eddie Bravo got arrested once for </v>
<v Speaker 2>legally having a gun.</v>

462
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 2>He got pulled over for a traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>violation.</v>

463
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:53.661
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was working for a check cashing </v>

464
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.400
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to carry around a big bag of cash </v>

465
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 2>with them and he had to carry a gun with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and it was totally illegal,</v>

466
00:18:56.071 --> 00:19:01.071
<v Speaker 2>but he had done something like not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping at a stop sign or something </v>

467
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:01.071
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they pull him over and he said,</v>

468
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let you know I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun,</v>

469
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 2>a loaded gun in the car because I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

470
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.810
<v Speaker 2>They arrested him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They released him because you know,</v>

471
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 2>it was all correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chuck his paperwork.</v>

472
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

473
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Every time he goes to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single time he gets pulled aside </v>

474
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 2>and they check his shit and they asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>him questions and it takes like an extra</v>

475
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.520
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stuck with him the last time I </v>

476
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:22.520
<v Speaker 2>went to and just knowing it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>

477
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had no,</v>

478
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 2>he had no record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did nothing,</v>

479
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never.</v>

480
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:28.521
<v Speaker 2>It never stuck as a record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the fact that he was even </v>

481
00:19:28.521 --> 00:19:28.521
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

484
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.760

485
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.340

512
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:53.630
<v Speaker 2>His body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's not supposed to look like </v>

513
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.630
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to.</v>

514
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 2>That is not a fighter's build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

515
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:59.761
<v Speaker 2>when you see these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys in the UFC a lot of times </v>

516
00:20:59.761 --> 00:20:59.761
<v Speaker 2>in their first couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see when they come in and they're</v>

517
00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:04.621
<v Speaker 2>just too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks good and it might be good for </v>

518
00:21:04.621 --> 00:21:07.651
<v Speaker 2>the first 30 or 40 seconds you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could really guerrilla fuck a guy </v>

519
00:21:07.651 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 2>for 30 or 40 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then that lactic acid builds up</v>

520
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.040
<v Speaker 3>trashing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elvis said it,</v>

521
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

522
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I never cared about it and never get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody said,</v>

523
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:17.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on roids.</v>

524
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it,</v>

525
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:24.530
<v Speaker 3>it is that you're insecure already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's something wrong with </v>

526
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you because you're not happy with </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

527
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that bullshit thing that they say </v>

528
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everybody does it.</v>

529
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been saying I did this.</v>

530
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the amateurs,</v>

531
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

532
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.220
<v Speaker 3>did the camel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the board of the camera and they </v>

533
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.220
<v Speaker 3>asked me to go</v>

534
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.630
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The California,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a amateur mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

537
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

538
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.310
<v Speaker 3>And they asked me to speak to the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

539
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>to help him out in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones to a pro,</v>

540
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 3>what to watch out for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the last and most important </v>

541
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.861
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the most important thing they </v>

542
00:21:58.861 --> 00:21:58.861
<v Speaker 3>said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

543
00:21:58.861 --> 00:21:58.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do robots.</v>

544
00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you already did Royce or are thinking</v>

545
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.910
<v Speaker 3>about doing words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might as well stop your </v>

546
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 3>career because in this particular stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

547
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're already thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fail.</v>

548
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.790
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a loser because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it.</v>

549
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 3>I never got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how dangerous it,</v>

550
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear the EPO,</v>

551
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you know people doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

552
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that make your blood really </v>

553
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 3>think</v>

554
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very dangerous and very common by the </v>

555
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

556
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxers had been caught with it.</v>

557
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane Mosley,</v>

558
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 2>he got caught with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
<v Speaker 2>epo is what they always accused cyclists</v>
<v Speaker 2>of using who was a professional cyclist </v>

560
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>and he was on it and he said that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on a tour,</v>

561
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:38.581
<v Speaker 2>they were on a tour with a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would ride on a bus and then they </v>

562
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 2>would compete in these tournaments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a racist rather,</v>

563
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and you would hear guys in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night on their bikes and go ride.</v>

564
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 2>They had to hear the heart rate goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down or something.</v>

565
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Too much blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much blood builds up in your body.</v>

566
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 2>Because what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what epo simulates is it's like </v>

567
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 2>artificial altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:59.820
<v Speaker 2>like the effect that happens at altitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your blood thickens because you </v>

569
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 2>need more oxygen because it's a low </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen environment.</v>

570
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 2>So these guys and they take this epo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to exercise.</v>

571
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't wake up at like 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and they'll have their </v>

572
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 2>parts all fucked up and they got to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a bike and go.</v>

573
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you can't have a heart attack </v>

574
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

575
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 2>you could have strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

576
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know mixed martial arts guys that have</v>

577
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 2>done it and I know guys that have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that,</v>

578
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their trainer found out like after the </v>

579
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:21.840
<v Speaker 2>fight and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man.</v>

580
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to let us know that you're doing</v>

581
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you get knocked out,</v>

582
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.710
<v Speaker 2>we can tell the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

583
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 2>here's something you should consider.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

606
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it increases your nitric</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxide and all those,</v>

607
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.200
<v Speaker 2>those supplements that people take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Then it'd be uncomfortable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>brought a transition to a broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

622
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.780
<v Speaker 2>he didn't take too many fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't go with your ego and have </v>

623
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.071
<v Speaker 2>fights after you weren't where you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>busy with other things or weren't fully </v>

<v Speaker 2>how'd you manage to do that?</v>

626
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Not full health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not full health.</v>

627
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Knees were bothering me and the one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing to have is tendinitis in</v>

628
00:25:24.011 --> 00:25:26.650
<v Speaker 3>both my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that hits,</v>

629
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.970
<v Speaker 3>if that starts then it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take fish.</v>

630
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Oil Helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you at.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can either both here in the arms </v>

632
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.830
<v Speaker 3>upstairs and if it hits it's about a 45 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes hour a brain which is </v>

633
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.230
<v Speaker 3>unimaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

634
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no clue.</v>

635
00:25:45.551 --> 00:25:49.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like coming from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't describe it.</v>

636
00:25:49.601 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 3>There's no pain like it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing you can do.</v>

637
00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:53.590
<v Speaker 3>You can take pain pills for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

638
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I have to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would lose weight,</v>

639
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.090
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I made a comeback in 2000,</v>

640
00:25:58.091 --> 00:26:01.120
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six weeks before it hated,</v>

641
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had nine weeks to prepare I think two </v>

642
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:06.820
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times,</v>

643
00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:11.821
<v Speaker 3>five days I took off that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally only work my legs because I </v>

644
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:15.370
<v Speaker 3>had the tendonitis and then because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose weight from the pain.</v>

645
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 3>And then I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

646
00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:20.020
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason that I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not fun anymore.</v>

647
00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the grant.</v>

648
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Everything hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

649
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I was rolling with a in Eddie's class </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

650
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.380
<v Speaker 3>with the Goliath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember the big guy there and I was</v>

651
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:34.381
<v Speaker 3>going to finally a Bolo and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chemo Leopoldo Kimra follow and uh,</v>

652
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.820
<v Speaker 3>he very much looks like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like built to make it a role with you </v>

653
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 3>because I need to just get up and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>strike,</v>

654
00:26:40.781 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 3>get a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had tendinitis and I met,</v>

655
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 3>everything was hurting and I could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody looked like,</v>

656

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this bus routes in you?</v>

657
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

658
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:50.020
<v Speaker 3>my police me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

659
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.160
<v Speaker 3>so I got his number of five days later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said two Fridays offset come back </v>

660
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

661
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on now?</v>

662
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a whole different ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

663
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So that means that every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time when you train with that,</v>

664
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.500
<v Speaker 3>it man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

665
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 3>it's so much pain that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll lose weight.</v>

666
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 3>She can't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

667
00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you have tears in your eyes from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paintings.</v>

668
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what exactly is tendinitis?</v>

669
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it from?</v>

670
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I have no clue.</v>

671
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:15.970
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what I,</v>

672
00:27:15.971 --> 00:27:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I realized that began early days when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did track and field.</v>

673
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I already had it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it comes from all the </v>

674
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 3>cortisones that I took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a very sick,</v>

675
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.330
<v Speaker 3>get bad asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad eczema everywhere.</v>

676
00:27:29.331 --> 00:27:34.331
<v Speaker 3>And they gave me a lot cortisones </v>
<v Speaker 3>cohorts were afraid something was going </v>

677
00:27:34.331 --> 00:27:35.360
<v Speaker 3>to happen at the end and the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that has an effect.</v>

678
00:27:35.361 --> 00:27:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I hear when your skeleton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:27:36.951 --> 00:27:38.330
<v Speaker 3>it melts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say.</v>

680
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:39.740
<v Speaker 3>But I guess if it's,</v>

681
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I could have some attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

682
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

683
00:27:43.971 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 4>So you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were a sick kid and you transitioned</v>

684
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.910
<v Speaker 4>somehow into a martial arts champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wild.</v>

685
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you start training really hard </v>

686
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:53.920
<v Speaker 4>because of your sickness because of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>asthma is one of them?</v>

687
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

688
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 4>I got bullied in love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

689
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.140
<v Speaker 4>I was a very lonely kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

690
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I was in the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will,</v>

691
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:07.120
<v Speaker 4>I had a really cool skill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could climb in a tree in the forest </v>

692
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.260
<v Speaker 4>and I could like 45 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forest.</v>

693
00:28:09.261 --> 00:28:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I go call from treetop to treat that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would start to swing it.</v>

694
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

695
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.540
<v Speaker 4>They would follow them if they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>come and so they would go after you and </v>

696
00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:23.900
<v Speaker 4>you would jump from tree to tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a monkey to get away from them.</v>

697
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.570
<v Speaker 4>That's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a few of them fell,</v>

698
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one was almost a,</v>

699
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 4>almost didn't make it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>rock,</v>

701
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 4>but that scared everybody so much that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my harbor,</v>

702
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.050
<v Speaker 4>that was my safe harbor.</v>

703
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:41.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time something happens I just </v>

704
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.611
<v Speaker 4>climbed a tree was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that that's where I got my </v>

705
00:28:42.611 --> 00:28:43.600
<v Speaker 4>athleticism from just climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climbing all the time.</v>

706
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking crazy.</v>

707
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how many mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>artists were bullied.</v>

708
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.160
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

709
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 4>people look at a guy like you and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would go,</v>

710
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:52.280
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking way this guy was ever</v>

711
00:28:52.281 --> 00:28:57.281
<v Speaker 4>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how much of that happens </v>

712
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:57.281
<v Speaker 4>and what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

713
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:58.400
<v Speaker 4>how do you stop that shit from happening</v>
<v Speaker 4>in school?</v>

714
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:03.401
<v Speaker 4>I know you're involved in a lot of anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullying programs and I've seen you do </v>

715
00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:04.490
<v Speaker 4>public service announcements and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

716
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.820
<v Speaker 4>How do you stop that in school?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

717
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

718
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

719
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.580
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make sure that the,</v>

720
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.150
<v Speaker 3>that the whole school knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I will do it.</v>

721
00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 3>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would tell there if I,</v>

722
00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:23.060
<v Speaker 3>if I would speak in front of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

723
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:26.630
<v Speaker 3>that the bullies that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to have sympathy for those guys.</v>

724
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was obviously something's wrong with </v>

725
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.020
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only can team up,</v>

726
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get somebody and they pick the </v>

727
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:36.220
<v Speaker 3>weakest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

728
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.101
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys think does a school that's </v>

729
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:39.101
<v Speaker 3>the biggest</v>

730
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 4>loser of the whole school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that human nature thing,</v>

731
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 4>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like</v>

732
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.100
<v Speaker 1>they probably get beat at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>and if you start talking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully it rings a bell,</v>

734
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but the bullying because otherwise she </v>
<v Speaker 1>can stop this,</v>

735
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

736
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you hear every now and then about guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are fighters who are bullies.</v>

737
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:58.891
<v Speaker 2>you hear about bullying in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who were really good fucking other </v>

739
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:00.840
<v Speaker 2>guys up like young guys and little walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Hector Lombard,</v>

740
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

741
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:06.661
<v Speaker 2>but you hear a lot of stories about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>beating the shit out of young guys and </v>

742
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:06.661
<v Speaker 2>hurting people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 2>and you know that that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something from their childhood.</v>

744
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 2>It just has to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happened there.</v>

745
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary stuff.</v>

746
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 2>You would think that a guy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained fighter though,</v>

747
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's like,</v>

748
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 2>that would be my solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you get bullying out of the </v>

749
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 2>schools?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think you should teach kids how</v>

750
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should have to fight,</v>

751
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 2>offer it in physical education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offer it.</v>

753
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:30.781
<v Speaker 2>Because for a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the most important things </v>

754
00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:30.781
<v Speaker 2>you could ever learn for developing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

755
00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 2>for being just me being more confident </v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting out aggression.</v>

756
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 2>So you can think things more clearly.</v>

757
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

758
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 1>we at Ktl a this morning in a gym and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>

760
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.640

<v Speaker 2>gym in thousand oaks.</v>

761
00:30:44.641 --> 00:30:46.110
<v Speaker 2>And how do people get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

765
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.700

<v Speaker 2>This is a rare opportunity if you live </v>

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 2>in this area to train with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>because of the actually mine and all of </v>

786
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 1>my um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

787
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 1>asthma and Eczema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

788
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And it had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to that how they fix that.</v>

789
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I grew over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the weirdest thing is when</v>

790
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I stepped into the states when I </v>

791
00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 1>was fighting and pancreas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see some fights,</v>

792
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see I still have everywhere have </v>

793
00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:02.571
<v Speaker 1>spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and when I came into America I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a month everything.</v>

795
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean you sort of almost disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gone.</v>

796
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I think also the climate maybe has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with California climate.</v>

797
00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

798
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.430
<v Speaker 1>This is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not too hot,</v>

799
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 1>not too dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

800
00:32:15.231 --> 00:32:15.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

801
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good place.</v>

802
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just said it right.</v>

803
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty awesome here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people in Minnesota freezing their </v>

804
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:25.220
<v Speaker 1>dicks off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

805
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.451
<v Speaker 1>I came into the states and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't everybody in America live </v>

806
00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no houses,</v>

807
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people.</v>

808
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

809
00:32:34.681 --> 00:32:37.880
<v Speaker 1>so you didn't exactly transition out </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any pain that.</v>

810
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So that was one of the reasons you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

811
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

812
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.900
<v Speaker 2>cut your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting</v>

813
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 3>tendonitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

814
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and my knees.</v>

815
00:32:44.051 --> 00:32:49.051
<v Speaker 3>I have no cartilage in my knee caps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds as a very easy thing to </v>

816
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:52.060
<v Speaker 3>fix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in reality is the worst problem.</v>

817
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:53.500
<v Speaker 3>And he can have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

818
00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Chicago Bridge in between the knees when</v>
<v Speaker 3>a boss,</v>

819
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 3>they can do something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.890
<v Speaker 3>but cottage on the kneecap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>

821
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 2>My friend has his knees resurface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deanna resurface with steel.</v>

822
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>They put some sort of a steel or </v>
<v Speaker 2>titanium plate over the knee.</v>

823
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.790
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve was on the US ski team </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the eighties and he fucked his </v>

824
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 2>knees up really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

825
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Like he's had I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 or 17 surgeries on his knees and </v>

826
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 2>they're mangled and they just recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>put artificial meniscus in place.</v>

827
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 2>This like white padded stuff in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the knees and his cartilage is so chewed</v>

828
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 2>up that they actually re resurfaced it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with metal.</v>

829
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 2>So he has like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a crazy looking thing man.</v>

830
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:36.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on top of kneecap.</v>

831
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I have it here somewhere in my email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find it for you before we leave </v>

832
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>tonight so you can check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

833
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.130
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a solution that</v>

834
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 3>my friends do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

835
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:44.490
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

836
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

837
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:47.480
<v Speaker 3>they can put the kneecap is in constant </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>

838
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:52.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like you can put something </v>

839
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:52.570
<v Speaker 3>on there and then because it gets read </v>
<v Speaker 3>off right away again,</v>

840
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.500
<v Speaker 3>what it can do is drill a hole in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>

841
00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I put a teflon played in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then at that if you drilled a hole </v>

842
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 3>and he becomes 35 percent more weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have way more chance to break me.</v>

843
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 3>And once you break your kneecap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

844
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.180
<v Speaker 3>that's why it was my doctor said that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they,</v>

845
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>the is they break your kneecaps because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the worst thing to do to </v>

846
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

847
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knees are brutal,</v>

848
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

849
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I've had three knee operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had um,</v>

850
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.820
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

851
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.220
<v Speaker 2>my left acl reconstructed my meniscus </v>
<v Speaker 2>scope to my left,</v>

852
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.090
<v Speaker 2>my left knee here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a picture of it here.</v>

853
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 2>If you want to check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check this out real quick.</v>

854
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 2>See that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a resurfacing.</v>

855
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>This is where they took his cartilage </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so fucked up.</v>

856
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I took it off and they resurfaced it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with steel and this white stuff in this </v>

857
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.510
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>

858
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial meniscus.</v>

859
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll put this picture on twitter later </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

860
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:47.561
<v Speaker 2>So what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty fucking Korea and the stuff that </v>

861
00:34:47.561 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 2>they can do nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre.</v>

862
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

863
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

864
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is really new stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing,</v>

865
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 2>but I mean his knee looks like it looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

866
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:59.540
<v Speaker 2>And how does he feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels great.</v>

867
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 2>He's the wildest motherfucker I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>

868
00:35:03.141 --> 00:35:08.141
<v Speaker 2>He was a flight surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in his fifties and he's still </v>

869
00:35:08.141 --> 00:35:08.141
<v Speaker 2>trying to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

870
00:35:08.141 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It's out of his mind.</v>

871
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.600
<v Speaker 3>You use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very hard thing to step away </v>

872
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.600
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

873
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.600
<v Speaker 3>to come back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very.</v>

874
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.180
<v Speaker 3>But when I have students of mine or </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends of my fighting,</v>

875
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.740
<v Speaker 3>it's way more nervous than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like because you can't control it.</v>

876
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:21.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like sitting next to the driver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

877
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:22.870
<v Speaker 3>and they go fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go like,</v>

878
00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I rather have the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm in control here,</v>

879
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's um,</v>

880
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.410
<v Speaker 3>now it's hard because there's no feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

881
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:34.470
<v Speaker 3>like when you win or when you for six or</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks you work on like five </v>

882
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.030
<v Speaker 3>special combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:38.650
<v Speaker 3>under ground and standing and then to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if,</v>

884
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 3>if you get land one of those and then 90</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the time you do,</v>

885
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that you really worked on</v>

886
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 3>and then you let that thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a hole in one.</v>

887
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be feeling like that.</v>

888
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think much crazier than that.</v>

889
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's just the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>gamble.</v>

890
00:35:54.711 --> 00:35:59.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out there throwing your bones at </v>

891
00:35:59.711 --> 00:36:02.181
<v Speaker 2>some guy trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to hit his vital areas and it </v>

892
00:36:02.181 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 2>ain't just a regular guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking expert and he's doing the</v>

893
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:09.321
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing and so much of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>success is based on how much dedication </v>

894
00:36:09.321 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time you put in,</v>

895
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 2>how much you can keep your shit together</v>
<v Speaker 2>under pressure was the ultimate high,</v>

896
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>right when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is the ultimate high?</v>

897
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

898
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you say,</v>

899
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.580
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

900
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.620
<v Speaker 3>can you always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you bring the Dojo the way you fight</v>

901
00:36:24.621 --> 00:36:28.070
<v Speaker 3>and train there and spar there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you bring that game</v>

902
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.860
<v Speaker 2>to the ring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I can get the problem.</v>

903
00:36:29.861 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that is a big thing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

904
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a lot of guys fold,</v>

905
00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:37.030
<v Speaker 2>like you'll see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

906
00:36:37.031 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do great and they'll do.</v>

907
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.620
<v Speaker 2>There'll be like dominating and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy will still be there.</v>

908
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you see the adversity,</v>

909
00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:45.700
<v Speaker 2>you see doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see all kinds of creepy things about</v>

910
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck Hans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their subconscious,</v>

911
00:36:48.221 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck is in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

912
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you see it?</v>

913
00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Surface most of the</v>

914
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.650
<v Speaker 3>time is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

915
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you see a guy when you get hit them at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard shot,</v>

916
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's most of them to muscular guys </v>

917
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:01.940
<v Speaker 3>by the way to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

918
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.190
<v Speaker 3>the big blown up dudes when they hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody with their best bang and the </v>

919
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.101
<v Speaker 3>guy recovers and comes back and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see him go down or they haven't met a </v>

920
00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:13.390
<v Speaker 3>submission and they think they had them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the guy has capes,</v>

921
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:18.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a mental break for them and </v>

922
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:18.700
<v Speaker 3>they give up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the weirdest thing.</v>

923
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:18.700
<v Speaker 3>You go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

924
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 3>man is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know so many fighters were real who </v>

925
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 3>are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just do it again.</v>

926
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Do it again and make it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more tight.</v>

927
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

928
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>but not to give up.</v>

929
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:32.270
<v Speaker 2>The fear of losing is a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden that a lot of guys have and </v>

930
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:36.080
<v Speaker 2>eventually manifests itself in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're so afraid of losing </v>

931
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:36.970
<v Speaker 2>their so afraid of fucking up that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

932
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.280
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make it happen.</v>

933
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:43.570
<v Speaker 3>It's afraid of losing in front of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience because they have to listen to </v>

934
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 3>what those people going to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

935
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:46.330
<v Speaker 3>you should've done this and Chris leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

936
00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:47.740
<v Speaker 3>it's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A long time ago,</v>

937
00:37:47.741 --> 00:37:51.100
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got knocked out by a silver and um,</v>

938
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.520
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

939
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.940
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad if you go to the blockbuster </v>

940
00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.180
<v Speaker 3>and the Guy Behind the desk tells you </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you should have done,</v>

941
00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody knows better.</v>

942
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I always say,</v>

943
00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I say you fight for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

944
00:38:04.631 --> 00:38:05.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxer,</v>

945
00:38:05.021 --> 00:38:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you fight for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your wife and your kids.</v>

946
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:11.851
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fight for me because that takes a lot </v>

947
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:11.851
<v Speaker 3>of pressure off because we really think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

948
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>

949
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.150
<v Speaker 3>if you ever fellow fighter and you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>both into a room,</v>

950
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:17.920
<v Speaker 3>you lock the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys fight.</v>

951
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you really care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you lose,</v>

952
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to win,</v>

953
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.380
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

954
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

955
00:38:25.271 --> 00:38:27.370
<v Speaker 3>he's the best man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That day he won that fight.</v>

956
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Now if it's in front of an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to go through all that bs </v>

957
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other people say,</v>

958
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 3>well have no clue what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just see.</v>

959
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all you fighting</v>

960
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 1>for those people and it's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

961
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:40.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why I stay away from the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read this head of I'm going</v>

<v Speaker 1>they will play.</v>

963
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>At the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walked through the cage and you hear</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

966
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:54.151

<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

969
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:58.090

<v Speaker 1>those are not the guys that you see.</v>

982
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a smart game.</v>

983
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Nick Ds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

985
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 1>He loves it and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really nice guy.</v>

986
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I like him lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he gets fired up though when he </v>

987
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fights is now such a nice guy.</v>

988
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way psychological warfare </v>

989
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>is a part of finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

990
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:47.490
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can I always say who's got the </v>

991
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:47.490
<v Speaker 1>biggest balls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can,</v>

992
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going,</v>

993
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:52.380
<v Speaker 1>keep on going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I always say stamina is the </v>

994
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.171
<v Speaker 1>one number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's one thing they can </v>

995
00:39:55.171 --> 00:39:55.171
<v Speaker 1>ever say for me and my mma career.</v>

996
00:39:55.171 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Never run out of gas because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing you can control,</v>

997
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you know when you train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go run an extra hill,</v>

998
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 1>glue something for calmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're losing.</v>

999
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 1>How difficult was that for you though </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you started to get the tendinitis?</v>

1000
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Because you know there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their stamina from,</v>

1001
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 1>from grappling that you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get.</v>

1002
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:17.431
<v Speaker 1>Like I know for a fact that Toc ecosoc a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight when you fought soccer when you </v>

1003

1015
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.980

<v Speaker 1>I had a daughter at the time,</v>

1016

00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 2>what is the effects of light again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People fucking die from it.</v>

1048
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Girls that put it on their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go to get their legs lasered,</v>

1049
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 2>they get the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hair lasered off their legs.</v>

1050
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 2>It's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they cover their legs,</v>

1051
00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:21.560
<v Speaker 2>would lie to Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some girl died in her fucking car,</v>

1052
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:26.710
<v Speaker 2>she covered her legs and Lidacain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then wrapped her legs up and she just </v>

1053
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.060
<v Speaker 2>odd,</v>

1054
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:27.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1055
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're shooting it into your ribs?</v>

1056
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.140
<v Speaker 1>In my rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1057
00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:36.141
<v Speaker 1>I used to many times that I would go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight and then Monday I had my </v>

1058
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>wrestling shoes because we have to wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes at bankwest.</v>

1059
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 1>They will be open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had an ankle injury and I will </v>

1060
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.031
<v Speaker 1>wait until they called my name because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one time I broke my hand the knuckle and</v>

1061
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1062
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 1>we put a light again in there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work for like an hour,</v>

1063
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 15 minutes,</v>

1064
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when your heart rate is up,</v>

1065
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:58.601
<v Speaker 1>it goes really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the moment I stepped into the </v>

1066
00:42:58.601 --> 00:42:58.601
<v Speaker 1>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go like,</v>

1067
00:42:58.601 --> 00:42:58.690
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's back,</v>

1068
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do this again,</v>

1069
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did it on,</v>

1070
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.830
<v Speaker 1>at the moment they would call my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would put,</v>

1071
00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:07.910
<v Speaker 1>put it in and then hopefully I was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to feel it far.</v>

1072
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.880
<v Speaker 2>So you were fighting online to Keynes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shooted in you and then fight,</v>

1074
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1075
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.390
<v Speaker 1>The walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1076
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1077
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:19.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a really bad trip when I was </v>

1078
00:43:19.001 --> 00:43:22.531
<v Speaker 1>running the day before I jumped on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane and it was against Vernon tiger </v>

1079
00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:25.831
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like my fourth fight or </v>

1080
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:25.831
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other and,</v>

1081
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:25.831
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

1082
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:28.960
<v Speaker 1>He takes me down and he goes for a toe </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold in that ankle.</v>

1083
00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1084
00:43:29.471 --> 00:43:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm sending out a signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.600
<v Speaker 1>take this weird signal because whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a tattoo,</v>

1086
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>somebody fucking slaps me tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

1087
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.780
<v Speaker 1>if you have an injury here where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get hit,</v>

1088
00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:42.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hit there.</v>

1089
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

1090
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you hurt your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure someone's going to squeeze it.</v>

1091
00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:51.351
<v Speaker 2>When they shake is a lot of times you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole year without a guide giving you </v>

1092
00:43:52.411 --> 00:43:57.411
<v Speaker 2>one of those douchey handshakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handshakes where he grabs the tip of </v>

1093
00:43:57.411 --> 00:43:58.890
<v Speaker 2>your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1094
00:43:58.891 --> 00:44:01.980
<v Speaker 2>is that about insecure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll go a year for the data,</v>

1095
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.930
<v Speaker 2>but if you hurt your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right away.</v>

1096
00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1097
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.610
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1098
00:44:05.611 --> 00:44:05.940
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

1099
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Fucking strain.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She always picked the line.</v>

1101
00:44:09.281 --> 00:44:11.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the longest way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is way longer.</v>

1102
00:44:11.831 --> 00:44:12.820
<v Speaker 1>You take the shortest</v>

1103
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 2>calculus for a break and I'm fucking </v>

<v Speaker 2>How much again?</v>

1108
00:44:21.651 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:23.300
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got taken out.</v>

1110
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I see people paying with checks,</v>

1111
00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:30.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just fucking whip out </v>

1112
00:44:30.241 --> 00:44:30.241

<v Speaker 2>I cannot.</v>

1113
00:44:30.241 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Then I saw one the other day at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store.</v>

1114
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still using this.</v>

1115
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 2>That's where I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last time I saw too was at the grocery </v>

1116
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.390
<v Speaker 2>store checks people allow you to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>write on a piece of paper.</v>

1117
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Burton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1118
00:44:38.831 --> 00:44:42.970
<v Speaker 1>the big Lebowski.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he pays like 70 nights that milk,</v>

1119
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.980
<v Speaker 1>the opening movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you didn't have all these </v>

1120
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.041
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think you would have kept going </v>

1121
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:54.781
<v Speaker 1>or do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would have kept going a few </v>

1122
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:56.881
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few more years she had because it was </v>

1123
00:44:56.881 --> 00:44:56.920
<v Speaker 1>not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not having stamina and you know,</v>

1124
00:44:56.921 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 1>always been very blessed with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1125
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.760
<v Speaker 1>and people look at me now the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I got how much you're trained.</v>

1126
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't try and for a year,</v>

1127
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I,</v>

1128
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I've just genetically put together </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of my dad.</v>

1129
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.760
<v Speaker 1>My brother has the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a lawyer,</v>

1130
00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:15.430
<v Speaker 1>but he say he's got no fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just good.</v>

1131
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Just good base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jeans.</v>

1132
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all athletes.</v>

1133
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.420
<v Speaker 1>The root site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1134
00:45:19.421 --> 00:45:22.450
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never had a problem with that.</v>

1135
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question was whether or not you </v>

1136
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 1>would keep going.</v>

1137
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1138
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing like it,</v>

1139
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but at the moment the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fun is gone out of training.</v>

1140
00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Training will be so much fun for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know somebody every time </v>

1141
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:41.410
<v Speaker 1>when you roll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time something pops up.</v>

1143
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool man.</v>

1144
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:48.790
<v Speaker 1>There's some new thing and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>started using a lot of people and Works </v>

1145
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and Works and Works and works on my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

1146
00:45:48.881 --> 00:45:53.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every time a new little tears or </v>

1147
00:45:53.881 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody shows you another little thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guillotine choke,</v>

1148
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.640
<v Speaker 1>do it like this because they can escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No surgical pain painting show to me.</v>

1149
00:45:57.641 --> 00:45:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1150
00:45:57.881 --> 00:45:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1151
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like bizarre things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so cool.</v>

1152
00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:08.731
<v Speaker 1>But then the way you have the pain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time it takes the pleasure out of </v>

1153
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it and why she have no more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the use case?</v>

1154
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So you can't roll it all right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1155
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:12.400
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1156
00:46:12.401 --> 00:46:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Especially just after my surgery.</v>

1157
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Regular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This surgery is the same surgery from </v>

1158
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 2>the dowel goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our incident that you just had.</v>

1159
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it added on maybe.</v>

1160
00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1161
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time it got hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1162
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1163
00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 2>What was the actual surgery would they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have done</v>

1164
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.210
<v Speaker 1>between c four or five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five or six?</v>

1165
00:46:28.211 --> 00:46:33.211
<v Speaker 1>My nurse or flat squashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I lost atrophied my whole arm and </v>

1166
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they honed to holes open around </v>

1167
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may,</v>

1168
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>so the nerves are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can breathe again.</v>

1169
00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.730
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of guys get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Say Aldo just got that.</v>

1170
00:46:43.731 --> 00:46:48.590
<v Speaker 2>He has a nerve issue as well as numb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Carlin Carlin had it as well.</v>

1171
00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:50.060
<v Speaker 2>He just had surgery on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin did.</v>

1172
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for Jose Aldo based,</v>

1173
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.800
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite guys as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good man.</v>

1174
00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a bad injury because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna take a long time.</v>

1175
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is over two months ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1176
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed things like I can push a,</v>

1177
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:10.250
<v Speaker 1>brushed my teeth the harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit harder when I watch other </v>

1178
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 1>my armpit or I can shave my whole head </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with a razor blade,</v>

1179
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:14.230
<v Speaker 1>which I couldn't do before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like that.</v>

1180
00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:17.730
<v Speaker 1>But power wise I do 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1181
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1182
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 1>it's really a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weak.</v>

1183
00:47:20.611 --> 00:47:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So when you roll around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1184
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they attack that arm.</v>

1186
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:25.340
<v Speaker 1>There we go again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burgers.</v>

1187
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Well everybody goes into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had um,</v>

1188
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 1>J gig up was Sasha was over and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother and his brother said that nobody</v>

1189
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:35.690
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could break his grip,</v>

1190
00:47:35.691 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 1>had an arm bar.</v>

1191
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I had a really weird way of putting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm bar on,</v>

1192
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but the way I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can escape,</v>

1193
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I control the hand.</v>

1194
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I made sure that the elbow points up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1195
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and I controlled in such a way that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

1196
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you can get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just cover your face,</v>

1197
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the other leg I just can put away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you still can't get out.</v>

1198
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1200
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying,</v>

1201
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 1>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can brag because apparently he's known</v>

1202
00:47:59.321 --> 00:48:01.740
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strong and he says ago,</v>

1203
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I say flipper out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1204
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said this is my wrong arm.</v>

1205
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to go back and got him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arm or right away.</v>

1206
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1207
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't do 15 pounds with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1208
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a very weak arm right now.</v>

1209
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 1>So is it eventually going to come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 100 percent?</v>

1210
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it's like a millimeter a day </v>

1211
00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's two months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that will be six centimeter go </v>

1212
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 1>starting from my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's got to go all the way to here is </v>

1213
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 1>six centimeters of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of Healing?</v>

1214
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Of Healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nerve heals like a millimeter a day.</v>

1215
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:31.360
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1216
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 1>so nine months to a year I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>

1217
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 1>at least he said he says his guns back </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was very late,</v>

1218
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 1>but they misdiagnosed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I walked around with this thing for a</v>

1219
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the thing though?</v>

1220
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:49.591
<v Speaker 1>What was the actual injury?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the compression of the </v>

1221
00:48:49.591 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 1>compression and the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the pain that I had,</v>

1222
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.290
<v Speaker 1>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1223
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 1>the nerve apparently is all bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>little cables.</v>

1224
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 1>He says outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the pain thing,</v>

1225
00:48:57.731 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you squished and you know,</v>

1226
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you're already really far gone.</v>

1227
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And that happened with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no pain anymore.</v>

1228
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1229
00:49:04.271 --> 00:49:08.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst thing because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that's all already died.</v>

1230
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So you're damaging and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>

1231
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1232
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:15.430
<v Speaker 1>So then they go in there and they drill </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out and then you have to wait forever</v>

1233
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 1>for it to heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1234
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing you can do in </v>

1235
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:22.050
<v Speaker 1>between time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to like let him.</v>

1236
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started actually yesterday and I think</v>

1237
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>two days ago I started running on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill but only with the incline so I</v>

1238
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:32.400
<v Speaker 1>can run on the balls of my feet so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have my niche,</v>

1239
00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 1>shocking and I'm actually feeling okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

1240
00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 1>my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I figured,</v>

1241
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:40.531
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can do that then I can at least </v>

1242
00:49:40.531 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 1>start doing my sprints again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I used to be a freak man.</v>

1243
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I could these these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do is I run 10 miles a 10 </v>

1244
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 miles an hour.</v>

1245
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the warmup and then I jump off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started stretching while I put the </v>

1246
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.741
<v Speaker 1>incline all the way up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to nine miles an hour and then I </v>

1247
00:49:55.741 --> 00:49:58.711
<v Speaker 1>jumped on for 45 seconds and offer 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do those 10:10</v>

1248
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:01.280
<v Speaker 1>of those rounds and after that I run </v>
<v Speaker 1>like five minutes,</v>

1249
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:02.980
<v Speaker 1>run it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>

1250
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 1>take a five minute break and then I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>my power training workout.</v>

1251
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 1>This is what when I was the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1252
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.530
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard to say you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your sprints first and then you were </v>

1253
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.510
<v Speaker 1>doing your powertrain that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was fear,</v>

1254
00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:19.511
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do the parks being first at </v>

1255
00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:22.020
<v Speaker 1>hinder shoe which are running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I would do it to mimic the </v>

1256
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>fight because that's what I think is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest problem with a lot of guys.</v>

1257
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1258
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:27.990
<v Speaker 1>you're pumping up</v>

1259
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 3>and you should do apps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of apps before you fight and </v>

1260
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 3>stretch them out because what happens is</v>
<v Speaker 3>your abs,</v>

1261
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:40.841
<v Speaker 3>they start filling up elected so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind your apps or your lungs and they </v>

1262
00:50:40.841 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you see the roid guys because</v>

1263
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 3>they have the right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go strong,</v>

1264
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they drop and I think it really</v>

1265
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.750
<v Speaker 3>is because of the abs day because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1266
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 3>If they do 10 times this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it stays like this,</v>

1267
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:55.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bobs up while imagine that happens to</v>

1268
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>your core and with everything while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting,</v>

1269
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you're using your core takedown defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1270
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 3>So that's not bloating up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stops your lung from breathing,</v>

1271
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.780
<v Speaker 3>that's why you're here.</v>

1272
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.580
<v Speaker 2>So you think are important for stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1273
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Very important to keep them loose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep them losing,</v>

1274
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.580
<v Speaker 3>to stretch them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very important.</v>

1275
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I would take before a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also an aspirin,</v>

1276
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make my blood thin because I in Thai </v>

1277
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.190
<v Speaker 3>boxing I would never wear reps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to have reps around me.</v>

1278
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.120
<v Speaker 3>So he'll go bare knuckle into gloves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to shoes.</v>

1279
00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I hated those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1280
00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:28.900
<v Speaker 3>this was totally Japanese rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1281
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.120
<v Speaker 3>The shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens is those Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1283
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:34.090
<v Speaker 3>they're really good on the ground and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say okay,</v>

1284
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:37.090
<v Speaker 3>and the striking not so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's put a machine guards,</v>

1285
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:42.100
<v Speaker 3>let's put them on knee protection and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushers because the good would lag lux </v>

1286
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.290
<v Speaker 3>and no gloves because under good for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rear naked choke and all.</v>

1287
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're totally adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I left bankers,</v>

1288
00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.140
<v Speaker 3>I think two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three months later it was,</v>

1289
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.640
<v Speaker 3>they changed the rules so it was close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1290
00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:55.641
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been waiting for a long time for </v>

1291
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:55.641
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1292
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:55.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to try to adapt to.</v>

1293
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 2>It could be mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>

1294
00:51:57.771 --> 00:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So is it pancreas where you hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees?</v>

1295
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1296
00:52:02.071 --> 00:52:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1297
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm so.</v>

1298
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm very explosive and I think over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years that just scraped over my things a</v>

1299
00:52:09.391 --> 00:52:14.391
<v Speaker 3>bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that bleeding bone marrow out </v>

1300
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:14.391
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1301
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:14.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like very painful.</v>

1302
00:52:14.521 --> 00:52:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Manage a.</v>

1303
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:20.500
<v Speaker 2>it's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do any other martial arts </v>

1304
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.051
<v Speaker 2>exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have that thing that you </v>

1305
00:52:23.051 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 2>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of it because you don't</v>

1306
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.410
<v Speaker 2>want to hit things</v>

1307
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:25.650
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly like that.</v>

1308
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it has no impact.</v>

1309
00:52:26.971 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to get good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1310
00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.770
<v Speaker 3>the tendinitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every fighter should use that thing like</v>

1311
00:52:31.771 --> 00:52:34.830
<v Speaker 3>12 days before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that heavy bag anymore.</v>

1312
00:52:34.831 --> 00:52:36.210
<v Speaker 3>That's where the accidents happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1313
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:38.460
<v Speaker 3>you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweat under bag,</v>

1314
00:52:38.461 --> 00:52:40.350
<v Speaker 3>but you gloves to slips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>order it,</v>

1315
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:45.460
<v Speaker 3>wrist hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always things happened with a </v>

1316
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:45.720
<v Speaker 3>heavy bag and they like to hit a heavy </v>
<v Speaker 3>bag,</v>

1317
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.060
<v Speaker 3>which I did also because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cool thing,</v>

1318
00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:50.760
<v Speaker 3>but there's always that moment when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit really hard,</v>

1319
00:52:50.761 --> 00:52:53.760
<v Speaker 3>like liver shop and you feel then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1320
00:52:53.761 --> 00:52:55.440
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow I got the tendonitis,</v>

1321
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.250
<v Speaker 2>develop this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1322
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It's called the boss system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

1323
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 2>what does it stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

1324
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 3>body action stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was there's a long time</v>

1325
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:06.180
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago,</v>

1326
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:11.190
<v Speaker 3>like four years or something ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my agent tells me that the woman wants </v>

1327
00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:18.111
<v Speaker 3>to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a product and it started out </v>

1328
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:18.690
<v Speaker 3>with a stent with two of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kicking things.</v>

1329
00:53:18.691 --> 00:53:23.691
<v Speaker 3>She knows that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I came to her and I was hanging up,</v>

1330
00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 3>hung over to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last period that I was still </v>

1331
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 3>drinking and I walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1332
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:34.351
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you right now because you </v>

1333
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:34.351
<v Speaker 3>can breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can smell it.</v>

1334
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me take a look at this thing and I </v>

1335
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.150
<v Speaker 3>call you back tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1336
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I looked at the thing and the next </v>

1337
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:42.350
<v Speaker 3>day I called Becca said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1338
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:43.260
<v Speaker 3>now this is why we should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had this whole list ready.</v>

1339
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 3>She goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1340
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1341
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 3>We thought you didn't notice anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said No.</v>

1342
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 3>And then I came up to do a body pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1343
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I make targets on there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

1344
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.020
<v Speaker 3>then it starts because people think this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an easy product.</v>

1345
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 3>There's knockoffs from distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1346
00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.510
<v Speaker 3>They're already selling knockoffs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you bite a thing,</v>

1347
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>then you reel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like our early stages.</v>

1348
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:04.540
<v Speaker 3>What you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to flop around,</v>

1349
00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:09.541
<v Speaker 3>they're going to break because you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find a spring that is just right to </v>

1350
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:14.340
<v Speaker 3>not be too floppy and not too stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too stiff.</v>

1351
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 3>The whole will move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's too floppy,</v>

1352
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you can't knock it for the second punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's still moving.</v>

1353
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be just right now,</v>

1354
00:54:22.051 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 3>the foam in there needs to be just right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now foam,</v>

1355
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 3>the density,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the density.</v>

1356
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 3>If it's really tight form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's heavier,</v>

1357
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1358
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 3>So if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1359
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.450
<v Speaker 3>is this a little bit too hard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want different foam,</v>

1360
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you put different form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now because it's lighter than the </v>

1361
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.340
<v Speaker 3>spring needs to be changed again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every time I got like eight </v>

1362
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.951
<v Speaker 3>prototypes and I have to train on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things the whole time to see and find </v>

1363
00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 3>out which is watching what's the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>way and the best form with what spring?</v>

1364
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.440
<v Speaker 3>It took two and a half years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two and a half years to find that they </v>

1365
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 3>hit that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean 30,000</v>

1366
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 3>times with a machine Dong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dong,</v>

1367
00:54:58.051 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Dong that thing when you buy a windbreak</v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys,</v>

1368
00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:06.650
<v Speaker 3>there was two heads broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was from a shipment that we </v>

1369
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:09.681
<v Speaker 3>right away to out because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something with the glue that that it </v>

1370
00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:09.681
<v Speaker 3>didn't connect with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1371
00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 3>it was vaporizing or eating the glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it didn't work.</v>

1372
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 3>There was to only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sent a new handbag and we never.</v>

1373
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:16.760
<v Speaker 3>And we sold a lot of those things have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

1374
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.660
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you use those yourself?</v>

1375
00:55:18.661 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you use every time when I train?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1376
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 3>what I now right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1377
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I use a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do hooks like see,</v>

1378
00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.970
<v Speaker 3>that's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird angle for me and apricots.</v>

1379
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 3>If I make 10 uppercuts guts the last to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go slow up because it's.</v>

1380
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's biceps.</v>

1381
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Now you really realize that you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>your biceps in order to put your body </v>

1382
00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 3>weight into a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't look it up now.</v>

1383
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 3>A straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with,</v>

1384
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 3>but hooks I can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the globe again hit you as hard as I</v>

1385
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 3>wanted your belly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to go down real.</v>

1386
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1387
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.550
<v Speaker 3>it's pathetic when I look at it like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>need you wild,</v>

1388
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 3>like having no raps on.</v>

1389
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I always have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have my blood flow.</v>

1390
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some reason.</v>

1391
00:55:57.571 --> 00:56:02.571
<v Speaker 3>I have the feeling that this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't circulate any more </v>

1392
00:56:02.571 --> 00:56:03.500
<v Speaker 3>naturally so baffling when you got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tight wrap on it.</v>

1393
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

1394
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:06.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he had the right way.</v>

1395
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 3>All these guys are so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Tyson.</v>

1396
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:14.361
<v Speaker 3>I always give the example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just know or just learn how to hit the </v>

1397
00:56:14.361 --> 00:56:14.550
<v Speaker 3>correct way and nothing will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>

1398
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:19.820
<v Speaker 3>they come into a room and they get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>special guys that they got to stitch </v>

1399
00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>their on call every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two times a day or at the hands.</v>

1400
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 3>He can hit it in any</v>

1401
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.180
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter.</v>

1402
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So then when you were this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why when you had a street fight,</v>

1403
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 1>he would always break his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1404
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Dyson because you don't know how to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hits him with a pinky.</v>

1405
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1406
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Wrong technique.</v>

1407
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Just when you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because guys move and sometimes you want</v>

1408
00:56:40.071 --> 00:56:45.071
<v Speaker 2>it to hit them with these two knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cosby accidentally catch them with the </v>

1409
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:45.071
<v Speaker 2>last knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1410
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:45.071
<v Speaker 2>of course</v>

1411
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.080
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.640
<v Speaker 1>And especially in karate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cube machine karate years </v>

1413
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.560
<v Speaker 1>sparring in his bare knuckle and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys to have a gooey and some guys</v>

1414
00:56:55.561 --> 00:56:56.610
<v Speaker 1>have their hips here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1415
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's how I broke this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1416
00:56:58.591 --> 00:57:03.591
<v Speaker 1>you hit a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think you have to get the </v>

1417
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:03.591
<v Speaker 1>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1418
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:03.591
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hip bone.</v>

1419
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hurt.</v>

1420
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.490
<v Speaker 1>That was a good thing in mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts because now you can see what you're</v>

1421
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:08.820
<v Speaker 1>hinting at.</v>

1422
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Now you started out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started out in taekwondo.</v>

1423
00:57:11.421 --> 00:57:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A taekwondo.</v>

1424
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.660
<v Speaker 2>My forest sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1425
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I did that for about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1426
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 1>four weeks or six weeks and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already beaten up the brown belts.</v>

1427
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents are very conservative.</v>

1428
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will never allow me to do a martial</v>

1429
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always got bullets and I saw Bruce</v>

1430
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:34.560

<v Speaker 1>in um,</v>

1431
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 1>in France when we were on a holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I came out and say,</v>

1432
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be Bruce Lee,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so make these noon chucks.</v>

1434
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on my shoes.</v>

1435
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I had all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really.</v>

1436
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1437
00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I asked my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

1438
00:57:48.071 --> 00:57:48.550
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

1439
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:49.570
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they wouldn't allow me.</v>

1440
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So I kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept going,</v>

1441
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 1>trading myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching movies and just kept trying.</v>

1442
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:55.690
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after two years they said,</v>

1443
00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1445
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And we had a neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl next door,</v>

1446
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 1>she had a boyfriend who was the cool guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the town and he said,</v>

1447
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come with me kind of under a swing.</v>

1448
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1449
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I went really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started being up,</v>

1450
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brown belts I'll like within six </v>

1451
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1452
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a good feeling.</v>

1453
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Show my confidence rose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that moment I was driving,</v>

1454
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.680
<v Speaker 1>riding my bike on the streets and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest bully comes with six of his </v>

1455
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.581
<v Speaker 1>buddies or something and they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I shot at something back </v>

1456
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 1>and it all laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're laughing at a right away.</v>

1457
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Came after me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I saw them coming from me,</v>

1458
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I stopped my bike and I put it down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just waiting for the guy.</v>

1459
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And then the biggest bully comes to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's put,</v>

1460
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you know that at the early days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you push with your chest and he </v>

1461
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 1>pushed against my chest and I go puff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes down,</v>

1462
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 1>broke his nose out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody more?</v>

1463
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come home,</v>

1464
00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:56.700
<v Speaker 1>police was already home and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more taekwondo for me.</v>

1465
00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>So when I moved out of the house when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 21,</v>

1466
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I started fighting.</v>

1467
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:03.350
<v Speaker 2>That's when you started kickboxing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1468
00:59:03.351 --> 00:59:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Keep boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Boy Tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did you transition into </v>

1470
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:09.210
<v Speaker 2>pancreas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did that come about?</v>

1471
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:09.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1472
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.360
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got time,</v>

1473
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1474
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

1475
00:59:12.771 --> 00:59:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Now let me go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

1476
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I was fighting a Thai boxing in Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a lot of fights by knockout,</v>

1477
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 1>like my first fights have been by </v>
<v Speaker 1>knockout character 13.</v>

1478
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And the first one when I was sick was </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1479
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your final kickboxing record when you </v>

<v Speaker 1>16 and to now 14 minutes to losses.</v>

1481
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So I fought this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1482
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.100
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1483
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.730

<v Speaker 1>looked at Frank Lockman,</v>

1484

<v Speaker 1>very powerful fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a record like 52 with like three </v>

<v Speaker 1>Not got some monster now.</v>

1486
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:57.551
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I was a bouncer at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently on New Year's day when I was </v>

1487
00:59:57.551 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 1>bouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also drunk.</v>

1488
00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an example of.</v>

1489
01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And somebody asked me if I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight him and I said sure.</v>

1490
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So in I think by the end of January I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a phone call.</v>

1491
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>They asked me where to send the posters </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1492
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what poses from the fight?</v>

1493
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I said he's was gonna fight you against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lockman.</v>

1494
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who said that?</v>

1495
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>He said you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told me that you got to firefox.</v>

1496
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So now they had posters already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go like,</v>

1497
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1498
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I might as well I got to do it now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they're going to think</v>

1499
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1500
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So I had about five weeks to train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you got understand that I,</v>

1501
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.540

<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1503

<v Speaker 1>There was a wall.</v>

1507
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I jumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1508
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I was always really good in jumping up </v>

<v Speaker 1>I would stand in front of it and jump on</v>

1511
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:05.261
<v Speaker 1>a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had been raining and I jumped on </v>

<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1513
01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I slipped up and I landed on my Shin on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1514
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So the rip my Shin Open so they have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight was all wild flesh and we had to </v>

1515

<v Speaker 1>tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just put it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll numb up the whole egg in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

1523
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said he put it in my butt.</v>

1524
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So he says the leg will be numb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that fight.</v>

1525
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.100

<v Speaker 1>my leg.</v>

1529
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like the weirdest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1530
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1536
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>My leg doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.800

1542
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>So that really bugged me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1543
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1544
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight another fight.</v>

1545
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't have done it either because on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three days or four days before the </v>

1546
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:13.400
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped a buddy of mine,</v>

1547

<v Speaker 1>and his mouth was closed.</v>

1549
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:25.281
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to the guys who did it and we </v>

1550
01:02:25.281 --> 01:02:27.501
<v Speaker 1>got in a little scuffle there of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they threw me in jail for a couple </v>

1551
01:02:27.501 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>of days in the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is why kick in Canada,</v>

1552
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End of July,</v>

1553
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I got an infection in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my testicles.</v>

1554
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it became like really big and it was</v>

1555
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>hurting a lot and they let me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1556
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>because it was only a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once they did the whole test and they</v>

1557
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>found out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>what the guys did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1559
01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1560

<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna bring it to Guardino </v>
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>

1561
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>They kind of felt w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1562
01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing bobby did.</v>

1563
01:02:56.130 --> 01:03:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still fought and I shouldn't have </v>

1564
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.231
<v Speaker 1>taken a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knocked the guy down three times in </v>

1565
01:03:03.231 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the first round and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1566
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and actually I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1567
01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 1>when I make a spinning back fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1568
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:14.391
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's standing in front of me and I'm so </v>

1569
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>tired to know my body is tired and I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1570
01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I make good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1571
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.050
<v Speaker 1>best in his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes down.</v>

1572
01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently like a month before there</v>

1573
01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>was a rule that if you did a bad fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only could do it with a turn.</v>

1574
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Some bullshit live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:03:30.151 --> 01:03:31.920

<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1576
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't come out for the second round</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was too tired.</v>

1577
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

01:05:21.381 --> 01:05:21.381
<v Speaker 1>so then he came back and he had like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1621
01:05:21.381 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>these wooden things that were this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

1622
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would spread them out like a day </v>

1623
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I would like pick on read and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold it and I would stand in front of it</v>

1624
01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:35.040
<v Speaker 1>that I go by because of fear of what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>will break it,</v>

1625
01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:36.560
<v Speaker 1>all of it and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll do it.</v>

1626
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And that caught on real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really started to seem to like </v>

1627
01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly we were doing this on bigger</v>

1628
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>shows first in nightclubs.</v>

1629
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Debbie started doing it on shows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1630
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big events.</v>

1631
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Rob came and when he was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when he had the main event </v>

1632
01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>one time we were in the break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:58.291
<v Speaker 1>showing this to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that got aired and then we were on </v>

1634
01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Dutch Dev and then your eurosport saw it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had an event yearly in,</v>

1635
01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:05.631
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went to there and we started </v>

1636
01:06:05.631 --> 01:06:05.631
<v Speaker 1>traveling now and doing these shows all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

1637
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And comedy was always the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we start doing the comedy,</v>

1638
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 1>people will know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1640
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:18.150
<v Speaker 1>so on one of these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we came up with all these foot </v>

1641
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.530
<v Speaker 1>flux and some salt and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Dolman was sitting there and Chris</v>

1642
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Dolman is one of the forefathers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland was a judo champion.</v>

1643
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1644
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called me to him and he says,</v>

1645
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1647
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think about free fighting?</v>

1648
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1649
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1650
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that in Japan.</v>

1651
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Are you interested?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1652
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I go,</v>

1654
01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

1655
01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 1>come and try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I walk in there and that,</v>

1656
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that moment of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1657
01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:50.161
<v Speaker 1>European champion Thai boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a because the dose to fight </v>

1658
01:06:50.161 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>for a title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I was too cool dude.</v>

1659
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was literally like Royce Gracie</v>

1660
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1661
01:06:55.871 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I walk in and they killed me and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will put on these jokes,</v>

1662
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 1>not blood sugars but like on my windpipe</v>
<v Speaker 1>ido and pulling,</v>

1663
01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:08.581
<v Speaker 1>pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling because a lot of those kind of </v>

1664
01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:08.581
<v Speaker 1>grappling back zero.</v>

1665
01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandpa when you went there?</v>

1666
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:10.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1667
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1668
01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw them on the ground and,</v>

1669
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1670
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I drove back,</v>

1674
01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:27.931
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop my car next to the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had one of the first Phillips for </v>

1675
01:07:27.931 --> 01:07:32.430
<v Speaker 1>cell phone.</v>

1682
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:45.340
<v Speaker 1>food for like three days because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat was messed up because I thought I</v>

1683
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>could hold that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1684
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>so I was just fighting it and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling,</v>

1685
01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:50.400
<v Speaker 1>pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delete.</v>

1686
01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I would that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was all crushed up and,</v>

1687
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>and my wife was already left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1688
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1689
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.290
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it,</v>

1690
01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:57.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1691
01:07:57.311 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back and within six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1693
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>36 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tap everybody there,</v>

1694
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to learn this.</v>

1695
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But things started happening and,</v>

1696
01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:11.781
<v Speaker 1>and I got an injury here and injury </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I had to work and it was a </v>

1697
01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:11.781
<v Speaker 1>bouncer and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it kind of away.</v>

1699
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Then my wife looks at me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of her career and she says,</v>

1700
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a famous fighter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

1701
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that she says that </v>

1702
01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:27.830

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fight anymore.</v>

1704
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I told you.</v>

1705
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you're going to go to Japan.</v>

1707
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Six months after she made that comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a phone call and I never pick up </v>

1708
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:42.131
<v Speaker 1>the phone and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an answering machine was broke or turn </v>

1709
01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>off because my crazy ex wife was calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time so I didn't turn on.</v>

1710
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>So I get the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1711
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the phone for some reason and </v>

1712
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:51.980

<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a tryout is two guys who give </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nike to looking for fighter,</v>

1716
01:08:56.491 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 1>for a new organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bankers.</v>

1717
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the tryout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a scuffle with one of the rings </v>

1718
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 1>champion because they were fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings,</v>

1719
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.360
<v Speaker 1>but it was a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard already that they were having </v>

1720
01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:10.360
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which works,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fixed fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of them pancreas right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and there wasn't rings in bankers.</v>

1723
01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I will go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1724
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe so that there was,</v>

1725
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but not what the people said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never asked me.</v>

1726
01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back to that also anyway,</v>

1727
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>because he told me right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1728
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:30.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to ask you a little </v>

1729
01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:30.701
<v Speaker 1>bit later if you want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1730
01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I started sparring with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a rings champion.</v>

1731
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He tried to hurt me because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming.</v>

1732
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Result was me knocking him out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high cake boom.</v>

1733
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And as he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole eyebrow was open.</v>

1734
01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>You had to go to the hospital for </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>

1735
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Suzuki a finicky I sort of pointing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1736
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think two months,</v>

1737
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:48.590
<v Speaker 1>two and half months later I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

1738
01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1739
01:09:48.921 --> 01:09:53.921
<v Speaker 1>and before I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that speech from crystal and he </v>

1740
01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:53.921
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably going to ask you,</v>

1741
01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:53.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1742
01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:55.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose or to win a fight a sick because</v>

1743
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

1744
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wanna,</v>

1745
01:09:58.450 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>if I fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be real automized I don't,</v>

1746
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I hated those guys who were there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1747
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would come back and they would say,</v>

1748
01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1749
01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.920
<v Speaker 1>became which MPN?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were all cool.</v>

1750
01:10:09.921 --> 01:10:11.600
<v Speaker 1>But then when it came back and they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose,</v>

1751
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.400
<v Speaker 1>they will come back and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1752
01:10:13.401 --> 01:10:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1753
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.400
<v Speaker 1>they had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to lose.</v>

1754
01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time they made you when you know,</v>

1755
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but you don't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only saved when you lose.</v>

1756
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I hated those guys with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1757
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you're not a real guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knocked a guy out and in the second</v>

1758
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>fight I know the other guy out for four </v>
<v Speaker 1>k.</v>

1759
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 1>and then by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had dinner with [inaudible] who can </v>

1760
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 1>either go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1761
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 1>here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1762
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>so dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave me a book from Fujiwara,</v>

1763
01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.420
<v Speaker 1>a really good wrestler and a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>

1764
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And they put me on a cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just before they walked in,</v>

1765
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I go over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1766
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought you guys were going to ask me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

1767
01:10:49.551 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1768
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal told me that you know,</v>

1769
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>that you probably going to ask to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1770
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>to throw the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Suzuki told me straight in my face,</v>

1771
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I will never ask just a such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1772
01:11:00.331 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 1>we will never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1773
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Over the years I've been hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1774
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and some fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at fights,</v>

1775
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it looks really smooth and going over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like Ken Shamrock,</v>

1776
01:11:09.441 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost also.</v>

1777
01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.880
<v Speaker 1>He lost the last fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Role works,</v>

1778
01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also you go like,</v>

1779
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:20.511
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost twice by exactly the same </v>

1780
01:11:20.511 --> 01:11:23.361
<v Speaker 1>combination and he'll look into a knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar against the same opponent that you </v>

1781
01:11:23.361 --> 01:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was a not real,</v>

1782
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:26.720
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

1783
01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really do two times the same.</v>

1784
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's been also in my head,</v>

1785
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess you ever see Bart Vale versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken Shamrock?</v>

1786
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks so fake.</v>

1787
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the early ones that looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like a work.</v>

1788
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:41.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a few that look like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's one of them.</v>

1789
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the ones in pride,</v>

1790
01:11:43.111 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 1>like remember when Coleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all were commentating on that one.</v>

1791
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1792
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I hated my guts because that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest thing ever.</v>

1793
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 1>We knew that Coleman was going to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the six minutes with a heel hook.</v>

1794
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New debts was the word I heard that.</v>

1795
01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:01.800
<v Speaker 1>So when the reporters came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked me what do you think is going</v>

1796
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 1>to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

1797
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I say Takata is gonna win in about six </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes with the event around.</v>

1798
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And they changed it but like faster or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1799
01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.470
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really didn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was doing that.</v>

1800
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:18.060
<v Speaker 1>But I go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something again,</v>

1801
01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I get.</v>

1802
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I get emotional from it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

1803
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a fake.</v>

1804
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the worst one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say is yeah.</v>

1805
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes there was faking boss </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know of it.</v>

1806
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.500
<v Speaker 1>So they told the opponent to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>against bus you was like against um,</v>

1807
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I fought against for Nike and then one </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy said one time he said,</v>

1808
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:35.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1809
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 1>that was a work because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1810
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.090
<v Speaker 1>didn't uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt you.</v>

1811
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did he decide that he was going to </v>

1812
01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>lose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it before or after he tried to break</v>

1813
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 1>my fricking leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1814
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see the fight,</v>

1815
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 1>he pushed me a heel hook and inverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll look with the toes in his neck and</v>

1816
01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:57.261
<v Speaker 1>my heel is 180 degrees there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally looking at my own leg and </v>

1817
01:12:57.261 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1818
01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel it.</v>

1819
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought nobody else.</v>

1820
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 1>That was a big risk what he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

1821
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 1>If this was a fake fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1822
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I needed to like two or three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll see my leg completely be </v>

1823
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>turned the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you suffer any damage?</v>

1824
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1825
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue how diverse he'll hook </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1826
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst is the worst one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke this,</v>

1827
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1828
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1829
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>We should certainly be here with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

1830
01:13:19.331 --> 01:13:24.331
<v Speaker 1>We're hybrids wrestling playing Chris we</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at is this giant screen and the </v>

1831
01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:27.960
<v Speaker 1>first thing you see is me barf giving a </v>
<v Speaker 1>palm strike and the guy goes down and we</v>

1832
01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1833
01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You enter the Promo for the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see this Guy Tucker high,</v>

1834
01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:35.230
<v Speaker 1>she sitting in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1835
01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>in a half guard and he grabs a heel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls back and I go,</v>

1836
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

1837
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>A time I had nobody to roll with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1838
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I traded on a bag two times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first year and a half.</v>

1839
01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And bankers wasn't be trading on a bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much once the wrestling.</v>

1840
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1841
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like Bijou rolling a rock.</v>

1842
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>If there was somebody who knew judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go.</v>

1843
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about once every three </v>

1844
01:13:59.150 --> 01:13:59.150
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

1845
01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 1>So next day I'm in deposition and I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1846
01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I might as well try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1847
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed that heel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since I never did it,</v>

1848
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how much pressure I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1849
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed it and I fall back using my</v>
<v Speaker 1>body weight.</v>

1850
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I snapped the Shinan APP.</v>

1851
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>So first we hear we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:19.381
<v Speaker 3>so I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you see me letting go and then he </v>

1853
01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:19.880
<v Speaker 3>feels his knee and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1854
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 3>if you want to fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1855
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.030
<v Speaker 3>But I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh dude,</v>

1856
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice snap.</v>

1857
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:29.611
<v Speaker 3>Because we thought it was a knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it was still like a </v>

1858
01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:31.600
<v Speaker 3>little stuck on that leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he kicks with Utla and I flex my</v>

1859
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:32.940
<v Speaker 3>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the man,</v>

1860
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>he puts the foot down a vents all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way out.</v>

1861
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that a few times as well.</v>

1862
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a few times with checked legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only in person wants Corey Hill and I'm </v>

1863
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:44.120
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>

1864
01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 2>We fought A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brent's no tells his name.</v>

1865
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever he fought,</v>

1866
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:53.521
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he checks his kick and Corey hills legs </v>

1867
01:14:53.521 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 2>snaps backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Referee didn't even see it.</v>

1868
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.760
<v Speaker 2>So corey goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the referee was in a bang.</v>

1869
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 2>We're all screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop the fight.</v>

1870
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Referee didn't even know and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>on his back,</v>

1871
01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 2>like freaking out.</v>

1872
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially the Shin when it's </v>

1873
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>splintered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1874
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>and it hits a wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1875
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.220
<v Speaker 3>you can pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can bleed out that guy or that you,</v>

1876
01:15:10.221 --> 01:15:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you showed me,</v>

1877
01:15:11.421 --> 01:15:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I think on twitter you can tweet with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was fighting with the broken</v>

1878
01:15:14.871 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 3>arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever.</v>

1879
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.480

<v Speaker 3>how tough is that dude?</v>

1880
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:22.630
<v Speaker 3>And he did a feel then the referee solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>in around three and then they stopped </v>

1881
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:25.811
<v Speaker 3>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy was just going annihilate </v>

<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

1918
01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.770

1919
01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:54.910

01:18:43.831 --> 01:18:43.831
<v Speaker 1>need to do it the third time.</v>

1965
01:18:43.831 --> 01:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he declined to fight in pride with </v>

1966
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1967
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>that's what he came personally to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1968
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss,</v>

1969
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I told him that I didn't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were already for two times.</v>

1970
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:53.540
<v Speaker 1>What does I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gap and you find pancreas.</v>

1971
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:58.541
<v Speaker 1>He never fought a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but but also at that time I was a </v>

1972
01:18:58.541 --> 01:18:58.780
<v Speaker 1>totally different fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it can't,</v>

1973
01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:02.330
<v Speaker 1>can't fight against me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me who I am.</v>

1974
01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That that fight was like literally God </v>
<v Speaker 1>was watching and he says,</v>

1975
01:19:06.621 --> 01:19:11.621
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you this one guy to train with </v>

1976
01:19:11.621 --> 01:19:12.650
<v Speaker 1>the 19 year old Leon Van Dyke freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

1977
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 1>He did on a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 275 pounds,</v>

1978
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:18.350
<v Speaker 1>you will do curls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bizarre.</v>

1979
01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:23.351
<v Speaker 1>I would have him in an arm bar and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>better due to health because you </v>

1980
01:19:23.351 --> 01:19:26.741
<v Speaker 1>literally would start doing this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely strong and I started training </v>

1981
01:19:26.741 --> 01:19:26.741
<v Speaker 1>on both.</v>

1982
01:19:26.741 --> 01:19:28.760
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know anything and we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch tapes,</v>

1983
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I would watch tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see a hill who,</v>

1984
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will write down how it works.</v>

1985
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Next day we started rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will go.</v>

1986
01:19:34.731 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 1>He'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll look and say,</v>

1987
01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:37.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's break this down.</v>

1988
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how we can make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1989
01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:40.190
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you escape?</v>

1990
01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I push this way.</v>

1991
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can I stop you from doing this?</v>

1992
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And we start breaking down every little </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1993
01:19:44.991 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1994
01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Basically did it by yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch,</v>

1995
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every high level instruction at all.</v>

1996
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything myself and and you </v>

1997
01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.881
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the cool part because one </v>

1998
01:19:57.881 --> 01:19:59.580
<v Speaker 1>time I got a phone call by my big dvds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of combat come out and it was at the </v>

1999
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.701
<v Speaker 1>time and Bj fought med use all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and Bj call me and say,</v>

2000
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>hey boss is Bj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn.</v>

2001
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2002
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I owe this pleasure is I just </v>

2003
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:17.181
<v Speaker 3>want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made the best instruction that I've </v>

2004
01:20:17.181 --> 01:20:17.181
<v Speaker 3>ever seen as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so cool.</v>

2005
01:20:17.181 --> 01:20:17.181
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta go,</v>

2006
01:20:17.181 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I gotta do my run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She won't let me,</v>

2007
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:22.710
<v Speaker 3>can I use your quote?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's cool stuff.</v>

2008
01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 3>And I saw and I realized also that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people,</v>

2009
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fighters took everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight edge jujitsu and they put it </v>

2010
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 3>into mixed martial arts and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2011
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:36.381
<v Speaker 3>TwItter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu doesn't work in mixed martial </v>

2012
01:20:36.381 --> 01:20:36.381
<v Speaker 3>arts because it needs to be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>compact.</v>

2013
01:20:36.381 --> 01:20:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Like a sleeve will will take care that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's harder for you to roll out of an </v>

2014
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 3>arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why we are bars with me.</v>

2015
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 3>I always control the inside of the hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can rotate your hand,</v>

2016
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever are pretty much I do.</v>

2017
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 3>It's always control control because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want it to rotate,</v>

2018
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:55.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with helix and we start breaking </v>

2019
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.490
<v Speaker 3>everything down and I say okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I would tap him,</v>

2020
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:57.310
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with an arm bar from the mountain,</v>

2021
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm just making something up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>

2022
01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:04.430
<v Speaker 3>after three times she wouldn't know my </v>
<v Speaker 3>setup so I will create a different way </v>

2023
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:08.570
<v Speaker 3>to go to the down part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would find that out and then I will </v>

2024
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 3>create a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then suddenly I start for every move.</v>

2025
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I started havIng three or four different</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to go to that submission and ns.</v>

2026
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Scott dawson goes around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems so crazy.</v>

2027
01:21:14.671 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like you had to learn jujitsu on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own on my own to figure it out.</v>

2028
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Like look at how people are doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>deconstruct doing it.</v>

2029
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 3>And then my next eight fights I trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>for three months,</v>

2030
01:21:25.291 --> 01:21:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I think two times a day.</v>

2031
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I would wake up at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would call him and we will go wrong.</v>

2032
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I think I was always game always and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying and my next eight fights I </v>

2033
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 3>won by submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

2034
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when did you ever get real legitimate</v>

2035
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.620
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu instruction?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get someone who never.</v>

2036
01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Never in your whole career you're self </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught?</v>

2037
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2038
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.430
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2039
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:52.640
<v Speaker 3>And the cool part and then on our side </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because I'm very proud of it and </v>

2040
01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm saying it as you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the record in pancras,</v>

2041
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:56.100
<v Speaker 3>that rope escapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2042
01:21:56.101 --> 01:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>That means that if you could get an a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job but you could touch the rope there.</v>

2043
01:21:59.270 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 3>You have to let you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous.</v>

2044
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2045
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 3>but on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good for you as a fighter to</v>

2046
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:08.460
<v Speaker 3>develop because now you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>more strategical.</v>

2047
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to make sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been to center of the ring </v>

2048
01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:13.460
<v Speaker 3>before he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to then again,</v>

2049
01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.030
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna miss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the center of the ring.</v>

2050
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:19.130
<v Speaker 3>So there's more thinking with sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fIght with like for </v>

2051
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:22.761
<v Speaker 3>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of going out there I had now </v>

2052
01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:26.120
<v Speaker 3>for submission victories pretty much in </v>
<v Speaker 3>one fight and I think that that's why </v>

2053
01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.470
<v Speaker 3>the bankers guys were so good in ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think six or seven guys from pancreas </v>

2054
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:32.460
<v Speaker 3>became all ufc champion because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that rule.</v>

2055
01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 3>I truly believe I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's crazy.</v>

2056
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I always said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as I don't get have to escape </v>

2057
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:40.050
<v Speaker 3>because if I escape for me that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like a loss,</v>

2058
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even allowing them to escape to you.</v>

2059
01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 3>It's good because it just means you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more submission work in.</v>

2060
01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I have anoTher fight now we have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights that you feel like you won.</v>

2061
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 3>You won already and now let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it again.</v>

2062
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:59.300
<v Speaker 3>And then if you look at the waist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I submitted people you can call a </v>

2063
01:22:59.300 --> 01:22:59.300
<v Speaker 3>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2064
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.200
<v Speaker 3>A gogo blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it,</v>

2065
01:23:00.201 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 3>but you can come up witH some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2066
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 3>I put it every looked normally looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>verdun knee,</v>

2067
01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:06.270
<v Speaker 3>triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle</v>

2068
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:11.310
<v Speaker 4>arm or figure force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many fights did you have over in </v>

2069
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 4>pancreas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 31.</v>

2070
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Thirty one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over the course of how many years?</v>

2072
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:23.190
<v Speaker 4>That was only because of five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fought the first year of foot nine </v>

2073
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.570
<v Speaker 4>fights in the second nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again aid again.</v>

2074
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go.</v>

2075
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:31.831
<v Speaker 4>I thought that in a pretty short time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by the time you got to the ufc you </v>

2076

01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shamrock versus enovia.</v>

2193
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:50.270
<v Speaker 2>If I saw frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a radical tours debut,</v>

2194

<v Speaker 2>great fights,</v>

2196
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.830

<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>

2197
01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It was like I would make more money </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy than that.</v>

2198
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:03.500
<v Speaker 2>So it was a little too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was on news radio at the time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

2238
01:29:38.921 --> 01:29:43.921
<v Speaker 2>we're aware of pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pride in needle in the hay day was one </v>

2239
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:47.401
<v Speaker 2>of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the best organization in the </v>

2240
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:47.401
<v Speaker 2>world because they had so many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

2241
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:48.610
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of things that I like.</v>

2242
01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.650
<v Speaker 2>They had 10 minutes for the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I liked that because then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2244
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:57.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times the guy would take a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>down with five minutes into the fight </v>

2245
01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:57.250
<v Speaker 2>and then the round would end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2246
01:29:57.250 --> 01:30:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and he was Just starting to get imposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>his part of the game.</v>

2247
01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.110
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the pride rules,</v>

2248
01:30:02.111 --> 01:30:07.111
<v Speaker 2>they would give them a full 10 minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round and they allow soccer kicks </v>

2249
01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:10.591
<v Speaker 2>and stomps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lot more plays and no </v>

2250
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:10.591
<v Speaker 2>elbows on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No elbow.</v>

2251
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:10.591
<v Speaker 2>He had less cuts.</v>

2252
01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:12.290
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I always say.</v>

2253
01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to have the malone nice under </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and get away from the guts.</v>

2254
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:19.490
<v Speaker 1>We know how many nuggets that you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an elbow.</v>

2255
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five if that ever.</v>

2256
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good weapon.</v>

2257
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2258
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:26.130
<v Speaker 2>jon jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you use it on brandon vera,</v>

2259
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean he broke his.</v>

2260
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2261
01:30:27.661 --> 01:30:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but that was then one of the five name </v>
<v Speaker 1>miata for my money.</v>

2262
01:30:32.050 --> 01:30:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2263
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.720
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of fights get stopped by cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of guys and I hate that </v>

2264
01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:38.720
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the street.</v>

2265
01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't stop if you get a gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep fighting,</v>

2266
01:30:40.651 --> 01:30:45.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another real when I'm going to </v>

2267
01:30:45.651 --> 01:30:45.651
<v Speaker 1>discard guys who make careers out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2268
01:30:45.651 --> 01:30:49.490
<v Speaker 1>but still effective weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you can't take it away </v>

2269
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.650
<v Speaker 1>either because it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

2270
01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a good technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they.</v>

2271
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe what they should do is if you have</v>

2272
01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.670
<v Speaker 1>it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elbow pad.</v>

2273
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something around it that at least it </v>

2274
01:30:59.780 --> 01:30:59.780
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally for it.</v>

2275
01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>If you knock them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2276
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:05.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm the biggest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like laying on somebody and </v>

2277
01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 1>literally do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even load them up,</v>

2278
01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>just rub and rub and rub and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get gutted and they.</v>

2279
01:31:09.451 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>When a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2281
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you didn't a fight for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't mean that fight.</v>

2282
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they could solve that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a neoprene sleeve on the elbow?</v>

2283
01:31:16.581 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe with</v>

2284
01:31:17.150 --> 01:31:18.040
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2285
01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:20.950
<v Speaker 1>is like this crazy time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tie things that ever and you know,</v>

2286
01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:23.980
<v Speaker 1>that always starts moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran is going to be annoying.</v>

2287
01:31:23.981 --> 01:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>People get paid to be shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe surgically</v>

2288
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:32.570
<v Speaker 2>they have implant one surgically implant</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pad over your elbow,</v>

2289
01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:35.070
<v Speaker 2>man in saudi or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>

2290
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You're all fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've,</v>

2291
01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you did two fights in the ufc after you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won the title with random and what made </v>

2292
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you stop</v>

2293
01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:44.880
<v Speaker 1>pain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain.</v>

2294
01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:49.890
<v Speaker 1>So assuming that that neck injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought it all the way to the random </v>

2295
01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:51.650
<v Speaker 1>and fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still not gone.</v>

2296
01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I was hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't sleep.</v>

2297
01:31:53.691 --> 01:31:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sleeping pills for such a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because of the pain.</v>

2298
01:31:57.501 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>There was always pain pain in my neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2299
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.940
<v Speaker 3>then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2300
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start with biceps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like throwing the left.</v>

2301
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Who could the air park?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what's going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2304
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I stopped breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking down,</v>

2305
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 3>and then I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do anything.</v>

2306
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Then I started draining like three years</v>
<v Speaker 3>after that I started trading and it,</v>

2307
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 3>and it went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started going good,</v>

2308
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>and the ground started going good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2309
01:32:20.471 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything feels good.</v>

2310
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 3>And then I stopped and then like two </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later,</v>

2311
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Speaker 3>two and a half years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2312
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.430
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when they call me for the wfa,</v>

2313
01:32:30.431 --> 01:32:34.370
<v Speaker 3>if I was interested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they offered me a lot of money and uh,</v>

2314
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 3>and apparently what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny also because they,</v>

2315
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.940
<v Speaker 3>kimberly apolo to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

2316
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.320
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do you want to fight?</v>

2317
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hickson hixson.</v>

2318
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.090
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the money for that.</v>

2319
01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:47.650
<v Speaker 3>There's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2320
01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:49.720
<v Speaker 3>okay then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds crazy.</v>

2321
01:32:49.721 --> 01:32:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants millions.</v>

2322
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was at the time,</v>

2323
01:32:52.331 --> 01:32:57.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was just wanting to see what you </v>

2324
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:57.331
<v Speaker 3>can do against the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2325
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:57.850
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2326
01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.740
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would have been another awesome.</v>

2327
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.980
<v Speaker 3>That would've been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight you against mandalay or you go </v>

2328
01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.520
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a shame.</v>

2329
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I said,</v>

2330
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know,</v>

2331
01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2332
01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2333
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.760
<v Speaker 3>They said positive for steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:17.380
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did he said kimberly polish,</v>

2335
01:33:17.381 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2336
01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:23.161
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hang out with them in Japan when </v>

2337
01:33:23.161 --> 01:33:23.161
<v Speaker 3>he fought in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird if I know he actually</v>

2338
01:33:23.161 --> 01:33:23.161
<v Speaker 3>wants to find you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2339
01:33:23.161 --> 01:33:25.090
<v Speaker 3>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Then when we had the photo shoot,</v>

2340
01:33:25.091 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I go to the photo shoot and he's there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's acting all weird like giving me</v>

2341
01:33:28.391 --> 01:33:31.290
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like shying away and I go like a,</v>

2342
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.640
<v Speaker 3>he's taking his five very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2343
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2344
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We told him that you specifically asked </v>

2345
01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.521
<v Speaker 3>for him and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2346
01:33:41.890 --> 01:33:43.930
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to tell him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I thought,</v>

2347
01:33:43.931 --> 01:33:48.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to tell him because if I </v>

2348
01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:48.931
<v Speaker 3>tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2349
01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:52.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe he's not going to train as </v>

2350
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.070
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to have a tough fight,</v>

2351
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I thought he's angry,</v>

2352
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.950
<v Speaker 3>he's going to train harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be awesome,</v>

2353
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought that that was my,</v>

2354
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.340
<v Speaker 3>my crazy mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say on the day of the fight I would </v>

2355
01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:05.551
<v Speaker 3>deliver a letter to him into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dressing room saying exactly what I Just</v>

2356
01:34:05.651 --> 01:34:07.810
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would read like,</v>

2357
01:34:07.811 --> 01:34:12.811
<v Speaker 3>I knew this already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't want to tell you because I </v>

2358
01:34:12.811 --> 01:34:13.200
<v Speaker 3>want you to be 100 percent before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight me and,</v>

2359
01:34:13.201 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 3>and full of stamina because you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed and that way I think that will be</v>

2360
01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:19.240
<v Speaker 3>totally backfiring right away just </v>
<v Speaker 3>before your fight.</v>

2361
01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.550
<v Speaker 3>so that was the setup to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play.</v>

2362
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got tested positive.</v>

2363
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:27.040
<v Speaker 3>So that was rubin had to take his place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a lot of guys,</v>

2364
01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:29.170
<v Speaker 3>don't gabba didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a lot of,</v>

2365
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 3>bunch of guys they went over because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said anybody they gave,</v>

2366
01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.350
<v Speaker 3>they came up with that because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

2367
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.610
<v Speaker 3>it was just the only one who was willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the fine.</v>

2368
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2369
01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Now when you were over there in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were,</v>

2370
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.300
<v Speaker 2>were there for all those great finds </v>
<v Speaker 2>like nogueira versus a nogueira versus </v>

2371
01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.740
<v Speaker 2>cro cop and nogueira versus fade or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was that like sitting there?</v>

2372
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Ringside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2373
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 2>did you want to just fucking jump in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

2374
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's</v>

2375
01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.620
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get crazy.</v>

2376
01:34:54.621 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 3>You get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were over there for some of greatest</v>

2377
01:34:57.381 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>fights ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

2378
01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:03.850
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nobody gets to take that away from </v>

2379
01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they said.</v>

2380
01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 3>But my fights also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight the fights are beggars.</v>

2381
01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 3>And one guy in hollywood says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says bus.</v>

2382
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2383
01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 3>he's going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna lose.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2385
01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 3>like very negative public country.</v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever happens,</v>

2387
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.030
<v Speaker 3>they never take this away from you </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2388
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So look those up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and that's what were those fights also?</v>

2391
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:24.070
<v Speaker 3>That's something that you carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of your life they were </v>

2392
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.070
<v Speaker 3>great moments and to interview those </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

2394
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started doing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy opening,</v>

2404
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:35:50.071 --> 01:35:52.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they started bushido also,</v>

2408
01:35:52.111 --> 01:35:54.030
<v Speaker 4>I was there 12 times a month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year,</v>

2409
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.620
<v Speaker 4>a few month.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have no clue.</v>

2412
01:35:57.490 --> 01:36:00.750
<v Speaker 4>but during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must have been completely insane.</v>

2413
01:36:00.751 --> 01:36:05.751
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard stories about guys getting paid </v>

2414
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:05.751
<v Speaker 4>with stacks of money,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Exactly in a row.</v>

2417
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:11.930

<v Speaker 3>if they would walk in there with guns,</v>

2418
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.890
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that again,</v>

2419
01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:16.380
<v Speaker 4>don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's a lot of money there.</v>

2420
01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:19.140
<v Speaker 4>To pan is run by the yakuza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2421

<v Speaker 4>That's the whole deal with pride and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these organizations that basically.</v>

2422
01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a part of japanese culture.</v>

2423
01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is that just how it works?</v>

2424
01:36:26.191 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2425
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:26.680
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2426
01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:27.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2427
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not accepted because went when it </v>

2428
01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 4>came out</v>

2429
01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.650
<v Speaker 3>then it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right then regards to the tv set.</v>

2430
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:37.780
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to be associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they pulled the money out.</v>

2431
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Was that just because it was made public</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was already known,</v>

2432
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:43.040
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was made public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fit this,</v>

2433
01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.180
<v Speaker 4>forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a pass from joe rogan for a buddy</v>

2434
01:36:47.181 --> 01:36:49.790
<v Speaker 4>of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave him a ufc password.</v>

2435
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:51.350
<v Speaker 4>That's cooL.</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that your phone?</v>

2436
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:54.270

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.470
<v Speaker 4>my battery is too low for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2438
01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 4>Go have turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you were over there though,</v>

2439
01:37:00.951 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 4>when you were watching all these classic</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights and then like I said,</v>

2440
01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:06.800
<v Speaker 4>you'd been there for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you were there for shogun,</v>

2441
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:11.801
<v Speaker 4>Mark Coleman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were there for show gun versus </v>

2442
01:37:11.801 --> 01:37:11.810
<v Speaker 4>rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rampage versus a rona.</v>

2443
01:37:11.811 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of the greatest fights of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all time,</v>

2444
01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:16.110
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rampage.</v>

2445
01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 3>The things that be dead with rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

2446
01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:23.740
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my first when he fought </v>

2447
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.190
<v Speaker 3>sakuraba and he lost that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took him to the side.</v>

2448
01:37:25.191 --> 01:37:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2449
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.880
<v Speaker 3>you got it man.</v>

2450
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.380
<v Speaker 3>they love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

2451
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 3>make sure this doesn't happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they actually had to get him out</v>

2452
01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:38.321
<v Speaker 3>of jail to get that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a whole stress thing going on </v>

2453
01:37:38.321 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a,</v>

2454
01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:44.100
<v Speaker 3>he had a warrant out of him or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was at the airport and they got </v>

2455
01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:44.570
<v Speaker 3>them and they put them in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

2456
01:37:44.571 --> 01:37:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the deprived people started talking.</v>

2457
01:37:46.161 --> 01:37:48.050
<v Speaker 3>They got them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made pictures of it.</v>

2458
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:52.330
<v Speaker 3>He standing in front of the jail was </v>
<v Speaker 3>undercover of the newspapers.</v>

2459
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Was he standing there with his big </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain?</v>

2460
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2461
01:37:55.471 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 3>that was</v>

2462
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.710
<v Speaker 4>that script and he came in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the prime,</v>

2463
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:03.770
<v Speaker 4>what was going on back then at that time</v>
<v Speaker 4>was pride was a mainstream japanese </v>

2464
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 4>sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was huge in mainstream Japan,</v>

2465
01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like mma,</v>

2466
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts in America back then </v>
<v Speaker 4>was not nearly as successful as it is </v>

2467
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:17.400
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A small show was 43,000</v>

2468
01:38:17.401 --> 01:38:19.550
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

2469
01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:24.090
<v Speaker 4>And they would sell out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it could show 91 and a half.</v>

2470
01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 4>Tokyo dome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>55,</v>

2471
01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 4>60,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was crazy.</v>

2472
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 4>And you would go out on the street and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were getting mom.</v>

2473
01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.830
<v Speaker 4>There was no everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2474
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 4>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened over there?</v>

2475
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Because it stopped being like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It stopped being like,</v>

2476
01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:38.880
<v Speaker 4>because of that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

2477
01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:40.080
<v Speaker 4>Because the accuser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:40.830
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2479
01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.340
<v Speaker 4>when the tv pulled everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was over.</v>

2480
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:46.390
<v Speaker 4>That's when everything went down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>dread.</v>

2481
01:38:46.391 --> 01:38:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It was so successful.</v>

2482
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:52.670
<v Speaker 4>So many people liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine that someone else </v>

2483
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:52.670
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't come along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2484
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:52.670
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2485
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:52.670
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2486
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:56.510
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the main reason of this </v>

2487
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 4>sakharova started to lose you like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization in Japan in order to be </v>

2488
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:03.610
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need japanese star star and,</v>

2489
01:39:03.611 --> 01:39:06.970
<v Speaker 4>and where are you going to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck to find another sec.</v>

2490
01:39:06.971 --> 01:39:11.220
<v Speaker 4>Robert who beat for grace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not unbelievable fighter,</v>

2491
01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:16.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has k one never got big in </v>

2492
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.370
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2493
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:18.990
<v Speaker 4>They don't have an american champion </v>
<v Speaker 4>debit american champions in America.</v>

2494
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:20.570
<v Speaker 4>K one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

2495
01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.280
<v Speaker 4>that guy doeSn't do good in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the final tournament.</v>

2496
01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:28.630
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one's an american guy is going to </v>

2497
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:28.630
<v Speaker 4>read in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You watch.</v>

2498
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Then k one becomes very interesting for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people in his logic.</v>

2499
01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:32.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to root for your own guy.</v>

2500
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.900
<v Speaker 4>That's funny though because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean horse crazy when he wanted America.</v>

2501
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.540
<v Speaker 4>He was a hugely popular guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Brazil.</v>

2502
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I think if they had k one over in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2503
01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 4>I just think people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2504
01:39:43.381 --> 01:39:48.381
<v Speaker 4>dana white and I had a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this and he was talking about how </v>

2505
01:39:48.381 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 4>his kickboxing as a negative stigma in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America because of pka karate,</v>

2506
01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.990
<v Speaker 4>old boring kickboxing is to have en esa </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks above the waist or something.</v>

2507
01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.710
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't even kIck low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kick low at all.</v>

2508
01:39:58.711 --> 01:40:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Very few of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they would occasionally,</v>

2509
01:40:00.571 --> 01:40:04.790
<v Speaker 4>they would show you a low kick fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>with special rules or special rule dutch</v>

2510
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:10.730
<v Speaker 4>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like they would wear those big </v>

2511
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:10.730
<v Speaker 4>stupid slippers on their feet and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't really care.</v>

2512
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't nearly as exciting as boxing </v>

2513
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 4>or more time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the one now,</v>

2514
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.340
<v Speaker 4>if you watched the grand prix now that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>

2515
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 4>So she'll ever so exciting.</v>

2516
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:21.270
<v Speaker 4>But asher and max as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2517
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:24.440
<v Speaker 4>the lighter weight guys and your patrol </v>
<v Speaker 4>zen.</v>

2518
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable,</v>

2519
01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:30.921
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me that I couldn't be a star in </v>

2520
01:40:30.921 --> 01:40:30.921
<v Speaker 4>America or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2521
01:40:30.921 --> 01:40:30.921
<v Speaker 4>allister especially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:40:30.921 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is in the beginning it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will work,</v>

2523
01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:36.990
<v Speaker 4>but eventually people want to see an </v>
<v Speaker 4>american american champion.</v>

2524
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it,</v>

2525
01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:39.510
<v Speaker 4>if it was really big and successful over</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2526
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:40.260
<v Speaker 4>you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2527
01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.920
<v Speaker 4>some americans that would do well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they would have to,</v>

2528
01:40:43.190 --> 01:40:46.330
<v Speaker 4>they would have to know that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate avenue for professional,</v>

2529
01:40:47.110 --> 01:40:48.320
<v Speaker 4>that barry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2530
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:50.850
<v Speaker 4>guys who are real serious fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikers,</v>

2531
01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:52.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just not that many of them.</v>

2532
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 4>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2533
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.160
<v Speaker 1>just really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2534
01:40:55.170 --> 01:40:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2535
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:57.850
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America it's just,</v>

2536
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:02.851
<v Speaker 1>there's no venue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to go out out of the country </v>

<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

2667
01:45:52.171 --> 01:45:53.540

<v Speaker 3>this is like a roller bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie this people gonna need like </v>

01:45:58.570 --> 01:46:00.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be very big.</v>

2671
01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I say you're watching four years from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:08.861
<v Speaker 3>I said to four years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will be the biggest thing and it </v>

2674
01:46:08.861 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 3>was like seven years later or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like way off in time,</v>

2675
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:11.300
<v Speaker 3>but eventually it got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go like,</v>

2676
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is better than this?</v>

2677
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.280
<v Speaker 3>I knew at that time already that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody likes to be to know who's the </v>

2678
01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:20.090
<v Speaker 3>toughest guy on the planet and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally being the toughest guy.</v>

2679
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I was an inside man made last week and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was ashamed about a comment that I made </v>

2680
01:46:25.330 --> 01:46:27.360
<v Speaker 3>against frank because we had a comment </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2681
01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 3>One guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2682
01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:32.450
<v Speaker 3>we're mma is just like two guys rubbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against each other on the floor.</v>

2683
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And then I told him the story that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting frank and that,</v>

2684
01:46:35.921 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stood up and I said to frank,</v>

2685
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:38.690
<v Speaker 3>come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2686
01:46:38.691 --> 01:46:38.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2687
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 3>you come down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have come up fight like a </v>

2688
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2689
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.020
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating those words right now because</v>

2690
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:50.050
<v Speaker 3>when I broke that guy shin bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had no clue how much power </v>

2691
01:46:50.050 --> 01:46:50.630
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't the joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2692
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.580
<v Speaker 3>that really started making me think and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood it.</v>

2693
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 3>The ground guy can break whatever he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants in your body.</v>

2694
01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 3>You got so much dominant power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I roll with guys,</v>

2695
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.090
<v Speaker 3>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rot a stand with me.</v>

2696
01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Then the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the grant,</v>

2697
01:47:04.341 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 3>they say you always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're there standing,</v>

2698
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:08.640
<v Speaker 3>they can move around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2699
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.320
<v Speaker 3>and they get hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2700
01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:12.930
<v Speaker 3>but It's way harder underground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go like,</v>

2701
01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>break,</v>

2703
01:47:15.511 --> 01:47:17.310

<v Speaker 3>I can do whatever I want.</v>

2704
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:18.210
<v Speaker 3>If I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2705
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:21.660
<v Speaker 3>your right arm is going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your right arm is going to go to any guy</v>

2706
01:47:21.661 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 3>on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2707
01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean talking about power compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking somebody out,</v>

2708
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:31.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can put you to sleep back in some </v>

2709
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:31.100
<v Speaker 3>crazy things with you</v>

2710
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.350
<v Speaker 2>stated the jujitsu that just came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just came out of nowhere.</v>

2711
01:47:32.351 --> 01:47:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

2712
01:47:33.251 --> 01:47:36.290
<v Speaker 2>it was all about striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no one ever took judo.</v>

2713
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrestled in high school,</v>

2714
01:47:38.021 --> 01:47:39.910
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did it as a sport,</v>

2715
01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:45.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got bored with it quick because it </v>

2716
01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:45.340
<v Speaker 2>just didn't seem like does anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

2717
01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:45.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy down.</v>

2718
01:47:45.641 --> 01:47:50.641
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't submitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>submitting them and once jujitsu came </v>

2719
01:47:50.641 --> 01:47:50.641
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2720
01:47:50.641 --> 01:47:52.960
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how much it's evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at like mma,</v>

2721
01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.690
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an mma in 93.</v>

2722
01:47:55.691 --> 01:47:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And look at the digital you see now with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chalk ray,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2724
01:47:59.831 --> 01:48:02.380
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking so many levels above it.</v>

2725
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:03.860
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I always say,</v>

2726
01:48:03.861 --> 01:48:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I say all the moves are pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented,</v>

2727
01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:07.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the setups.</v>

2728
01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 3>THey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found creative ways to go to a </v>

2729
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.731
<v Speaker 3>particular move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the cool part about mixed </v>

2730
01:48:15.731 --> 01:48:17.921
<v Speaker 3>martial arts style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have that setup that nobody </v>

<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was sitting looking at and he was</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's so many different techniques and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people don't understand that don't </v>

2783

<v Speaker 2>do jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different techniques </v>

2784
01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:25.150
<v Speaker 2>that are available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

2785
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a million pieces,</v>

2786
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 2>so many different submissions and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different transitions and chains of</v>

2787
01:50:32.291 --> 01:50:34.770
<v Speaker 2>submissions and new techniques and new </v>
<v Speaker 2>counters and.</v>

2788
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2789
01:50:35.511 --> 01:50:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in as good to know them all.</v>

2790
01:50:38.101 --> 01:50:40.440
<v Speaker 3>But I mean for every fight you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2791
01:50:40.441 --> 01:50:45.441
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use this particular mode </v>

2792
01:50:45.441 --> 01:50:45.441
<v Speaker 3>for that guy.</v>

2793
01:50:45.441 --> 01:50:47.610

<v Speaker 3>and then have those different setups.</v>

2794
01:50:47.611 --> 01:50:52.611
<v Speaker 3>That is the key man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would end set up one to four and go </v>

2795
01:50:52.611 --> 01:50:52.611
<v Speaker 3>from one to four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the funnIest things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to ever do another one?</v>

2834
01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:13.201
<v Speaker 3>theft auto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just sit there to watch his </v>

2835
01:52:13.201 --> 01:52:15.511
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His boss was and gta for that was as a </v>

2836
01:52:17.031 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 3>disguise from bar fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They saw it and what they did,</v>

2837
01:52:20.201 --> 01:52:25.201
<v Speaker 3>they gave me a script and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I tweak this thing and just say </v>

2838
01:52:25.201 --> 01:52:27.881
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would start building sentences in </v>

2839
01:52:27.881 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would stop and then restart it.</v>

2840
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:32.710

<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2919
01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's not do it.</v>

2920
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.790

<v Speaker 2>saying that he's going to get right back</v>

2921
01:55:26.791 --> 01:55:28.110
<v Speaker 2>in there and they're just going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2922
01:55:28.111 --> 01:55:30.330
<v Speaker 2>and he did did some things wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not done.</v>

2923
01:55:30.331 --> 01:55:32.280
<v Speaker 2>He's going to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be even sweeter than ever.</v>

2924
01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:33.570
<v Speaker 2>And I'm listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking.</v>

2925
01:55:33.571 --> 01:55:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

2926
01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.710

<v Speaker 2>unconscious times in a row?</v>

2927
01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Can you can kill everything for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest?</v>

2928
01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2929
01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:43.000

<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be a teacher.</v>

2930
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes more sense that that's the </v>

2931
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.290
<v Speaker 3>bad thing also is like your legacy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going down.</v>

2932
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:53.001
<v Speaker 3>When are you going to be a coach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go to a gym to train </v>

2933
01:55:53.001 --> 01:55:53.130
<v Speaker 3>with a guy who lost his lost seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

2934
01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:57.060

<v Speaker 3>What I said,</v>

2938
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:03.660
<v Speaker 3>what a should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should tell him,</v>

2939
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:04.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2940
01:56:04.251 --> 01:56:06.150
<v Speaker 3>as you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to fight for a year and</v>

2941
01:56:06.151 --> 01:56:11.151
<v Speaker 3>in between we're going to do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>grappling tournaments to keep the </v>

2942
01:56:11.151 --> 01:56:13.311
<v Speaker 3>competition on there and if you're busy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't matter if you've been on </v>

2943
01:56:13.311 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 3>those who cares about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be busy with competition so you,</v>

2944
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 3>you perform under pressure and then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything feels good,</v>

2945
01:56:17.911 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 3>you know that maybe try it one more </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2946
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 3>but then really say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2947
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:23.840
<v Speaker 3>if this is going to go the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really get a stop light.</v>

2948
01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:26.780
<v Speaker 4>You're off from the rogers fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't.</v>

2949
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the 10th in my book,</v>

2950
01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.220
<v Speaker 4>if I lost my student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was no.</v>

2951
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:36.520
<v Speaker 4>I would say no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has been shut off too many times </v>

2952
01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.890
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to be that nail and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gulf that's going to say god knows </v>

2953
01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:41.741
<v Speaker 4>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about a guy like alastar that got </v>

2954
01:56:41.741 --> 01:56:43.991
<v Speaker 4>stopped a bunch of times.</v>

2955
01:56:43.991 --> 01:56:45.110
<v Speaker 4>times in his career.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Dell knocked him out.</v>

2957
01:56:46.521 --> 01:56:48.920
<v Speaker 4>So many guys stomped him and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2958
01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2964
01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:59.100

<v Speaker 3>four shots pop pop up.</v>

2966
01:57:01.001 --> 01:57:03.450
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is single shots.</v>

2967
01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:06.630
<v Speaker 3>His defense is perfectly boomp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boomp boomp.</v>

2968
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:09.730

2996
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 3>but I always said that's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys because they,</v>

2997
01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:12.460
<v Speaker 3>they keep them coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep them coming and want more and </v>

2998
01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:12.540
<v Speaker 3>travel for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants it and the guy who really wants</v>

2999
01:58:12.541 --> 01:58:13.980
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is like that.</v>

3000
01:58:13.981 --> 01:58:18.981
<v Speaker 3>It's like the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say the alchemists know if you </v>

3001
01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:18.981
<v Speaker 3>set your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

3002
01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:19.770
<v Speaker 3>that's where I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you do,</v>

3003
01:58:19.771 --> 01:58:22.320
<v Speaker 3>you don't get off the path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you are going to get it.</v>

3004
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I truly believed that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there that helps you for that.</v>

3005
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:27.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

3006
01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:32.630
<v Speaker 3>go relentless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't walk over people though in order </v>

3007
01:58:32.630 --> 01:58:32.630
<v Speaker 3>to get there.</v>

3008
01:58:32.630 --> 01:58:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're andre arlovski and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been enough four times in a row.</v>

3009
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:35.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3010
01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:38.630
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But physically you have to stop and look</v>

3011
01:58:38.631 --> 01:58:40.220
<v Speaker 4>at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

3012
01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3013
01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:44.890
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you say this.</v>

3014
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 4>I think that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you tell when to tell them?</v>

3015
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that people inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep down inside the foreigners know if </v>

3016
01:58:53.010 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 3>they can become a champion or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they already know that.</v>

3017
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.610
<v Speaker 3>When I was finding and I started winning</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Japan,</v>

3018
01:58:57.611 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 3>when I get that ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at my wife,</v>

3019
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I say I think are going to be a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion for this thing.</v>

3020
01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I truly believe I can beat all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys now.</v>

3021
01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it started,</v>

3022
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you feel that.</v>

3023
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that that a fighter will </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually knows himself.</v>

3024
01:59:10.751 --> 01:59:12.490
<v Speaker 3>They will keep on trying and keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>

3025
01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 3>but I think once you know that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>really there,</v>

3026
01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:18.910
<v Speaker 3>that that's not a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't say it,</v>

3027
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:21.220
<v Speaker 3>but it is just like the guy who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>mount,</v>

3028
01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you hit the turn onto begging to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>choked.</v>

3029
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:26.070
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these guys they give to joe.</v>

3030
01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you think about the fate of our</v>

3031
01:59:27.871 --> 01:59:29.610
<v Speaker 4>fight when frito was fighting a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot?</v>

3032
01:59:29.611 --> 01:59:31.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean he gave up his back a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

3033
01:59:31.231 --> 01:59:33.300
<v Speaker 4>He had to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just too big.</v>

3034
01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:34.290
<v Speaker 4>It was too big</v>

3035

<v Speaker 3>And then being what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty pounds heavier or you know,</v>

3039

<v Speaker 4>like that's a giant person may get </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped by a big foot.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You can see the footprint still on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Poor fader man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seeing guys like at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at their most vibrant when they're just </v>

3086
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.560
<v Speaker 4>dominant part with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with chuck,</v>

3087
02:01:14.561 --> 02:01:17.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a mental thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also with chuck,</v>

3088
02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:22.110
<v Speaker 4>if he has the right person who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who can talk to him that he's still </v>

3089
02:01:22.110 --> 02:01:22.430
<v Speaker 4>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if he lands,</v>

3090
02:01:22.431 --> 02:01:24.590
<v Speaker 4>if he smells the victory he committee </v>

02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:35.530
<v Speaker 4>This guy is still to be the top guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his only defect with him.</v>

3095
02:01:35.531 --> 02:01:38.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not that he lost his timing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost that.</v>

3096
02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 4>It's only that he too hungry,</v>

3101
02:01:50.231 --> 02:01:53.411
<v Speaker 3>everybody backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sunday when couture came and </v>

<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have had that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3178
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:34.270
<v Speaker 3>be very realistic to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about a guy like randy </v>

3186
02:04:50.341 --> 02:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3187
02:04:50.801 --> 02:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I came up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3188
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>when I was 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around that time I had very bad asthma,</v>

3189
02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>but I also did track and field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I had an asthma attack that will</v>

3190
02:05:00.151 --> 02:05:03.060
<v Speaker 1>be like a two week episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which of the two,</v>

3191
02:05:03.061 --> 02:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>which I will be like five or six days in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed because I couldn't eat.</v>

3192
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't breathe because she can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

3193
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>She drink it because they'd like this 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours day.</v>

3194
02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really bad,</v>

3195
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:16.680
<v Speaker 1>so I couldn't watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

3196
02:05:16.681 --> 02:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any of that anymore?</v>

3197
02:05:18.841 --> 02:05:19.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3198
02:05:19.321 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I do.</v>

3199
02:05:20.251 --> 02:05:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3200
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but you take an inhaler and it's gone.</v>

3201
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:27.600
<v Speaker 1>But then after I had an attack and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do track and field,</v>

3202
02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I would realize that my launch would </v>
<v Speaker 1>work better and I go,</v>

3203
02:05:31.111 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3204
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.590
<v Speaker 1>oh wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infection in your long pipe,</v>

3205
02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it closes the long pipe.</v>

3206
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Your launch have to work really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that erin.</v>

3207
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Then when the infection is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they at all because they worked</v>

3208
02:05:43.531 --> 02:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>all the time to use to pulling heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air comes in egg.</v>

3209
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't I come up with something </v>

3210
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 1>that controls the air intake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started thinking about like,</v>

3211
02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the stupidest thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to learn.</v>

3212
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I will put my mouth in a shortened </v>
<v Speaker 1>position and try to memorize that </v>

3213
02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:03.281
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just stupid stuff so much aaron </v>

3214
02:06:03.281 --> 02:06:04.410
<v Speaker 1>like and then every time a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller I go,</v>

3215
02:06:04.411 --> 02:06:05.490
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta come up with something.</v>

3216
02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So I tell all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my buddies here in America,</v>

3217
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew and the holidays also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted to make that thing.</v>

3218
02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And then when vandelay came on tv with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>snorkel,</v>

3219
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I think I had six or seven phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said you gotta do that thing that </v>

3220
02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about because somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna find it out.</v>

3221
02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:24.630

02:06:36.250 --> 02:06:38.010
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was laughing because what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this,</v>

3227
02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:42.930
<v Speaker 1>let's do a trainer and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it controls the air intake.</v>

3228
02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a very simple thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this week you do all your </v>

3229
02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:51.891
<v Speaker 1>hard workouts like only four times also </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't need to do it anyway </v>

3230
02:06:51.891 --> 02:06:53.340
<v Speaker 1>because she actually toning your muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>to testing it.</v>

3231
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:56.520
<v Speaker 1>In Texas right now at a university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy in 12 days,</v>

3232
02:06:56.521 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 1>he had greater lung volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3233
02:06:58.171 --> 02:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made something really cool.</v>

3234
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Can I puT my trek team on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his female trek demonic,</v>

3235
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna run tests on them now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks also that because it's</v>

3236
02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:11.121
<v Speaker 1>a little small dive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biodegradable little compartment that's </v>

3237
02:07:11.121 --> 02:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>flexible also should get get hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you rebreathe a little tiny bit </v>

3238
02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.260
<v Speaker 1>of carbon monoxide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wanted to stay away from because</v>

3239
02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3240
02:07:17.371 --> 02:07:17.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3241
02:07:17.731 --> 02:07:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't get carbon dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would I want it to.</v>

3242
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

3243
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:27.570
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it's just enough to spark a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more red blood cell production.</v>

3244
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kidding me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I die.</v>

3247

3276
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be the maJor </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact because you look at it,</v>

3277
02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:39.540
<v Speaker 3>describe what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3278
02:08:39.670 --> 02:08:42.820
<v Speaker 3>This is a portable device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mouthpiece,</v>

3279
02:08:42.821 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 3>like in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you die you don't let struggle</v>

3280
02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 3>and it got to the front with two little </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3281
02:08:47.670 --> 02:08:52.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like a square and it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front here as the air a whole.</v>

3282
02:08:52.081 --> 02:08:54.850
<v Speaker 3>And as a cap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cap you can take off and you can put</v>

3283
02:08:54.851 --> 02:08:57.970
<v Speaker 3>screens in their little rubber screens </v>

3284
02:08:57.971 --> 02:09:00.460
<v Speaker 3>they go from 40 millimeter all the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to one millimeter.</v>

3285
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:03.430
<v Speaker 3>So this week you train all your hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>work has 14 millimeter.</v>

3286
02:09:03.431 --> 02:09:06.390

3287
02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.670

<v Speaker 3>And then once you're down you know,</v>
