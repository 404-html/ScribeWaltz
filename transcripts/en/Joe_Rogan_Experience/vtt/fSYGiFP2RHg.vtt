<v Speaker 1>And I'm just sitting there smiling,</v>

123
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>shaking my head at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

126
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>You have no fucking authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hit me.</v>

127
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on fucking something.</v>

128
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not getting that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that guy had a vibe like he's going</v>

129
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>to punch me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been up in the,</v>

130
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't.</v>

131
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>He just had like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a kid throwing a temper</v>

132
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted like this,</v>

133
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you want to seem like he wanted to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>army ranger,</v>

134
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't quite make it or what'd he</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>

135
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>He was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we doing in good shape?</v>

136
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>You know why Redo white dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude who shot that Trayvon Martin</v>

137
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>kid who wasn't really a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

138
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to be a cop so he took it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next level and it's the same.</v>

139
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I could have squashed the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just been like,</v>

140
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian,</v>

141
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to Indianapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'd like to come out to the show,</v>

142
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I could have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a dick and I hate,</v>

143
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I hate fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate authority and this guy doesn't</v>

144
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck him.</v>

145
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.210

<v Speaker 1>button.</v>

146
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So then the stewardess comes over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

147
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:46.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

148
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>He goes to sky is a flight risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not comfortable flying with him,</v>

149
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>but Baba Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baba and all the shit.</v>

150
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised how few people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking around.</v>

151
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>People were just kind of sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy was wigging out and I'm</v>

152
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>just sitting there and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stewardess was like,</v>

153
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did anybody else see any behavior?</v>

154
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And The lady was sitting in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

155
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>pointed at him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

156
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>he was berating any point and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed me,</v>

157
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was berating him and I'm just like,</v>

158
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm literally putting my fucking ims</v>

159
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>down as I'm talking to him just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

160
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a guy trying to go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis.</v>

161
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>This guy's drinking doers and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping the F bomb.</v>

162
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:16.691
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

163
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I said bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.340
<v Speaker 1>prominent and there wasn't a problem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just doing this thing where</v>

165
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>he wants to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants some sort of recognition of</v>

166
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck he thinks he is still</v>

167
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

168
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>At this point it fucking stopped.</v>

169
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It pulled over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that part.</v>

170
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It pulled over and stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

171
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking red eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>It stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another stewards comes over and he goes,</v>

173
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes through the whole fucking</v>

174
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the end it's like basically</v>

175
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the captain at this point is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I really have to come back there?</v>

176
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like really the red eye fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight.</v>

177
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>My last flight of the day I used to fly</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat missions,</v>

178

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to deal with this bullshit.</v>

180
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Do I really have to come back there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they finally asked him,</v>

181
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.261
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

182
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be comfortable flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this guy?</v>

183
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.970

<v Speaker 1>some sort of something there.</v>

185
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>So cause you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that it's okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just put whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like some sort of power that</v>

00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I got my eye thing on and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and he's yapping in my</v>

<v Speaker 1>such hacky interrogation.</v>

223
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:29.870

229
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then five minutes of silence,</v>

230
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes of silence goes by and I'm</v>
