00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Bom Bom four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Ben Greenfield eats ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just want everybody to know,</v>

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to go to Disney as much </v>

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>as you go to Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd eat a lot more black ants.</v>

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Why are you eating it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly I actually don't know that </v>

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>much about dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just eating it because it supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you energy.</v>

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I need to pick me up this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lifted the waste this morning and I </v>

10
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.181
<v Speaker 1>needed a second boost of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently these ants live in </v>

11
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:32.721
<v Speaker 1>Ginseng roots and they have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grows in their heads that acts as </v>

12
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:37.551
<v Speaker 1>like a nootropic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some kind of a chemical </v>

13
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.651
<v Speaker 1>nootropic and it also supposedly is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these Chinese energy tonics.</v>

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the doctrine of signatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:48.501
<v Speaker 1>the doctrine of signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the idea that that things in </v>

17
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>nature give you clues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like when you slice open a tomato,</v>

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got the four chambers of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart and tomato,</v>

20
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>supposedly good for the hearts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pomegranate is good for your blood.</v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And the little pomegranate seeds look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like red blood cells.</v>

22
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>You slice open a carrot that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eye or you,</v>

23
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you crack open an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like an eye.</v>

24
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are good for your vision.</v>

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potatoes,</v>

26
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>which everybody thinks is like at like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>

27
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.821
<v Speaker 1>sugary food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are actually shaped like a </v>

28
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>pancreas and they can actually help to </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalize your,</v>

29
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>your Beta cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

30
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>your insulin producing Beta cells in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pancreas.</v>

31
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So you're looking at walnuts for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and people talk about a Aba </v>

32
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Cahtos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:31.881
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly they look a little bit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ovary and they're good for female </v>

34
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>reproductive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

35
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you can carry that over from the plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom into the animal kingdom and say </v>

36
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.591
<v Speaker 1>that if you eat ants because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>such energetic endurance driven </v>

37
00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>creatures that it supposedly will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stronger.</v>

38
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stretch.</v>

39
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait til this stuff hits me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

40
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find that.</v>

41
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Have you been doing it for awhile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been taking this </v>

42
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the third time I've,</v>

43
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I've actually used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just send dissolve.</v>

44
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it for workout a couple of times.</v>

45
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So this is your concoction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You took ground but ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grind up the answer myself.</v>

47
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>That would have been exhausting to catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>you by the up.</v>

48
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I bought ground up black ant powder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pulled up some Ginseng.</v>

49
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're called.</v>

50
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I bought them.</v>

51
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last part,</v>

52
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Paulie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Righteous ants.</v>

53
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>A Qi tonic of Chinese herbalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

54
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese people are also into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhino Horn.</v>

55
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a pre workout or according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the website.</v>

56
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a pre workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Herbs,</v>

57
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>a super supposedly far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically super regular food.</v>

58
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a super food.</v>

59
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little annoyed with that word.</v>

60
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

61
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I like that idea though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the doctrine of signatures.</v>

62
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Rarer like certain things that I see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature being good for you.</v>

63
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one called,</v>

64
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the,</v>

65
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of this plant,</v>

66
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's called the insulin of the heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's amazing for decreasing </v>

67
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.241
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic nervous system activation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and causing you to relax and it has </v>

68
00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:02.871
<v Speaker 1>these beneficial cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties and people who are just so </v>

69
00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>driven that they tend to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

70
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heart attack or an emi and it's uh,</v>

71
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lance thies,</v>

72
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of this but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like a heart and it has all</v>

73
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>these red vessels that kind of come off </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

74
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's called the insulin of the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.990
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an APP that my kids and I used </v>

76
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>to identify a lot of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called flower checker.</v>

77
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So you read about this and stuff online </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you started taking it and then </v>

78
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you mix it in some sort of a tincture </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

79
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Just vodka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urbane that stuff nature.</v>

81
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>But forgotten remedy for heart disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>bay.</v>

82
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And I interviewed a physician on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

83
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Dr Thomas Cowan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book about how the heart </v>

84
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>is not a pump and he talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>true reason for heart disease,</v>

85
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>being sympathetic nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 1>overdrive,</v>

86
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he mean by the hardest,</v>

87
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.950
<v Speaker 1>not a pump mineral depletion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydration and what he means by the </v>

88
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>heart is not a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating book.</v>

89
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>The shape of the chest is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's called like a tetrahedron</v>

90
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.891
<v Speaker 1>or some something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically as fluid moves through the</v>

91
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.931
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the action of the fluid actually moving </v>

92
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:18.841
<v Speaker 1>through the heart allows it to pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the heart and not have to be </v>

93
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>pumped through the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the shape of the heart is </v>

94
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>almost like causing the fluid to move in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vortex.</v>

95
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And so most certainly out of the oh the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

96
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>the heart contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

97
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's less of a pumping action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of like a,</v>

98
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>like a vortex flow that it creates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A book's called why your heart is not a </v>

99
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

100
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it why well received amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

101
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>It kind of flies under the radar a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

102
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

103
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting book.</v>

104
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Short book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe pages loan universally </v>

105
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>regarded as a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would necessarily classify it as </v>

107
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>a pump as much as a contracting muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that boom,</v>

108
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

109
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>but when you die and then they bring you</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to life,</v>

110
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they push your heart to make it pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pump,</v>

111
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump,</v>

112
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump seems good.</v>

113
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

114
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Shit and read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

115
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

116
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>this flower checker app is flower </v>
<v Speaker 1>checker APP.</v>

118
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

119
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you take a picture of a plant and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a team of live botanists on the </v>

120
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.621
<v Speaker 1>other end and within 24 hours they </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify the plant for you and you can </v>

121
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>learn it's edible properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's medicinal property.</v>

122
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So my kids and I can walk around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take pictures of different plants,</v>

123
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>different flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things on our land,</v>

124
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and it develops this online or Barium </v>
<v Speaker 1>that then allows you to keep track of </v>

125
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>all the different plants and what you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned about them and what they're good</v>

126
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:52.711
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we use that whenever we're </v>

127
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:55.021
<v Speaker 1>identifying plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one time when we were fishing </v>

128
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.021
<v Speaker 1>off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the,</v>

129
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the north fork of the clearwater.</v>

130
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.990
<v Speaker 1>So we went on this fly trip and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting</v>

131
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>this water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clearwater up in Idaho.</v>

132
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 2>So we were near a Grangeville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people fly into Grangeville,</v>

133
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great fly fishing,</v>

134
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>huge steelhead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

135
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hike that we went on,</v>

136
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:13.020
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have our phones or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>with us to take pictures of,</v>

137
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.210
<v Speaker 2>of what we were finding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we found this,</v>

138
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 2>this enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a field of wild asparagus,</v>

140
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my buddy who was with us,</v>

141
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 2>he had bear broth that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was,</v>

142
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 2>it was like a bare bone broth that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had in this vat back at the cabin.</v>

143
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:34.321
<v Speaker 2>So we harvested all this asparagus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was before it went out fishing and </v>

144
00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I put all the asparagus into the bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>broth and then just left for the day.</v>

145
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>And then we came back and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had fish,</v>

146
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:43.661
<v Speaker 2>we had bone broth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had asparagus and we all ate this </v>

147
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>bone broth and it turns out that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff was not asparagus.</v>

148
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 2>So my kids in our heads were spinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>all night.</v>

149
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>The guy that owned the cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently he didn't sleep,</v>

150
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.531
<v Speaker 2>he was just like hunched over the toilet</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole evening and it turns out this </v>

151
00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 2>stuff is cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Brassica,</v>

152
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Asparagus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it has very high levels </v>

153
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.311
<v Speaker 2>of nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were all career dosed on nicotine </v>

154
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>for the next two days on this fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip to be really careful.</v>

155
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the only time I haven't used that</v>
<v Speaker 2>APP to actually go,</v>

156
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 2>go plant food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who thought it was asparagus?</v>

157
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>We all thought it was asparagus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the chefs who is out of the cabin</v>

159
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 2>my kids and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and twin nine year old boys know a lot </v>

161
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 2>about plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we always trumps the wild asparagus.</v>

162
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:30.480
<v Speaker 2>But I was convinced it was asparagus.</v>

163
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of tasted it out there where we </v>

164
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were out in the field and it tasted </v>

165
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 2>like asparagus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

166
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not asparagus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Brassica Jesus Christ.</v>

167
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>That sounds horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.690
<v Speaker 2>But there's another app called plantsnap</v>
<v Speaker 2>and apparently uses artificial </v>

169
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 2>like a reverse google image search to </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify a plant.</v>

171
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I've used that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's useless.</v>

172
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Anything you take a picture of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be able to identify </v>

173
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.801
<v Speaker 2>anything but this flower Checker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just live people on the other end </v>

174
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>does google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a google image search is like </v>

175
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

176
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 2>there's an application that use cameras </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you take a photo of something can</v>

177
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:13.061
<v Speaker 2>identify exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's called like a reverse </v>

178
00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>google image search or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

179
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ai doesn't seem to work as well </v>

180
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>for plant identification and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine it's looking at the leaves,</v>

181
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 2>the shape of the leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it comes up,</v>

182
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 2>the veins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite versus symmetrical and </v>

184
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>everything that goes into a plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification.</v>

185
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>But now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still rather go with a real person.</v>

186
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Still had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>You got to go with a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go with an actual botanist.</v>

188
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Steelhead are a ocean bound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rainbow trout,</v>

189
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come forth.</v>

190
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

191
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>do you guys do catch and release or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat them?</v>

192
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>This was all catch and release though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a common thing with those.</v>

193
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain kind that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch.</v>

194
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fly fishing expert.</v>

195
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:53.801
<v Speaker 2>This is like a fun trip with my kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to fly fish and we didn't </v>

196
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 2>catch any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could actually keep.</v>

197
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that kind</v>

198
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>of fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

199
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you know that take a long trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out into the wilderness,</v>

200
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>go to the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch fish,</v>

201
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.370
<v Speaker 1>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Seems it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thrill of the chase.</v>

203
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels great for kids.</v>

204
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it with kids,</v>

205
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 1>bass fishing before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a can't do that.</v>

206
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>When you bow hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

207
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no catch and release.</v>

208
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sticking a hook and a fish's </v>

209
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>mouth and then letting it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

210
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's let them go.</v>

211
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>They're hard to reel and less like a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute fight.</v>

212
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Efficient and they're big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>There's powerful fish to the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>currents.</v>

214
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Ocean fish are almost always more strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you pull them in a freshwater fish,</v>

215
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very strong.</v>

216
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 1>They're stronger than ants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

217
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiel back to the animals.</v>

218
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Go back to this amp thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell me what has been the reaction,</v>

219
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 1>like when you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you feel.</v>

220
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's more just like a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really did feel like you do.</v>

221
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 1>You do feel more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's because of the Ginseng</v>

222
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.700
<v Speaker 1>or is it possible to see both fact and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just live within the gen sing and </v>

223
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that makes the story sexier for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>website that sells.</v>

224
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So you think just eating the ants </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

225
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>give you an entry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that you'd have to catch</v>

226
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:09.921
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ants to get what you'd get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like all the powdered extract that </v>

227
00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:09.921
<v Speaker 1>they sell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

228
00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>But I mean eating the powdered extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>then just that somehow or another.</v>

229
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>What's the mechanism for giving you </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy?</v>

230
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some chemical that's in the ants</v>

231
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.920
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the mechanism of action </v>

232
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:23.920
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

233
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.301
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't claim to be an expert in </v>

234
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:26.301
<v Speaker 1>index extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet you got a bottle of tribe.</v>

235
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I have a bottle of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

236
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:29.720
<v Speaker 1>it was in with all my other supplements </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

237
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:34.721
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was packing up this morning and </v>

238
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.771
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is interesting to show to you just a </v>

239
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>giant bottle that says aunt on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

240
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>what's the standard way that people take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the cloud or as a tincture?</v>

241
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine you could probably put </v>

242
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>it in a smoothie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your bee pollen and other insect </v>

244
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 1>derivatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

245
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

246
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a weird one,</v>

247
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

249
00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you should've come out and done the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spartan.</v>

250
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

251
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I told you I couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said I should cook Spartan.</v>

252
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:10.161
<v Speaker 1>Spartan's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ends a little bit more interested in </v>

253
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 1>business in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to Disney for myself.</v>

254
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah they have.</v>

255
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:17.331
<v Speaker 1>They have kids you'd like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were doing commentary or </v>

256
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:17.331
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're doing?</v>

257
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:17.331
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

258
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>they have commentary all day long with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these spartan race.</v>

259
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing the commentary and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>raced the next day.</v>

260
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you did it one day competition one </v>

261
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a two day race thing.</v>

262
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do the way they do it,</v>

263
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they get like tens probably I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these races,</v>

264
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>eight to 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes that in that approximate range.</v>

265
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>So they break it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out,</v>

266
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 1>they break it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's long races,</v>

267
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>they're short races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the long race was 13,</v>

268
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 1>about 13 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which on the road half marathon,</v>

269
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 1>that'd be like a 105 that an athlete </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do on a,</v>

270
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.590
<v Speaker 1>on a race like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with the obstacles and the hills </v>

271
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a big bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a ski,</v>

272
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 1>which I just found out from my wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently used fake snow.</v>

273
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v Speaker 1>There's like a pond at the top of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the resort that they make </v>

274
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>all the snow with apparently snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's artificially created.</v>

275
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you make with the snow </v>

276
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:10.911
<v Speaker 1>machines artificially created real snow </v>
<v Speaker 1>made from water at the top of the </v>

277
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>mountain in the snow machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

278
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

279
00:12:12.891 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not foam.</v>

280
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if anybody's trying to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make foam snow.</v>

281
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it makes some snow.</v>

282
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Asked him at the mall in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got some,</v>

283
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>they've got something over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a snow machine.</v>

284
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:28.801
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably is actual Snow Dragon Mall </v>

285
00:12:28.801 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a crazy hill.</v>

286
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets,</v>

287
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an actual indoor skew.</v>

288
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.130
<v Speaker 1>They've penguins and indoor ski resort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

289
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this race though,</v>

290
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:41.461
<v Speaker 1>for those same 13 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two hours and I think the </v>

291
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>winter did a to 16 to 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

292
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to jump over a lot slower.</v>

293
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.190
<v Speaker 1>You gotta carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry sandbags and carry big gravel </v>

294
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.861
<v Speaker 1>buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like doing yard chores and then </v>

295
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 1>running to the next chore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbwire Crawling and Hoisting ropes.</v>

296
00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's good for full body fitness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I used to do triathlon when I </v>

297
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>did triathlon it was weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Because you swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bike,</v>

299
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:06.121
<v Speaker 1>you run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had an engine that could go for </v>

300
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:06.121
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did my first spartan race.</v>

301
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't climb a rope and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry sandbag up a hill.</v>

302
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's good for functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness.</v>

303
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tammy's.</v>

304
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Got a video out there that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stadium.</v>

305
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a good way to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of the stadium.</v>

306
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Dodger's stadium a couple of years and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

307
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get muddy and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no fake snow and the stadium races can </v>

308
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.250
<v Speaker 1>selfies.</v>

309
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it can be kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke because some people will go out and</v>

310
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>uniforms with big cowboy hats on and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

311
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 1>dressed up as spiderman in their Lycra </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some people they have these </v>

312
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>elite waves where it's actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>legit athletes doing this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting though.</v>

314
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.780
<v Speaker 1>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you can see you move your body in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different ways on these courses.</v>

316
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

317
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to train for it because you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to train all your different body parts </v>

318
00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and you train for power and strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's endurance.</v>

319
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:03.481
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good mix of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they're doing them in </v>

320
00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>stadiums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of cool.</v>

321
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>The stadium races are cool because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up at a t and t stadium,</v>

322
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:12.211
<v Speaker 1>we're running a race and you go up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and they will turn a stadium into </v>

323
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>like a three to four mile event.</v>

324
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how many times you go up and down</v>

325
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:20.611
<v Speaker 1>the stairs and they have an event for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids where the kids will go up and </v>

326
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>down the stairs and the kids have </v>
<v Speaker 1>miniature sandbags and miniature spears.</v>

327
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So it actually is kind of a cool then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty bad ass that looked family</v>

328
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.570
<v Speaker 1>except for his fucking selfie stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything must be documented.</v>

329
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You cannot live in this life without </v>
<v Speaker 1>people knowing exactly what you're doing</v>

330
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Running a selfie stick.</v>

331
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my kids to one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

332
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>those trained hunt competitions this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

333
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bonners ferry.</v>

334
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to do their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual kids and same thing,</v>

335
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>it's the kids' events where the kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>

336
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:52.441
<v Speaker 1>they've got 15 to 20 yard shots and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like a sandbag lift and a run </v>

337
00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and then they've got another shot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they've got burpees up and over </v>

338
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>cooler and another shot.</v>

339
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a grownup event and a kid's </v>

340
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.180
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are fun too.</v>

341
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are really interesting.</v>

342
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind them is kind of cool too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it lets people know what like if</v>

343
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:10.631
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're involved in one of those back </v>

344
00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:10.631
<v Speaker 1>country backpack hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

345
00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:15.240
<v Speaker 1>it's very much a physical event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much you're carrying most </v>

346
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 1>likely at least 35 to 45 pounds on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

347
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're carrying your camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your back and then you're hiking,</v>

348
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of feet of elevation.</v>

349
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>You're up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing over logs and shit.</v>

350
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:30.701
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying your bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of physical exertion </v>

351
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>involve like there will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of crawling,</v>

352
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot of crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you did that.</v>

354
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii hunt hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lanai Lanaya.</v>

355
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I hunted Kona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

356
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was like five weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the sheep hunt because the sheep </v>

357
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.801
<v Speaker 1>stale and the in the open plains you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawl sometimes for an hour and a half </v>

358
00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>to two to get close enough for a shot.</v>

359
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final day when I killed,</v>

360
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I killed two axis buck out there and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>final day we crawled for at least an </v>

361
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least an hour,</v>

362
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>like super fucking slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are switched on.</v>

363
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It's frustrating to with with an enema </v>
<v Speaker 1>or sheep.</v>

364
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Sheep are not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart.</v>

365
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as fast as an access,</v>

366
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's the most frustrating part is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you'll put on a crawl,</v>

367
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're 200 yards out and you spend</v>

368
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 1>an hour getting 60 and then the wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>swirls.</v>

369
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pick you up and they're off and </v>

370
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>that has to stand up and brush yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and you got to go crawl again.</v>

371
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

372
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.420
<v Speaker 1>if it was easy wouldn't hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>just be killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one of those jungle scrub cows.</v>

374
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I told you how you were telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

375
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:34.510
<v Speaker 1>So these to explain to people what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrub bull is because apparently they're</v>

376
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:34.710
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

377
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.730
<v Speaker 1>There's feral cows and bulls and cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot a cow and I thought at first that</v>

378
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it was going to be kind of a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunch and the cow because it,</v>

379
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

380
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.860
<v Speaker 1>the pigs are pigs that they eat really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because they feed on macadamia </v>

381
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.501
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a lot better than the pigs in </v>

382
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:53.501
<v Speaker 1>Texas and they taste amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're Damien.</v>

383
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:53.770
<v Speaker 1>We did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did it,</v>

384
00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was very fatty and it's like,</v>

385
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 1>like a nutty meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did a Cinco de Mayo cookoff,</v>

386
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 1>me and my kids and we took the ribs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

387
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 1>from this pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I shipped back so you know,</v>

388
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 1>it costs 150 bucks to ship 250 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat back from Kona.</v>

389
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>So had sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pig and cow and shipped it all back,</v>

390
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 1>which is not that expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pig was,</v>

391
00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

392
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 1>it ain't better than any pork I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in my life.</v>

393
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.250
<v Speaker 1>These ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we blended them up and my kids made </v>

394
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made an adobo sauce with the peppers and</v>

395
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.960
<v Speaker 1>they have a little food podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

396
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>we did all this for their food podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But oh my goodness.</v>

397
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fattiest but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a nutty,</v>

398
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>flavorful fat [inaudible] because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed on these macadamia nuts,</v>

399
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no grain,</v>

400
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no corn and they're just wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>and running around out there.</v>

401
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 1>So the pig was really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cow was tough.</v>

402
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

403
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on the first day we were out </v>

404
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.320
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the back strap and I soak that in</v>

405
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>lemon juice all day and in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke it down a little bit and it wasn't</v>

406
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:57.951
<v Speaker 1>that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I do when I got home was I've </v>

407
00:17:57.951 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>got a refrigerator in my garage and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked up a temperature controller to it</v>

408
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and get this temperature controller.</v>

409
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 1>It's called a four one nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 1>keep the temperature of the refrigerator</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 34 to 38 degrees.</v>

411
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So rather than plugging the </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator,</v>

412
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:09.200
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you plugged into this,</v>

413
00:18:09.201 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 1>this temp control unit and then you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>a humidifier in and a fan like on the,</v>

414
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom of the fridge and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take all your meat and you lay it out on</v>

415
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:21.951
<v Speaker 1>grates in the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I left it in there for about three </v>

416
00:18:21.951 --> 00:18:25.221
<v Speaker 1>weeks to scrub cow and it develops this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard gristly coating on the outside of,</v>

417
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the meat.</v>

418
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I took it out and just sliced </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this hard gristly part off of the</v>

419
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:38.061
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the inside of that meat was like </v>

420
00:18:38.061 --> 00:18:38.061
<v Speaker 1>butter to dry aging and essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

421
00:18:38.061 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dry age and refrigerator,</v>

422
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>but you control the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature,</v>

423
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:47.601
<v Speaker 1>you want about 34 to 38 degrees and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humidity can vary a lot more than </v>

424
00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

425
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>But I kept the humidity at about 60 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 degrees.</v>

426
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And then basically you just slice off </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that hard gristly external coding </v>

427
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and you've got this amazing super soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>super tender.</v>

428
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And then I just have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>this vacuum packer and it's a cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>little unit.</v>

430
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You can just cut a bag any size you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

431
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a neck or a shoulder,</v>

432
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 1>like a smaller bag for a backstrap or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenderloin and a bagged it up.</v>

433
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one of those vacuum sealer.</v>

434
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 1>So those things are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So the dry aging was key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

436
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk in coolers and they could set it to</v>

437
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 1>a certain temperature and they hang the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and dry aged out there.</v>

438
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.560
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know what walk in cooler </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have because I looked into the dry </v>

439
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 1>aging refrigerators and those are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000.</v>

440
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.550
<v Speaker 1>But you can get a refrigerator off </v>
<v Speaker 1>Craig's list that a four.</v>

441
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:38.551
<v Speaker 1>One thing I bought that was like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks I'll think is it on the </v>

442
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a normal size refrigerator.</v>

443
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And so and so the food is on grates </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the refrigerator.</v>

444
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So it took all the shelving out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator and I just put some plywood</v>

445
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on either side of the refrigerator and I</v>

446
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Speaker 1>put these metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

447
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you constructed your own sort of </v>

448
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.880
<v Speaker 1>exact and then just laid the meat down </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the grates and put the fan on the </v>

449
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.101
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's constantly circulating air </v>

450
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>inside the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the temperature controller has </v>

451
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

452
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll display.</v>

453
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So in my kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my house,</v>

454
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>it'll display the temperature and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humidity.</v>

455
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:14.811
<v Speaker 1>So I know if something goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not all that meat spoils inside the </v>

456
00:20:14.811 --> 00:20:14.811
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator.</v>

457
00:20:14.811 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'll see when I'm inside my </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen it'll read that,</v>

458
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that the temperature is getting too </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

459
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:23.121
<v Speaker 1>And the refrigerator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe somebody unplug the fridge or the </v>

460
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:23.121
<v Speaker 1>controller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 1>needed to be reset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happened a couple of times,</v>

462
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to keep an eye on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

463
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way though to take meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it far more flavorful.</v>

464
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.380
<v Speaker 1>More tender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.280
<v Speaker 1>especially that kind of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

466
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320
<v Speaker 1>that's tough anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

467
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Gamey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

468
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.280
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

469
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 1>water buffaloes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see the one behind me,</v>

470
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.250
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine shot one of those in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and he said that he had a </v>

471
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.000
<v Speaker 1>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a piece of it in his mouth and </v>

472
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.000
<v Speaker 1>who's chewing one piece for a half an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

473
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how tough it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was the backstrap,</v>

474
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.540
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the more tender parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body.</v>

475
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.800
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea of animals that's good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

476
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's good for your jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for your teeth structure.</v>

477
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Like there was this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's maximum mew.</v>

478
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>My brother sent me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this youtube video of this guy,</v>

479
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole idea is that that humans,</v>

480
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:14.071
<v Speaker 1>jaw structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bone density or teeth or trigeminal </v>

481
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:17.431
<v Speaker 1>nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that don't work as well as they </v>

482
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 1>should because we grow up on soft food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to chew food.</v>

483
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:23.270
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of boxers to like big chunks of </v>

484
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Bazooka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubblegum.</v>

485
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 1>It gets kind of hard after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

486
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Dig into it and develops muscular </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance or your jaw Mazda.</v>

487
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

488
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen machines rather where you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a leather strap in your mouth and </v>

489
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging a piece of weight from it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

490
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

491
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were selling those for awhile as </v>

492
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 1>a way to decrease rating of perceived </v>
<v Speaker 1>exertion during exercise,</v>

493
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 1>exercise mouthpieces and that.</v>

494
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.770
<v Speaker 1>The advertising on them was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vikings used to chew on leather before </v>

495
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>they go into battle to reduce pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase their time to exhaustion.</v>

496
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And so they actually sell these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpieces that you bite down on when </v>

497
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you're exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were designed to strengthen the</v>

498
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:07.651
<v Speaker 1>jaw as much as to reduce how hard you </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like you were working during </v>

499
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:10.591
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people swear by these </v>

500
00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:10.591
<v Speaker 1>exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpieces.</v>

501
00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the mouthpieces supposedly </v>

502
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>can maximize the amount of effort that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put forth.</v>

503
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference in the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of strength you tightened down.</v>

504
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like when you shake </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's hand and make a fist with one</v>

505
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>hand than you shake their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

506
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 1>you're stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

507
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that puzzles that.</v>

508
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Celine talks about his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

509
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 1>about how to generate as much force as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for as low as one fist.</v>

510
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're going to do like a </v>

511
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 1>bottoms up kettle bell press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

512
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.481
<v Speaker 1>you can do it with one hand open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>press and you close your hand and </v>

513
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>contract this fist and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far easier.</v>

514
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.780
<v Speaker 1>So what is the idea behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some highlights energizes your entire</v>

515
00:22:43.781 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Fascia,</v>

516
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

517
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

518
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Fascia covers,</v>

519
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 1>your entire body should be tightened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one part of it.</v>

520
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It causes you to be able to produce more</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

521
00:22:53.361 --> 00:22:58.361
<v Speaker 1>So let me try some time with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell or water bottle or a coffee </v>

522
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:01.621
<v Speaker 1>cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flex my hand outward when I'm doing </v>

523
00:23:01.621 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>like bottoms up kettle bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Flex your hand?</v>

524
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely flex my hand.</v>

525
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd never just like let it sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

526
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.120
<v Speaker 1>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always some tension.</v>

527
00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

528
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full body tension,</v>

529
00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:16.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the same reason that you'll see </v>

530
00:23:16.441 --> 00:23:18.121
<v Speaker 1>a lot of tennis players or I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers do this to a Valsalva maneuver </v>

531
00:23:18.121 --> 00:23:18.121
<v Speaker 1>when you strike.</v>

532
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So you hold your breath and go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand that same thing.</v>

533
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It tightens up everything and allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce more force.</v>

534
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

535
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the other gum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the bazooka,</v>

536
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a gum called mastic gum and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed this guy,</v>

537
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Dean Karnazes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who run the.</v>

538
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.450
<v Speaker 1>He did the 50 marathons in 50 days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

539
00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:39.160
<v Speaker 1>he ran the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional marathon in Greece,</v>

540
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently not 26 point two </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

541
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like 100 and some miles that he ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would chew this mastic gum,</v>

542
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>which they do use for jaw strengthen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you produce more saliva to </v>

543
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're running,</v>

544
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get dry mouth when you're </v>

545
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.010
<v Speaker 1>running and in a lot of times you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.650
<v Speaker 1>be thinking about food you want to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mastic gum apparently keeps your </v>

547
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 1>appetite satiated and allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce saliva.</v>

548
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And I bought some and it's to that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

549
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I think I got it on mastic gum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon of mastic gum.</v>

550
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

551
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Little rocks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing is,</v>

552
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.460
<v Speaker 1>is you can take it out after you're done</v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing it and then just like the next </v>

553
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.600
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it back in your mouth and keep </v>

554
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:22.600
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can chew that stuff for days.</v>

555
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an everlasting gobstopper tastes </v>

556
00:24:25.331 --> 00:24:26.450
<v Speaker 1>like it tastes like ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's not that good,</v>

557
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

558
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 1>there's this h pylori issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposedly very good for that.</v>

559
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look that one they added,</v>

560
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 1>they added licorice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>annecy and the fennel.</v>

561
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So it tastes even shittier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

562
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's supposedly,</v>

563
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we,</v>

564
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 1>we grow up on soft food and babies eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat soft food.</v>

565
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:49.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't want the capsule that </v>

566
00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:49.301
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>

567
00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:49.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean the capsule would be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

568
00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's where you got to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of companies sell it as a </v>

569
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 1>capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

570
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Is mastic gum as a capsule but gum that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you chew on,</v>

571
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the exact one I have that kronos </v>
<v Speaker 1>said there's nasty trumped.</v>

572
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

573
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:05.081
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the stuff that you actually </v>

574
00:25:05.081 --> 00:25:06.710
<v Speaker 1>choose to make your jaw stronger and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce extra saliva.</v>

575
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you use this stuff when you work </v>

576
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:12.820
<v Speaker 1>out or you just occasionally chewing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

577
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.441
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to have gum in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different things going on in so </v>

578
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 1>many different modalities of you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with.</v>

579
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:23.141
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can do is I try stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I write about it.</v>

580
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm doing mastic,</v>

581
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:30.281
<v Speaker 1>gum and black powder and injections all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day long and it works.</v>

582
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I would think you would keep doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

583
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like you forget about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff though.</v>

584
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You try out so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget about it.</v>

585
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

586
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I tried that out a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty good.</v>

587
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I need to order some more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

588
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you start to lose track of all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the stuff I try,</v>

589
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it all systematized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some big excel spreadsheet.</v>

590
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.060
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with the exomes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain that because I just got some </v>

591
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 1>shot into some tears that I have on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

592
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

593
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it's exosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exosomes.</v>

594
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.120
<v Speaker 1>They're signaling molecules so your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has them.</v>

595
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:07.121
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cells have exosomes and they're </v>

596
00:26:07.121 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 1>used as cell to cell communicators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they interact with cell surface </v>

597
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.971
<v Speaker 1>receptors and they'll actually carry a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message from one cell to another such </v>

598
00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:12.971
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:13.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to absorb this into the cell.</v>

601
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:21.131
<v Speaker 1>You need to carry this to a joint or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you'd want to use an exome for </v>

602
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 1>to carry messages throughout the body.</v>

603
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's part of your belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's referred to as the Para System,</v>

604
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your body's internal cellular </v>

605
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.691
<v Speaker 1>communication system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that if you combined the </v>

606
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:36.971
<v Speaker 1>exosomes with other therapies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let like a platelet rich plasma </v>

607
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:41.651
<v Speaker 1>injections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you'd do for it to increase the </v>

608
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:41.651
<v Speaker 1>amount of growth fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they did to a specific joint.</v>

609
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Did exosomes plus prp you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

610
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

611
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you the full procedure that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

612
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:52.401
<v Speaker 1>but I just got that all over my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My face five days ago was red and </v>

613
00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 1>swollen because it was covered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>exosomes prp injections.</v>

614
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's a beauty procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful as you are.</v>

615
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

616
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't need change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm a beautiful 13 year old and </v>

617
00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 1>a 37 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the uh,</v>

618
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 1>the exosomes can be combined with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like prp and also with stem cells</v>

619
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 1>or with bone marrow.</v>

620
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting thing is that you </v>

621
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 1>can get something like a placental cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

622
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually took placental cells from </v>

623
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 1>this lab called Kymera labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this procedure done in Park City,</v>

624
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to him,</v>

625
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Dr Harry Adelson and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had these placental cells from our </v>

626
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Speaker 1>labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They destroy the placental cell so that </v>

627
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.821
<v Speaker 1>there's no actual DNA from some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you're putting into your </v>

628
00:27:43.821 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

629
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the.</v>

630
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 1>That's considered to be part of the risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stem cells.</v>

631
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Even umbilical or amniotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still getting somebody else's DNA</v>

632
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your own DNA.</v>

633
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:59.210
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>exosomes that you've isolated from </v>

634
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.351
<v Speaker 1>something like a placental tissue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would mix those with your own </v>

635
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 1>stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

636
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:10.311
<v Speaker 1>what I used was a bone marrow aspirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went into to both of my iliac </v>

637
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:10.311
<v Speaker 1>crest.</v>

638
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.500
<v Speaker 1>They took out the bone marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mix it with the exosomes and and </v>

639
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:15.500
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these videos.</v>

640
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I published both of the videos on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and it's like a.</v>

641
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like a huge syringe full drawing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

642
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see the drawing on my hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much bone marrow.</v>

643
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>They're taken out of your head a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was while I was out,</v>

644
00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:32.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was heavily sedated during the entire </v>

645
00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:32.121
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will not heavily.</v>

646
00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I was under general anesthesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called full body sedation to </v>

647
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>general anesthesia with few of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>

648
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the actual anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not conscious.</v>

649
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Not though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

650
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:47.841
<v Speaker 1>all I remember is they said count from </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 down to zero and I got to like 93 </v>

651
00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 1>and then I woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

652
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:53.781
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took the bone marrow from the </v>

653
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:54.230
<v Speaker 1>ILIAC crest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

654
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Which is just like bone broth for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole body's got collagen.</v>

655
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Peptides got stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mix it with the exosomes which act </v>

656
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 1>as communicators from those placental </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

657
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 1>This place called [inaudible] labs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which my opinion is just a great sexy </v>

658
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>name for some kind of a mysterious lab </v>
<v Speaker 1>company where you buy placentas.</v>

659
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 1>So basically they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

660
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>they mixed the exosomes with the bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>marrow and then what they do.</v>

661
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's what,</v>

662
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 1>let's let your ass that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

663
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the early at crest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked me how much they took,</v>

664
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.440
<v Speaker 1>how much they're pulling out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

665
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Bone marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that like four times because he </v>

666
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>did it twice to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking shitting me?</v>

667
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:38.601
<v Speaker 1>This was five days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me I was supposed to not do </v>

668
00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 1>anything for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did the Spartan race.</v>

669
00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I armored myself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you listen to them?</v>

670
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

671
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:48.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was signed up for the race and I had </v>

672
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.971
<v Speaker 1>sponsor obligations to actually not do </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors to suck my Dick [inaudible].</v>

673
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a fat Dick there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use like four rolls of rocktape.</v>

674
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 1>My entire body was just taped up because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to ruin anything that he'd</v>

675
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

676
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.770
<v Speaker 1>How could he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

677
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by rocktape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is rock tape?</v>

678
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Kinesio tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen this stuff before.</v>

679
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like what you see crossfitters were</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendinitis supports.</v>

680
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It supports the joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

681
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 1>They're going in for another tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four of those,</v>

682
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 1>four of those big tubes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

683
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 1>to think you have in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you have four tubes of marrow </v>

684
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 1>floating around so I could pull out </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

685
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

686
00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the tubes also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

687
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>when you give blood you can give like 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>tubes of blood,</v>

688
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:34.621
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as much blood as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually looks like because it's inside </v>

689
00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:34.621
<v Speaker 1>of that little skinny tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

690
00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

691
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 1>So he and his partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like quite a lot.</v>

692
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.210
<v Speaker 1>What they did was he went with that bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>marrow to mixed with the exosomes.</v>

693
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:47.911
<v Speaker 1>They mix it with ozone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which apparently using an [inaudible] </v>

694
00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 1>which apparently increases the efficacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bone marrow.</v>

695
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing this for no specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>

696
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 1>no specific injury?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

697
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 1>This is all just for for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>

698
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:58.450
<v Speaker 1>anti aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

699
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.770
<v Speaker 1>just immersive journalism just to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

700
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I think this stuff's fun to write about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look into and study.</v>

701
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently the stem cell state of </v>

702
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>

703
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.671
<v Speaker 1>this is an over exaggeration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like you'd be like </v>

704
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:14.911
<v Speaker 1>wolverine or like you recover faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get hurt for the rest of your </v>

705
00:31:14.911 --> 00:31:17.530
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here he goes out round two for people</v>

706
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 1>who are listening to the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not watching the video.</v>

707
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like a horse pulling a horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

708
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 1>so it's a lot of blood.</v>

709
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he injected my entire </v>

710
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 1>musculoskeletal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did my cerebral spinal fluid.</v>

711
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 1>He did all up and down the discs in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

712
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you conscious here?</v>

713
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I've got needles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

714
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally out.</v>

715
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just box breathing.</v>

716
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was meditating.</v>

717
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally out for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] done.</v>

718
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You can see there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

719
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I have the ironman corporate logo on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

720
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.330
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

721
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm technically that's trademark </v>
<v Speaker 1>infringement.</v>

722
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.380
<v Speaker 1>The iron man logo I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm retaking done in my spine like that.</v>

723
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Bulging discs is awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so weird.</v>

724
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 1>They just just done a lot of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

725
00:32:04.501 --> 00:32:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my,</v>

726
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I told you this last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my stem cells taken out of the fat</v>

727
00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:11.290
<v Speaker 1>and my back down in Florida and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

728
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I re injected them intravenously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I tested my telomere length.</v>

729
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

730
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.170
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

731
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:23.250
<v Speaker 1>this goes on for our students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I was there for three or four </v>

732
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.311
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just screw it in and pop those </v>

733
00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 1>in and find a new hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're totally alcohol.</v>

734
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>But I'm totally a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife's in there freaking out.</v>

735
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>She can see her somewhere in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding the camera.</v>

736
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

737
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 1>she was doing a facebook live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answering questions as we went.</v>

738
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 1>So get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His partner comes in,</v>

739
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>she takes those exosomes after he does </v>
<v Speaker 1>ankles,</v>

740
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hips,</v>

741
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 1>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrists,</v>

742
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every part of my mother,</v>

743
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>they flipped me over by ice cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

744
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.490
<v Speaker 1>My wife said that was the weirdest part </v>
<v Speaker 1>was they flipped me over and I'm losing </v>

745
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:54.490
<v Speaker 1>limp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a noodle.</v>

746
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I think she's moving my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that.</v>

747
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

748
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.870
<v Speaker 1>then his partner came in and she's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sexual performance and beauty </v>

749
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:06.011
<v Speaker 1>specialist and I don't want this to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>into another podcast about just </v>

750
00:33:06.011 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 1>injecting things into your deck.</v>

751
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>But she did a hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she did,</v>

752
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

753
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:15.131
<v Speaker 1>she injected the Corpus Cavernosum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the shaft of your unit.</v>

754
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And then she did the head of the penis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she did my face over and over </v>

755
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

756
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:31.511
<v Speaker 1>Exosomes all over my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen some 50 and 60 year old </v>

757
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:37.211
<v Speaker 1>women who have done this and it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>does seem to have a pretty significant </v>

758
00:33:37.211 --> 00:33:37.211
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

759
00:33:37.211 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of an effect it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had on me,</v>

760
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:40.220
<v Speaker 1>but I said if they were going to put me </v>
<v Speaker 1>under just,</v>

761
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 1>he called it a full body stem cell make </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

762
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Apparently nobody's ever in the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

763
00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:47.260
<v Speaker 1>done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

764
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>if I die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing I can brag about </v>

765
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I don't understand.</v>

766
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't need this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

767
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

768
00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot of this stuff is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

769
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to write stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to talk about and tell people what </v>

770
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

771
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And then they did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

772
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 1>they did that on the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

773
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 1>where they do on your face here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

774
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:13.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the exosomes and mixed with PRP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that inject into the face?</v>

775
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Doing it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that thing?</v>

776
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember because I wasn't awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's got little </v>

777
00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.611
<v Speaker 1>needles all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be like some kind of </v>

778
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:24.611
<v Speaker 1>like dermabrasion type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

779
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Can your face up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

780
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was a few days ago and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many feel like a heel five days ago?</v>

781
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I healed up pretty quickly from CSI </v>

782
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.070
<v Speaker 1>because five was when I was doing my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head to where I'm a great minds think </v>

783
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 1>alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

784
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what day is it too bad?</v>

785
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Tuesday.</v>

786
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 1>So this was actually this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

787
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven days ago.</v>

788
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Seven days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine was Wednesday.</v>

789
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways though.</v>

790
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

791
00:34:54.721 --> 00:34:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had,</v>

792
00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I actually had just gotten a concussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got in a bike accident when I </v>

793
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 1>was down in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas a couple of weeks ago.</v>

794
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting because for a Tbi </v>

795
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do right?</v>

796
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:13.751
<v Speaker 1>Like ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exogenous ketones work really well for </v>

797
00:35:13.751 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 1>that and that's a lot of dominic </v>
<v Speaker 1>d'agostino is research on concussions.</v>

798
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.880
<v Speaker 1>A Dha is another good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy chambers with </v>

799
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.050
<v Speaker 1>the high oxygen plus the high pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really efficacious for </v>

800
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is stem cells.</v>

801
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did was I ordered the stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells that they harvested from my body </v>

802
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:37.301
<v Speaker 1>and Florida because I think I told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that the last time when I was on </v>

803
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>the show that they store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like 30</v>

804
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.720
<v Speaker 2>injections of my own stem cells stored </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in Florida that I can use for,</v>

805
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 2>for joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anti aging.</v>

806
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.530
<v Speaker 2>And I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons that I did that was </v>

807
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.530
<v Speaker 2>if I'm ever in a car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if forever get some,</v>

808
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 2>some traumatic injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

809
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I can heal myself faster with these stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

810
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 2>And in that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a concussion.</v>

811
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I was riding my bike and Austin on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on first street and in rush hour traffic</v>

812
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:02.270
<v Speaker 2>in a car clipped me on the side and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>made love to the pavement.</v>

813
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.480
<v Speaker 2>My entire face got torn open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

814
00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 2>and I got a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did all these things,</v>

815
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 2>have ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dha,</v>

816
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 2>hyperbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a PMF.</v>

817
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 2>That's also really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good for concussions.</v>

818
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

819
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

820
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

821
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a used for anti-inflammatory,</v>

822
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

823
00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:24.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

824
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 2>it's used for sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like grounding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthing.</v>

826
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of interesting studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>PMF also for concussion.</v>

827
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.450
<v Speaker 2>It enhances your own stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>

828
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It shuts down neuroinflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did that,</v>

829
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 2>but then also a stem cells won't cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood brain barrier.</v>

830
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 2>So I ordered up this stuff called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mannitol,</v>

831
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you inject mannitol into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream,</v>

832
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:47.760
<v Speaker 2>it increases your blood brain barrier </v>
<v Speaker 2>permeability.</v>

833
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.190
<v Speaker 2>So this is what you do in a fight or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>football player.</v>

834
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gets a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you inject with mannitol first,</v>

835
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.710
<v Speaker 2>and then you follow that up with a stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell injection.</v>

836
00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:57.690
<v Speaker 2>If the Mannitol is already in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream,</v>

837
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:03.020
<v Speaker 2>the stem cells cross the blood brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier and they go into he'll neural </v>

838
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.861
<v Speaker 2>tissue with the exosomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross the blood brain barrier because </v>

839
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:06.861
<v Speaker 2>they're smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small.</v>

840
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:11.570
<v Speaker 2>They're very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're like 100 to 200 </v>

841
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.480
<v Speaker 2>nanometers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty small and I would not be</v>

842
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 2>surprised if they cross the blood brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier as well.</v>

843
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.910
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about stem cells versus exosomes that </v>

844
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 2>stem cells tend to get pulled up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>

845
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't pass the lungs and they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbed there and they believe that the</v>

846
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:30.501
<v Speaker 2>exosomes being released by these stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells are the reason why you generate </v>

847
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:35.691
<v Speaker 2>regenerate tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that going straight to </v>

848
00:37:35.691 --> 00:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>exosomes is going to be more efficacious</v>
<v Speaker 2>than just going with stem cells.</v>

849
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:42.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think that some pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>company or some supplement company is </v>

850
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Speaker 2>going to make a lot of money in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years by figuring out a way to,</v>

851
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.470
<v Speaker 2>to make exosomes or figure out some way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it in a way that is more available</v>

852
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:52.940
<v Speaker 2>to the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

853
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:58.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harvesting it from placentas and you </v>

854
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.250
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy lab.</v>

855
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 2>So you weren't supposed to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>for two weeks now for two weeks.</v>

856
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>But I asked the doctor and I told them I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to do a spartan race.</v>

857
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.190
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proceed at your own risk,</v>

858
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 2>and in my plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently few jar the joints a lot when</v>

859
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 2>they're already kinda weak from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>

860
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you can risk tearing a ligament </v>
<v Speaker 2>spraining straining,</v>

861
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 2>doing damage to a muscle that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of weakened lax from the surgery,</v>

862
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:23.030
<v Speaker 2>from the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it a really a surgery because </v>

863
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.101
<v Speaker 2>they're not cutting the the injection </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I sprained my ankle within a few </v>

864
00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 2>hours after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after waking up from the surgery,</v>

865
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.840
<v Speaker 2>like I just kind of stumbled and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely lax and almost like a,</v>

866
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.530
<v Speaker 2>like a pregnant woman creates this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone called relaxin right?</v>

867
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And they get more flexible and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to give birth more quickly.</v>

868
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of that</v>

869
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.450
<v Speaker 1>same idea is the joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joints and the ligaments become more</v>

870
00:38:39.451 --> 00:38:44.451
<v Speaker 1>lax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my whole body felt a little bit more </v>

871
00:38:44.451 --> 00:38:44.451
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Gumby.</v>

872
00:38:44.451 --> 00:38:44.451
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I taped up everything.</v>

873
00:38:44.451 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had knee braces on an elbow braces and</v>

874
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:51.271
<v Speaker 1>wrist braces and I felt fine during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>race and this whole procedure was how </v>

875
00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 1>many hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about four hours.</v>

876
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Four hours out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold Shit Up.</v>

877
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>What does it feel like when you wake up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

878
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty funny video I posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny.</v>

879
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my wife,</v>

880
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a confession to make.</v>

881
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

882
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.240
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

883
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 1>speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she.</v>

884
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 1>And then she asked me if I speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

885
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't actually speak French and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see me trying to laugh,</v>

886
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 1>like it made a joke.</v>

887
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.850
<v Speaker 1>But you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been sedated?</v>

888
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

889
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:22.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.560
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of loopy make up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

891
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So I don't remember that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

892
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still,</v>

893
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest with you,</v>

894
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice much of a difference from</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this stuff.</v>

895
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 1>What's six weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

896
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.520
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to take a really long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it really kicks in and it flares </v>

897
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.251
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old injuries were like kind of strained </v>

898
00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 1>my upper hamstring when I played tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's flared up.</v>

899
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my left knee is flared up.</v>

900
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm feeling old injuries that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>most interesting.</v>

901
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 1>They almost like brought back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not flared up like it's red and inflamed</v>

902
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 1>and swollen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel it.</v>

903
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel my right ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I strained a lot when I was,</v>

904
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.280
<v Speaker 1>when I was playing tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one feels,</v>

905
00:39:56.281 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like I mentioned it's weak,</v>

906
00:39:57.961 --> 00:39:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it's paid.</v>

907
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be something they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it could flare up old injuries that</v>

908
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel worse before you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

909
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear that at all,</v>

910
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but I did hear that six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks is the benchmark.</v>

911
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of time before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually feel better.</v>

912
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 1>The other interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

914
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>for not only enhancing your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>endogenous stem cell production because </v>

915
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 1>it actually would know a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

916
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 1>It's fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's expensive.</v>

917
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

918
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 1>that procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like a $30,000</v>

919
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:32.641
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everybody's going to go out and do </v>

920
00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:32.641
<v Speaker 1>that and this is another fringe one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to.</v>

921
00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are ways that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>endogenously increase your own stem cell</v>

922
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

923
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 1>in your own stem cell viability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

924
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 1>without actually doing stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>injections,</v>

925
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm fasting is probably the the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most efficacious in a lot of </v>

926
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:50.551
<v Speaker 1>these things that are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable for you seem to increase </v>

927
00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:51.340
<v Speaker 1>your body's ability to be able to heal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or produce its own stem cells.</v>

928
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So fasting for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily fasting with,</v>

929
00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:01.140
<v Speaker 1>with caloric restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the mistake a lot of </v>

930
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.861
<v Speaker 1>people make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to fast and they feel like </v>

931
00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:04.861
<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is the benefits of fast and</v>

932
00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:06.550
<v Speaker 1>don't come from nodding a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>

933
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 1>not even a lot of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that great for your thyroid is not</v>

934
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:14.071
<v Speaker 1>great for your metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to live till you're 120 and be </v>

935
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 1>cold and thin and hungry the whole time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it'd be a horrible way to live a</v>

936
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea with,</v>

937
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

938
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:20.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

939
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.200
<v Speaker 1>valter Longo is research or a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

940
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.890
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

941
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.280
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting type of diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you fast and you increase cellular </v>

942
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.211
<v Speaker 1>autophagy and stem cell production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own stem cell production by going </v>

943
00:41:33.211 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>for long periods of time without eating</v>

944
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 2>and the magic seems to kick in and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 16 hour mark.</v>

945
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.220
<v Speaker 2>So I do 12 to 16 hours every day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get even more benefit once you </v>

946
00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:46.241
<v Speaker 2>get up to about 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I try to do a 24 hour fast from </v>

947
00:41:46.241 --> 00:41:49.631
<v Speaker 2>Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still eating the same number of </v>

948
00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a compressed feeding window.</v>

949
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

950
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.380
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like you're starving </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

951
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you're getting all the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting,</v>

952
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but you're still maintaining some amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of anabolic them,</v>

953
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're,</v>

954
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you're still eating as many calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

955
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you're almost giving your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gut in your metabolism a break in </v>

956
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>between a lot of these meals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the benefit comes from.</v>

957
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:11.390
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Bennett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits are not from,</v>

958
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not eating so much damn food.</v>

959
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 2>The benefits are going for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in between your feedings.</v>

960
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

961
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.980
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:42:19.981 --> 00:42:24.981
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd wake up and in the population for </v>

963
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 2>which this seems to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>deleterious,</v>

964
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 2>our lean active females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not respond well to these long </v>

965
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:34.331
<v Speaker 2>fasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a lot of time spent doing </v>

966
00:42:34.331 --> 00:42:35.891
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the cons outweigh the pro for </v>

967
00:42:35.891 --> 00:42:35.891
<v Speaker 2>that population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for,</v>

968
00:42:35.891 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 2>for most everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these 12 to 16 hour fast,</v>

969
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:43.961
<v Speaker 2>preferably up to 16 hours going without </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating and then eating as many calories </v>

970
00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.500
<v Speaker 2>as you'd normally eight with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception rest the,</v>

971
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.950
<v Speaker 2>the amount of calories and compressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding window.</v>

972
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

973
00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

974
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:56.051
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy whose house I was staying with </v>

975
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:56.051
<v Speaker 2>her when I was doing the stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>procedure,</v>

976
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Dan pump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very into this stuff and,</v>

977
00:42:56.281 --> 00:43:01.040
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a doctor down in a park city and he</v>

978
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:06.041
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes all day and then he has a huge </v>

979
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:06.041
<v Speaker 2>dinner at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

980
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:06.041
<v Speaker 2>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enormous lovely dinner,</v>

981
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:10.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of glasses of wine and you </v>

982
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:10.961
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay thousands,</v>

983
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 2>3000 calories for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm more of like a two meal,</v>

984
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>a light breakfast or light lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just two males,</v>

985
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing the 12 to 14 hour thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I have ramped it up to 16 </v>

986
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.890
<v Speaker 2>hours and I do feel better when I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I,</v>

987
00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I definitely become more accustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not eating for long stretches.</v>

988
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes when I wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning I almost think,</v>

989
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 2>should I just eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I'll stop and go,</v>

990
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really hungry.</v>

991
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>habit,</v>

992
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.550
<v Speaker 2>force of habit that I'm even considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating right now.</v>

993
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

994
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:43.241
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fasting is probably one of the </v>

995
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 2>better ways to increase your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>endogenous stem cell production.</v>

996
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Provided you're going for about 16 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>and provided you're still eating as many</v>

997
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 2>calories as you would normally eat.</v>

998
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 2>The only kind of caveat to that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein cycling.</v>

999
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 2>And this is why I'm not a huge fan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reverse diet.</v>

1000
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Were eating four to six pounds of meat a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1001
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

1002
00:43:58.731 --> 00:44:03.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're putting that on your social </v>

1003
00:44:03.731 --> 00:44:03.731
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of.</v>

1004
00:44:03.731 --> 00:44:07.721
<v Speaker 2>But yet I was eating one of those big </v>
<v Speaker 2>stakes every single night for dinner,</v>

1005
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 2>just like a bunch of steak every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>night for dinner,</v>

1006
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 2>for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was like 10 days.</v>

1007
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you feel doing that?</v>

1008
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I felt pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1009
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 2>but I love steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was eating these bone in a bone in rib</v>

1010
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ordered them up from a Missouri,</v>

1011
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I think is where their farms are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they make these,</v>

1012
00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:31.841
<v Speaker 2>a French cut grass fed grass finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>bone in Ribeye steaks in there saying </v>

1013
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 2>that I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've remind me,</v>

1014
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how I cook them.</v>

1015
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They will tell you how I cook them </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards after we finished the silence</v>

1016
00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:45.850
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't want to get because </v>

1017
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.771
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just forget everything if I start </v>

1018
00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:47.771
<v Speaker 2>talking about cooking because I love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare me.</v>

1019
00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:48.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so real quick.</v>

1020
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few people that are doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1021
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.250
<v Speaker 2>So real quick and then we'll talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to make these steaks tastes really </v>

1022
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.250
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1023
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that protein cycling,</v>

1024
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a meatless Monday or having as a </v>

1025
00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.671
<v Speaker 2>lot of religions would do like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Orthodoxy Church or the </v>

1026
00:45:04.671 --> 00:45:07.941
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have certain periods of time where </v>

1027
00:45:07.941 --> 00:45:10.731
<v Speaker 2>there's complete meet restriction or </v>
<v Speaker 2>your protein intake is restricted to </v>

1028
00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 2>fish and eggs for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that you would strike a </v>

1029
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.441
<v Speaker 2>sweet spot between not being in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly anabolic state.</v>

1030
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and not having,</v>

1031
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>having this mammalian target of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapamycin and constantly activated,</v>

1032
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:26.720
<v Speaker 2>which would theoretically accelerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>aging or,</v>

1033
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 2>or in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of rodent models.</v>

1034
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.640
<v Speaker 2>We see that on restricted protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding actually causes aging to </v>

1035
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.930
<v Speaker 2>accelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is on your lower activity </v>

1036
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:39.030
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for an athlete,</v>

1037
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you could still intermittent fast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get all the benefits of that and you </v>

1038
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.051
<v Speaker 2>could still eat as many calories as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would need to sustain a normal healthy </v>

1039
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:48.051
<v Speaker 2>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1040
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:49.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not starving yourself,</v>

1041
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but on the less active days you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift to a lower protein intake.</v>

1042
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about like zero point </v>

1043
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 2>five grams per pound of body weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than what a typical athlete would</v>

1044
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be depending on.</v>

1045
00:46:00.361 --> 00:46:05.361
<v Speaker 2>You asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was zero point seven to zero point </v>

1046
00:46:05.361 --> 00:46:05.361
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five grams per pound of body weight,</v>

1047
00:46:05.361 --> 00:46:05.361
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1048
00:46:05.361 --> 00:46:06.810
<v Speaker 2>so there's some days where you're high </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>

1049
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:12.110
<v Speaker 2>some days where you're low protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some periods of the week such as a </v>

1050
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 2>meatless Monday or some periods of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

1051
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:18.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as every quarter for a week where </v>

1052
00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a plant based diet or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're restricting me,</v>

1053
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:23.450
<v Speaker 2>you're basically giving your body a </v>
<v Speaker 2>break from being in that constant </v>

1054
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.450
<v Speaker 2>anabolic state.</v>

1055
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:27.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carnivore diet causes a lot of </v>

1056
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>people to miss out on some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>

1057
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.360
<v Speaker 2>And then if you look at the blood work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a um,</v>

1058
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 2>a doctor who does die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he published his blood work online and I</v>

1059
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:39.550
<v Speaker 2>don't know what else is going on with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from a health standpoint but,</v>

1060
00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:44.580
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had really high blood glucose and </v>

1061
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.601
<v Speaker 2>really low testosterone and some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that suggest that it might not be </v>

1062
00:46:47.601 --> 00:46:51.651
<v Speaker 2>healthy to just meet you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did you have really low </v>

1063
00:46:51.651 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 2>testosterone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1064
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It was like 200 to $300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really low.</v>

1065
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:59.110
<v Speaker 2>It's really low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diagnosable hypogonadism combined with </v>

1066
00:46:59.110 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1067
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like borderline diabetes did.</v>

1068
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to do it after a workout?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1069
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 2>he does a lot of rowing for real high </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure testosterone.</v>

1070
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:13.581
<v Speaker 2>That's significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would increase your HSC RP and your </v>

1071
00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:13.581
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory markers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1072
00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:17.511
<v Speaker 2>Which is why you never want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never want to go to a doctor for a </v>

1073
00:47:17.511 --> 00:47:20.361
<v Speaker 2>heart checkup after you've done a </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout because they're going to tell </v>

1074
00:47:20.361 --> 00:47:20.361
<v Speaker 2>you you're gonna have a heart attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the levels of HSC or p,</v>

1075
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blood work is just one example and </v>

1076
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:29.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to pretend like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One example is going to paint with a </v>

1077
00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>broad brush the entitlement carnivore</v>

1078
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 1>diet phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

1079
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that unrestricted protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>intake,</v>

1080
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:39.391
<v Speaker 1>an unrestricted meat intake probably has</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accelerated aging effect on the body </v>

1081
00:47:39.391 --> 00:47:43.561
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the different Dr Ron Rosedale is </v>

1082
00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:43.561
<v Speaker 1>a doc with some good information on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1083
00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 1>He's got a good video online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with this carnivore diet</v>

1084
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:50.821
<v Speaker 1>is there's no science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are giving </v>

1085
00:47:50.821 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 1>it a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people finding good results,</v>

1086
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but I find that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they just change things,</v>

1087
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:59.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a period of time with a say they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel great and that is absolutely 100 </v>

1088
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:04.351
<v Speaker 1>percent of placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as like a Vegan </v>

1089
00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel fantastic and named me,</v>

1090
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>name me one population,</v>

1091
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:11.701
<v Speaker 1>one blue zone that eats meat and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>else and there's.</v>

1092
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:17.371
<v Speaker 1>There's actually very few centenarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are purely Vegan for their entire </v>

1093
00:48:17.371 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>life because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do it the right way,</v>

1094
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 1>build up fatty acid deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amino acid deficits.</v>

1095
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Korea team is when you don't get vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

1096
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:28.620
<v Speaker 1>12 a Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's been studied.</v>

1097
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Corrine on Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1098
00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I been a lot of studies on vegans and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that if you eat a like e three </v>

1099
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.500
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you.</v>

1100
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can supplement it.</v>

1101
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of really smart vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those guys like rich roll,</v>

1102
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 1>like they do things the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1103
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to see the piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat to get some of the [inaudible] and </v>

1104
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:52.531
<v Speaker 1>some of the other amino acid you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to free up by soaking and </v>

1105
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 1>sprouting and fermenting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which my wife does a lot of it,</v>

1106
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.980
<v Speaker 1>but I watch her like she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in the kitchen like three hours a </v>

1107
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:02.401
<v Speaker 1>day making vegetables bioavailable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to take her hours to </v>

1108
00:49:02.401 --> 00:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>make sourdough bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

1109
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 1>to actually make a bread where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten is pre digested and it's actually</v>

1110
00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:07.490
<v Speaker 1>healthy in the glycaemic index is lower.</v>

1111
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:12.510
<v Speaker 1>She's not Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just a rancher girl and she likes </v>

1112
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.581
<v Speaker 1>to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have goats and chickens and we eat </v>

1113
00:49:14.581 --> 00:49:18.721
<v Speaker 1>meat but she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very into like an ancestral </v>

1114
00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:20.400
<v Speaker 1>preparation of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You deactivating a lot of these,</v>

1115
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:25.630
<v Speaker 1>these stress or is that Dr Steven gundry</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about and you know before we part </v>

1116
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 1>because we're talking about Tom Brady </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how he does like a no night shade,</v>

1117
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>no tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no potato,</v>

1118
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:35.330
<v Speaker 1>and I'd rather eat those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually figuring out a way to </v>

1119
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:36.850
<v Speaker 1>render them more digestible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendlier to the human body.</v>

1120
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing too,</v>

1121
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:41.470
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about food that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein in it,</v>

1122
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:42.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1123
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 1>like Broccoli has so much protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

1124
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 1>not really bioavailable to shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of Broccoli.</v>

1125
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't absorb it the same way</v>

1126
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grass Fed rib eye steak.</v>

1127
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:57.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Body absorbs that protein instantly </v>

1128
00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:57.361
<v Speaker 1>knows exactly what he does.</v>

1129
00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1130
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a study that just came out </v>

1131
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 1>about stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found that carnosine,</v>

1132
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.260
<v Speaker 1>which you find in copious amounts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed rib eye steak with blueberry </v>

1133
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.440
<v Speaker 1>extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced your stem cell production,</v>

1134
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:14.441
<v Speaker 1>and it was a hugely significant number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the exact percentage </v>

1135
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this combination of polyphenols and </v>

1136
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 1>flavanols with meat is a good combo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when I did the carnivore diet</v>

1137
00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carnivore diet,</v>

1138
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 1>that's when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was eating meat,</v>

1139
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I was doing lots of salads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing lots of.</v>

1140
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I had like wild blueberry powder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had these vegetable powders,</v>

1141
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:35.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a lot of big salads for </v>

1142
00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:35.051
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavanols,</v>

1143
00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:38.680
<v Speaker 1>polyphenols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that same thing with the high </v>

1144
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high saturated fat diet,</v>

1145
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:44.741
<v Speaker 1>like the whole coconut oil thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly inflammatory in the absence of </v>

1146
00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:49.511
<v Speaker 1>plant polyphenols and flavonols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why if you're doing a high fat </v>

1147
00:50:49.511 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 1>ketonic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be a plant rich,</v>

1148
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 1>high fat ketotic Diet.</v>

1149
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise things on those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a lot of your friends.</v>

1150
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1151
00:50:56.931 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about more like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing coconut oil,</v>

1152
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 1>butter and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avocado,</v>

1153
00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:03.360
<v Speaker 1>chocolate pudding and all these thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1154
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>your Keto genic fat bombs and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes that are out there,</v>

1155
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.110
<v Speaker 1>but he got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of plants.</v>

1156
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Even in the animal kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see animals and they rip up another </v>

1157
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:14.440
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a carnivorous animal.</v>

1158
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 1>They're in the intestines and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

1159
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the organs that are chock full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what grass plants or herbs,</v>

1160
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:24.671
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That omnivorous animal that the </v>

1161
00:51:24.671 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 1>carnivorous animal is eating predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

1162
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about carnivorous </v>

1163
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:32.861
<v Speaker 1>diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue that I have with it is </v>

1164
00:51:32.861 --> 00:51:35.501
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no research other than Dr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baker doing those tests on himself,</v>

1165
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:36.100
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1166
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Speaker 1>according to you are not very promising.</v>

1167
00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends that are trying it.</v>

1168
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 1>My friend Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his daughter had some serious anti,</v>

1169
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:51.070
<v Speaker 1>some serious immune system issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune disorders,</v>

1170
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 1>and like to the point where she's had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

1171
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I believe she's like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>31 set of hip replaced.</v>

1172
00:51:57.071 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 1>She's about to get one of her ankles </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>

1173
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 1>like serious arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real problems.</v>

1174
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:03.820
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's been able to clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up as meat,</v>

1175
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>just a pure meat diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with some people,</v>

1176
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:12.431
<v Speaker 1>but she might have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say the only pages allergic </v>

1177
00:52:12.431 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 1>reaction to plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there might be something.</v>

1178
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.150
<v Speaker 1>The meat wasn't the medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the elimination of whatever she</v>

1179
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:19.720
<v Speaker 1>was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might have some sort of a,</v>

1180
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real serious problem,</v>

1181
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.400
<v Speaker 1>some sort of allergic reaction to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants or to gluten and maybe a bunch of</v>

1182
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these diets are right.</v>

1183
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1184
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it's the elimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the magic of just eating me mean,</v>

1185
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:36.950
<v Speaker 1>but Sean Baker keeps going on and on </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how meat,</v>

1186
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>heels and meet this and meet that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivorous diet and you know,</v>

1187
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:45.221
<v Speaker 1>all these people trying it like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of good stuff going for </v>

1188
00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1189
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 1>but restriction of plant matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1190
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:53.351
<v Speaker 1>long term is not a good idea and eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat all the time long term is not </v>

1191
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:58.421
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eating only plants with the absence </v>

1192
00:52:58.421 --> 00:52:59.030
<v Speaker 1>of some meat based protein is for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of populations.</v>

1193
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Not that great of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:05.741
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the point is that for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you're going to have to </v>

1195
00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 1>experiment a little bit to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what works best for you.</v>

1196
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:12.401
<v Speaker 1>And there are people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you use e three live and </v>

1197
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:15.080
<v Speaker 1>algae and get your [inaudible] vitamins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your fat soluble vitamins,</v>

1198
00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 1>you can live off of Vegan Diet.</v>

1199
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really have to be careful about </v>

1200
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other people where they</v>

1201
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:25.361
<v Speaker 1>can't and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you really have to figure out what </v>

1202
00:53:25.361 --> 00:53:27.911
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is going on with the carnivore </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to me is kinda tweaking me out </v>

1203
00:53:27.911 --> 00:53:32.331
<v Speaker 1>because I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they start talking about the </v>

1204
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:38.180
<v Speaker 1>poisons and Fido toxins and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are in plants that are bad </v>

1205
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1206
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:43.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue with Dennis mild hormetic </v>

1207
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.670
<v Speaker 1>exercise is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunlight's bad for all that stuff </v>

1208
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to say for a medic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressor is that your body responds to </v>

1209
00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even show that some of the,</v>

1210
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 1>some of the rodents outside of Chernobyl</v>
<v Speaker 1>are living longer from the radiation.</v>

1211
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying like go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go move your cabinet next to a nuclear </v>

1212
00:53:59.810 --> 00:53:59.810
<v Speaker 1>disaster website.</v>

1213
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that's a hormetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressor.</v>

1214
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Mild amounts of UVA and UVB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1215
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Every day I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day I do cold.</v>

1216
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Every single day I do hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not in the sauna that I'm wearing</v>

1217
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>more clothes than I would normally wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to the gym to get my,</v>

1218
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.630
<v Speaker 1>get my heart rate up and actually get </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself into the discomfort of hot for </v>

1219
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the heat shock protein and the nitric </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxide.</v>

1220
00:54:19.171 --> 00:54:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that does for you in the discomfort </v>

1221
00:54:24.171 --> 00:54:26.211
<v Speaker 1>of cold because it's a hormetic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're doing tests right now at </v>

1222
00:54:26.211 --> 00:54:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's fast yoga and trying to figure </v>

1223
00:54:29.991 --> 00:54:32.901
<v Speaker 1>out if hot yoga has the same hermetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress response as I'm sauna because </v>

1224
00:54:32.901 --> 00:54:35.020
<v Speaker 1>they know there's been quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work done on.</v>

1225
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very equivalent physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't do the full choreographed</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 minute Bikram Yoga,</v>

1227
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.540
<v Speaker 1>but I have one of these big Saunas.</v>

1228
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a four person sauna and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go in there by myself,</v>

1229
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I can do in down dog and pushups and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>take these,</v>

1230
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:58.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cats who blood flow restriction </v>

1231
00:54:58.101 --> 00:54:58.101
<v Speaker 1>devices in there and do pushups and </v>
<v Speaker 1>squats.</v>

1232
00:54:58.101 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And those are the research behind those </v>
<v Speaker 1>for muscle maintenance.</v>

1233
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 1>With bodyweight training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very intriguing.</v>

1234
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I travel with them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

1235
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.850
<v Speaker 1>these cats who training devices and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just tie them like tourniquets on my </v>

1236
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:13.401
<v Speaker 1>arms around my legs and they do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies and seniors for muscle </v>

1237
00:55:13.401 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 1>maintenance without the need for as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>joint impact,</v>

1238
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is you get micro damage</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the capillaries,</v>

1239
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you get a big release of lactic acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>which causes you to produce more growth </v>

1240
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 1>hormone after the workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in my opinion,</v>

1241
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 1>for bodyweight training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at this point,</v>

1242
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Katsu training like doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that before.</v>

1244
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really gotten into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very big on the sauna to the </v>

1245
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 1>point where obviously we have one here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the studio that he used all the time.</v>

1246
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:45.260
<v Speaker 1>those stressors that they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as being a negative thing with </v>

1248
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 1>eating vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't buy it.</v>

1249
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I just don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been eating vegetables </v>

1250
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.361
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're bad access or in </v>

1251
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:55.640
<v Speaker 1>people like your friend with the immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>system issue or people with leaky gut or</v>

1252
00:55:55.771 --> 00:56:00.771
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a period of time where </v>

1253
00:56:00.771 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to be careful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really careful with gluten,</v>

1254
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a digestive stress or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1255
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:06.750
<v Speaker 1>even that in small amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably good for you.</v>

1256
00:56:06.751 --> 00:56:11.751
<v Speaker 1>They've been shown that kids who get </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten restricted when their kids wind </v>

1257
00:56:11.751 --> 00:56:15.531
<v Speaker 1>up having more issues with gluten later </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in life because their guts might be </v>

1258
00:56:15.531 --> 00:56:15.531
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>

1259
00:56:15.531 --> 00:56:15.531
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1260
00:56:15.531 --> 00:56:19.850
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectins and plant phytochemicals and a </v>

1261
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:20.760
<v Speaker 1>lot of things that plants use to poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals are two,</v>

1262
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 1>cause they're their seeds to be digested</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pass out through the digestive tract</v>

1263
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and the stool of the mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can grow elsewhere.</v>

1264
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that stuff really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1265
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:30.310
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1266
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you stronger.</v>

1267
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You ever had that coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kopi Luwak you ever had that stuff is </v>

1268
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:56:36.871 --> 00:56:37.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat,</v>

1270
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 1>the Lemur coffee and shits it out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they take the coffee and sell it at</v>

1271
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.030
<v Speaker 1>this outrageous rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually delicious.</v>

1272
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Ferments coffee man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very nice.</v>

1273
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 1>But your elephants do to black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>

1274
00:56:52.271 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 1>ivory caught your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

1275
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like support the ELA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about lemurs.</v>

1276
00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Lima.</v>

1277
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:04.411
<v Speaker 1>I think it's harvesting coffee beans </v>
<v Speaker 1>from elephant poop sounds far more </v>

1278
00:57:04.411 --> 00:57:04.411
<v Speaker 1>laborious than than harvesting.</v>

1279
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Shuttles are lemurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hose it down.</v>

1280
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang for your book is titled One little.</v>

1281
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like a needle in a haystack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1282
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:15.910
<v Speaker 1>If it's just a few coffee beans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial elephant shit,</v>

1283
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 1>get jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee.</v>

1284
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 1>The elephant elephants chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're digging through their shit,</v>

1285
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:24.510
<v Speaker 1>chasing you through the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus they probably shit like crazy.</v>

1286
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Just like a person doesn't eat coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give them some,</v>

1287
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:28.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lte and there it is.</v>

1288
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 1>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are coffee tourists.</v>

1289
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.180
<v Speaker 1>That's almost like a bunch of coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>beans with a few pieces of Turd thrown </v>

1290
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

1292
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Son was almost looot coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just feed them nothing but </v>

1293
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 1>coffee and they shared it out sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we should out corn and can't really</v>

1294
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:49.261
<v Speaker 1>digest it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fermentation process that </v>

1295
00:57:49.261 --> 00:57:50.800
<v Speaker 1>makes the bean tastes better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem with the carnivore diet is my</v>

1296
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.990
<v Speaker 1>same problem that I have with the Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet.</v>

1297
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're being scientific </v>

1298
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.421
<v Speaker 1>or objective about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I being dogmatic it's becomes an </v>

1299
00:58:00.421 --> 00:58:03.391
<v Speaker 1>ideology and the ideology is the meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>heels and meets this and meet that and </v>

1300
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 1>meet is the thing and like no meat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one part of a good diet,</v>

1301
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.490
<v Speaker 1>one part of a healthy diet and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people there's some people that</v>

1302
00:58:12.491 --> 00:58:17.491
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you aware of the lone star </v>

1303
00:58:17.491 --> 00:58:17.491
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about that.</v>

1304
00:58:17.491 --> 00:58:17.491
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about it?</v>

1305
00:58:17.491 --> 00:58:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about me down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allergies?</v>

1306
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:23.940
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lone Star tick is a tick that bites </v>

1307
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 1>people and gives them an allergy to red </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

1308
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible for Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1309
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's spreading.</v>

1310
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.640
<v Speaker 1>It's spreading across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1311
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:36.650
<v Speaker 1>all we have up in my land is a ticks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as long as you get them off within </v>

1312
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.991
<v Speaker 1>24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't allow them to produce the </v>

1313
00:58:39.991 --> 00:58:43.711
<v Speaker 1>saliva that would make them release </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hold on your skin and it's that </v>

1314
00:58:43.711 --> 00:58:47.080
<v Speaker 1>that produces yellow fever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the actual tick bite itself.</v>

1315
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 1>So you don't get a lot of lime up where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at,</v>

1316
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 1>but I've never heard of this loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slime as much more prevalent on the east</v>

1317
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's starting to make its way out here.</v>

1318
00:58:54.101 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 1>There have been some lyme cases out here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>

1319
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but this lone star tick is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1320
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem and it's giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1321
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>It's something called Alpha Gal Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha,</v>

1322
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.720
<v Speaker 1>short for Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gao Alpha,</v>

1323
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 1>less shadows that sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here it is,</v>

1324
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 1>it makes you allergic to hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha Alpha one,</v>

1325
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galactose.</v>

1326
00:59:18.461 --> 00:59:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Alpha Gals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most mammalian cell membranes.</v>

1327
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 1>The allergy doesn't extend to non </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammalian meat.</v>

1328
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Poultry and seafood are all fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>

1329
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1330
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 1>once you get this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1331
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:38.560
<v Speaker 1>you're allergic to this Alpha galactose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could eat eight and human meat </v>

1332
00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.140
<v Speaker 1>according to the article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not allergic to those pig.</v>

1333
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome a million doubt it.</v>

1334
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So could he ate meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to go to the jungle and </v>

1335
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 1>have what they call a bushmeat credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1336
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ribeye steaks.</v>

1337
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how to make these Ribeye steaks </v>

1338
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.461
<v Speaker 1>taste really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I do on on the rub is like a </v>

1339
01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>really core salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a salt called Colima salt,</v>

1340
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>super high in minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really kosher salt course.</v>

1341
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Now it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They harvested from the Mexican coast </v>

1342
01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:10.361
<v Speaker 1>and it tastes fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

1343
01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>What's a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only salts I travel with and Boz is </v>

1344
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Kalema salt and then this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a c o,</v>

1345
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>l I m a and Black Kona salt black Kona </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt from.</v>

1346
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>From China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Hawaii.</v>

1347
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use that when I cook some of the meat </v>

1348
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>from Hawaii just because it seems right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1349
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>He use salt from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From,</v>

1350
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the volcanoes in Hawaii.</v>

1351
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I rub a Cayenne black pepper salt </v>

1352
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and then to reduce the carcinogens that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conform when you cook me either time or </v>

1353
01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>rosemary or both or just rubbed thyme or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosemary Reduces carcinogens there.</v>

1354
01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1355
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>they reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reduced the formation of a,</v>

1356
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they call them polycyclic </v>
<v Speaker 1>aromatic hydrocarbons.</v>

1357
01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1358
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that form on the meat when you </v>

1359
01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>black in the meat because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a good crisp sphere on the inside of</v>

1360
01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's nice and crunchy on the outside.</v>

1361
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>She was strict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the unhealthy effects of doing </v>

1362
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get some kind of an urban there</v>

1363
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take out the.</v>

1364
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>You get to room temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put this rubbing,</v>

1365
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.500
<v Speaker 1>you take a cast iron skillet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll do it on the grill at all.</v>

1366
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a cast iron skillet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heat up the cast iron skillet in the</v>

1367
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>oven and then you take it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oven and you put it on the stove top.</v>

1368
01:01:16.191 --> 01:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You put the stove top on medium high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>either use an extra virgin olive oil.</v>

1369
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>A have used lard before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you use,</v>

1370
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>although what has a low flashpoint gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a good put no extra virgin.</v>

1371
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Olive oil has a bunch of antioxidants in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1372
01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually guernseys as higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to that.</v>

1373
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>He never burnt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never an issue.</v>

1374
01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't smoke,</v>

1375
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>but when they see or things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing they tell you is never </v>

1376
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>use olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1377
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I use extroversion all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of an olive oil clubs,</v>

1378
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's because I have really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>olive oil.</v>

1379
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>They shipped me three bottles of olive </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil every quarter from a different pool </v>

1380
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>that or find that out because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>really read don't cook things at high </v>

1381
01:01:55.221 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>heat with olive oil.</v>

1382
01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even extra virgin olive oil.</v>

1383
01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I can tell you is the shots,</v>

1384
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>how you're speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying hi.</v>

1385
01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>He said medium heat and this says medium</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat too,</v>

1386
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that's the difference is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high heat maybe,</v>

1387
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>but when you're searing I would assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is kind of.</v>

1388
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not on there for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1389
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>extra virgin olive oil into the pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heat up the olive oil and you put it on </v>

1390
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>for maybe two minutes Max on the cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron skillet.</v>

1391
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:29.031
<v Speaker 1>You heat up the olive oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you put the steak on and you do </v>

1392
01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>exactly for a perfect medium rare three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half minutes.</v>

1393
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>One side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half minutes.</v>

1394
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:37.251
<v Speaker 1>The other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you take it out on this is where </v>

1395
01:02:37.251 --> 01:02:37.251
<v Speaker 1>you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably about that thick.</v>

1396
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1397
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>we're on audio.</v>

1398
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>It's about an inch and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1399
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you asked me in the last </v>

1400
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>podcast how big my dick got after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>inject it with about that big,</v>

1401
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1402
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then you put it in to the oven,</v>

1403
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:59.781
<v Speaker 1>you take that entire cast iron skillet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the oven on Broil and you broil </v>

1404
01:02:59.781 --> 01:03:04.041
<v Speaker 1>it for one minute on one side and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn it over and you do one minute </v>

1405
01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:08.300
<v Speaker 1>on the other side and then you take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the oven and you finish it with </v>

1406
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:13.251
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning when you take it out of the </v>

1407
01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:14.901
<v Speaker 1>oven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just take the steak off the cast </v>

1408
01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:14.901
<v Speaker 1>iron skillets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shove it aside,</v>

1409
01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:14.901
<v Speaker 1>just put on a plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1410
01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And you take a pad of butter and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>infuse the butter,</v>

1411
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1412
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you can use like garlic infused butter </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just use a plain old grassfed </v>

1413
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:22.640
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>

1414
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You put a pat of butter on the skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you let the butter just get to the </v>

1415
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>point where it's melted a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not Super Brown.</v>

1416
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You put the stake back on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter,</v>

1417
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 1>put the burner back on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you finish it one minute each side.</v>

1418
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Let it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it rest.</v>

1419
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Three or four minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That technique is the best technique for</v>

1420
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>the most perfect steak you'll ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds very good.</v>

1421
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds very good.</v>

1422
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what I do is the reverse sear </v>

1423
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.630
<v Speaker 1>method with a pellet grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep it at about 250 degrees.</v>

1424
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You ever used a pellet grill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1425
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:55.391
<v Speaker 1>like about pellet grills is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting an appellate socially a similar </v>

1426
01:03:55.391 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1427
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially getting hardwood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's compressed.</v>

1428
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:00.830
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they cut hardwood,</v>

1429
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>like for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's table it would take the oak and </v>

1430
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.801
<v Speaker 1>the saw dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would compress into these small </v>

1431
01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>pellets and there's a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

1432
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers a,</v>

1433
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:12.090
<v Speaker 1>a good one.</v>

1434
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1435
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they make one for the good girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1436
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>They have good grills and they also make</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that you could use with an APP.</v>

1437
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>What I like about it is you can control </v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature completely with your </v>

1438
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.371
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called a timberline is </v>

1439
01:04:25.371 --> 01:04:25.371
<v Speaker 1>one of their new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1440
01:04:25.371 --> 01:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get these compressed pellets and </v>

1441
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>they go into a hopper and then there it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is right there.</v>

1442
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that one of the woodwind?</v>

1443
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>That's where a pellet stove look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up.</v>

1444
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So the pellets go into the hopper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then at the bottom there's a gear,</v>

1445
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:43.700
<v Speaker 1>like a worm drive that feeds the pellets</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that fire at the bottom,</v>

1446
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>comes from an element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the element and then there's a fan.</v>

1447
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:51.741
<v Speaker 1>So once it's lit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the element shuts off and then the fire </v>

1448
01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>is stoked by this fan and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature controlled.</v>

1449
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Like very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very precisely.</v>

1450
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I like about this trigger that I've</v>

1451
01:04:57.631 --> 01:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>seen is that it seals up like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1452
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like a yeti cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very insulated and fixed.</v>

1453
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's really good at retaining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect temperature.</v>

1454
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And again you can do it on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get it to 250 degrees.</v>

1455
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Then mostly what I'm cooking is wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1456
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>low fat content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to make sure you </v>

1457
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>don't dry it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took it at a low temperature.</v>

1458
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:22.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm cooking a 250 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it to an internal temperature of </v>

1459
01:05:22.891 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>120 the once it hits 120,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pull it out.</v>

1460
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to open up the grill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the test,</v>

1461
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>your internal temp wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a wireless wire wire,</v>

1462
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>wireless thermometer that's connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's outside the circle.</v>

1463
01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>We see it and that's like what my dry </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging has and it's also,</v>

1464
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it lets me know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a beep when it hits 1:20.</v>

1465
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>So I know I go and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I pull it out technical.</v>

1466
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Then I pull it out of there and I use </v>
<v Speaker 1>this cast iron skillet as well.</v>

1467
01:05:47.591 --> 01:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>But I cook with grass fed butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take the cast iron skillet,</v>

1468
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I put it probably same temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium,</v>

1469
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>high heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1470
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:57.490
<v Speaker 1>when I'm got the steak on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the grill itself,</v>

1471
01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm using sea salt and crushed black </v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper and garlic powder.</v>

1472
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what I usually use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No black end extra.</v>

1473
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1474
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

1475
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>So then I take it off of there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I use grass fed butter in a cast iron </v>

1476
01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:15.421
<v Speaker 1>skillet once it's heated up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sear it on both sides for about a </v>

1477
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>minute and a half and then I let it rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending if I'm an ambitious,</v>

1478
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:24.630
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll let it rest a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover it with aluminum foil and put it </v>

1479
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.361
<v Speaker 1>in a Yeti cooler and I'll let it sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Yeti cooler for about 10 minutes </v>

1480
01:06:27.361 --> 01:06:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and I pull it out and it is just too </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>

1481
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 1>After 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yeti cooler now to the Yeti Cooler,</v>

1482
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>the Yeti cooler maintains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature.</v>

1483
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The stakes we should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife just texted shopping stakes </v>

1484
01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>yoder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoder pellet grill in the band,</v>

1485
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.960
<v Speaker 1>a cast iron pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the reverse sear method.</v>

1486
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:48.961
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that I'm cooking it to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect internal temperature of 120 </v>

1487
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will raise both in the Yeti,</v>

1488
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the Yeti Cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also from the Siri on the outside,</v>

1489
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.130
<v Speaker 1>so once I get the cast iron pan heated </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to a medium high heat,</v>

1490
01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I throw that butter in there and I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>her the shit out of the outside for </v>

1491
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:02.310
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a minute and a half.</v>

1492
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Both sides wrap it in foil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in the Yeti Cooler for 10 </v>

1493
01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:10.741
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It maintains its temperature and it </v>

1494
01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:12.721
<v Speaker 1>continues slowly cooking so that it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>it somewhere around 1:35</v>

1495
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:14.620
<v Speaker 1>ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I like.</v>

1496
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I take that back very precise.</v>

1497
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:22.290
<v Speaker 1>This is even more precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the sound effects is like </v>

1498
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:22.290
<v Speaker 1>beep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beep,</v>

1499
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>beep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cooking steak.</v>

1500
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of these pellet grills </v>

1501
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>because you get this real smoky flavor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your food that comes from hardwood,</v>

1502
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's no chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They compressed the hardwood sawdust </v>

1503
01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:39.241
<v Speaker 1>just with natural sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The natural sugars in the sawdust and </v>

1504
01:07:39.241 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different companies.</v>

1505
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a green mountain grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes a good grill.</v>

1506
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I got to yoga at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like.</v>

1507
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trager is really good.</v>

1508
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Most of my friends are using triggers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they this temperature control </v>

1509
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>thing and the apps are so good to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to use it on your phone.</v>

1510
01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1512
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that you can use good.</v>

1513
01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.560
<v Speaker 1>You said it and you could just walk the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck away from it too and it's going to </v>

1514
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>smoke your meat at 250 degrees and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a good rich,</v>

1515
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that smoky flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Hickory or cherry,</v>

1516
01:08:06.701 --> 01:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you choose.</v>

1517
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm like this with a </v>

1518
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>steak because I still need to dip it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the same way that you dip a</v>

1519
01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>prime rib and horseradish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stone mustard.</v>

1520
01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I did my statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like the stone mustard with a </v>

1521
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:21.690
<v Speaker 2>little little texture to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>

1522
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's fricking the middle of the </v>

1523
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 2>day on a Tuesday and I'm hungry to </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] last night and had steak.</v>

1524
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it was good.</v>

1525
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating discussion about artificial </v>

1526
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 2>sweeteners there with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys who runs quest nutrition</v>

1527
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and was talking about Tom said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Tom,</v>

1528
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:47.021
<v Speaker 2>it was Ron Ron Pena and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was drinking diet coke and we </v>

1529
01:08:47.021 --> 01:08:51.491
<v Speaker 2>were talking about some of the studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there on assets will family </v>

1530
01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:54.911
<v Speaker 2>potassium and the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotoxicity or sucralose to cause </v>

1531
01:08:54.911 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1532
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome issues,</v>

1533
01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:01.850
<v Speaker 2>the death of bacteria in the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was explaining how the amount of </v>

1534
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.741
<v Speaker 2>artificial sweeteners using that study </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just like way far in excess of what </v>

1535
01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:10.391
<v Speaker 2>you get from a diet soda and that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they call the increase in response like,</v>

1536
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:16.390
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that spiking of the appetite that is </v>

1537
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.781
<v Speaker 2>attributed sometimes to the consumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>of artificial sweeteners only occurs in </v>

1538
01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't used to artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweetener consumption.</v>

1539
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 2>And once they've kind of gotten into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1540
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 2>like a diet coke habit that now this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>all Brendan is like 12 hours ago.</v>

1541
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started drinking diet coke and I do</v>

1542
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:35.360
<v Speaker 2>know they use artificial sweeteners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bars.</v>

1543
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that planet as well,</v>

1544
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but he said you could take a shower in </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet coke and you wouldn't get sticky </v>

1545
01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:45.840
<v Speaker 2>because there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a small amount of artifice.</v>

1546
01:09:45.841 --> 01:09:47.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dusting of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeteners.</v>

1547
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 2>So actually it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1548
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it's making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't delved into the research yet,</v>

1549
01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:57.431
<v Speaker 2>but it's at least made me think last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night about reconsidering my stance </v>

1550
01:09:57.431 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 2>because what I usually do is I just use </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stevia and like Pellegrino,</v>

1551
01:10:00.381 --> 01:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>like my refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just full of Pellegrino.</v>

1552
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.010
<v Speaker 2>You ever try z?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I do a lot.</v>

1553
01:10:04.011 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 2>I love to love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1554
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink the shit out of trouble the </v>

1555
01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:11.260
<v Speaker 2>other day because I'm so busy.</v>

1556
01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I was doing that spartan life feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcing and they're sponsored by a,</v>

1557
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.880
<v Speaker 2>a fit aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1558
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 2>And then they cut to camera and I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big oldZ via.</v>

1559
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>There were supposed to be pretending </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're drinking that night or whatever.</v>

1560
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 2>They'd take the TVA down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitted.</v>

1561
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1562
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a God proteolytic enzymes </v>

1563
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the main thing.</v>

1564
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I could be confusing that with kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>cliff.</v>

1565
01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the other kind of flies off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a bunch of those proteins </v>

1566
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.370
<v Speaker 2>which are great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They break down fibrinogen.</v>

1567
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>They're wonderful for recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These enzymes,</v>

1568
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how many of them they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have just like that.</v>

1569
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:46.961
<v Speaker 2>A blood orange kill cliff [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use it as a marinade for wild pork.</v>

1570
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Holy Baby Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like beer can chicken.</v>

1571
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things I wonder if </v>

1572
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1573
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>proteolytic enzymes.</v>

1574
01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons they work as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>break down fibrinogen and they're almost</v>

1575
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>like an enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1576
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:06.281
<v Speaker 2>That same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have no marinade and nothing and </v>

1577
01:11:06.281 --> 01:11:07.280
<v Speaker 2>all the tenderize me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your digestive enzymes,</v>

1578
01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on it.</v>

1579
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Gut Pack or whatever you have around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you break open the capsules and you </v>

1580
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.750
<v Speaker 2>sprinkle that on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The meat.</v>

1581
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1582
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:14.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1583
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free suggests j almost,</v>

1584
01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With lemon and lime fish.</v>

1585
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a phenomenal marinade for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cliff orange.</v>

1586
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill cliff is good too.</v>

1587
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so,</v>

1588
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 2>so delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're getting very little sugar.</v>

1589
01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1590
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just deliciousness.</v>

1591
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1592
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>but I go with Pellgrino.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pellgrino is less acidic and perrier and</v>

1593
01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot of sodium bicarbonate in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1594
01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you looked into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies on baking soda for Athletic </v>

1595
01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Performance and its ability to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to buffer lactic acid.</v>

1596
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a potent ergogenic aid,</v>

1597
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:54.621
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that it causes gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>distress when you take as much as they </v>

1598
01:11:54.621 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 2>use in a lot of these studies and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1599
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.270
<v Speaker 2>more and more what the studies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1600
01:11:57.271 --> 01:12:02.271
<v Speaker 2>your dosing right with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with small amounts of baking soda for </v>

1601
01:12:02.271 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>two to three hours leading into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>

1602
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:08.210
<v Speaker 2>So my philosophy is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Pellegrino has pretty high levels of </v>

1603
01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 2>sodium bicarbonate in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it does,</v>

1604
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 2>it's got more sodium bicarbonate in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and any of the other bottled waters like</v>

1605
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 2>twice as much as Gerald Steiner and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1606
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:19.101
<v Speaker 2>any of these other waters out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of dosing with a little bit of </v>

1607
01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.581
<v Speaker 2>a lactic acid buffer all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anytime I want to jump into a </v>

1608
01:12:22.581 --> 01:12:25.941
<v Speaker 2>workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to push myself a little bit </v>

1609
01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:25.941
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you notice a difference?</v>

1610
01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know zero Pellegrino studies on this,</v>

1611
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but do you notice a difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically between not feel amazing when</v>

1612
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I drink that stuff all day?</v>

1613
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I drink that and I drink this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1614
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:34.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1615
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:39.330
<v Speaker 2>it's hydrogen enriched water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a molecular hydrogen.</v>

1616
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this foundation called the molecular </v>

1617
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.971
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do studies on the antiinflammatory </v>

1618
01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:50.010
<v Speaker 2>and antioxidant potential of water that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a lot of hydrogen ions in it.</v>

1619
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's called hydrogen rich water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the cool part about that is that,</v>

1620
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:59.380
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only other thing I know of that can </v>

1621
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.581
<v Speaker 2>do this or green tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>polyphenols is they act as an anti </v>

1622
01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:06.110
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory post-exercise without </v>
<v Speaker 2>blunting the hormetic response,</v>

1623
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 2>that positive beneficial stressful </v>
<v Speaker 2>response where you're talking about with</v>

1624
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:12.180
<v Speaker 2>exercise and so you can have your cake </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat it too,</v>

1625
01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get your antioxidants,</v>

1626
01:13:13.381 --> 01:13:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you shut down inflammation and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't blunt.</v>

1627
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:20.750
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hormetic response to exercise would </v>

1628
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 2>be the proliferation of satellite cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the production of new Mitochondria,</v>

1629
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:26.990
<v Speaker 2>which why you shouldn't take a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C and Vitamin E and some of </v>

1630
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 2>these high antioxidant compounds.</v>

1631
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Post workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same reason.</v>

1632
01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:33.981
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do a cold bath postworkout</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that hydrogen rich water</v>

1633
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.540
<v Speaker 2>allows you to shut down inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with once again,</v>

1634
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:41.880
<v Speaker 2>why shouldn't you take a cold bath pulse</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout and is there a certain period of</v>

1635
01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 2>time where they think you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

1636
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's the period of time to adjust </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

1637
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I go two or three hours for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as some people say don't,</v>

1638
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:58.740
<v Speaker 2>don't jump into the cold bath 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>after an hour cryo chamber.</v>

1639
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:01.970
<v Speaker 2>According to Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wait two or three hours and I don't.</v>

1640
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Rhonda is basing that on research or </v>

1641
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:10.761
<v Speaker 2>if it's an extrapolation or or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wait a couple hours now that the </v>

1642
01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.840
<v Speaker 2>exception to that rule is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise any closer than three hours to </v>

1643
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:22.261
<v Speaker 2>bedtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it elevates body temperature to the </v>

1644
01:14:22.261 --> 01:14:22.261
<v Speaker 2>point where it affects your deep sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycles.</v>

1645
01:14:22.261 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1646
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 2>and one reason for that is because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>core temperature is elevated.</v>

1647
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do an evening workout and I do,</v>

1648
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard later afternoon,</v>

1649
01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:36.001
<v Speaker 2>early evening workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite often I will still take a cold </v>

1650
01:14:36.001 --> 01:14:36.001
<v Speaker 2>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a giant claw.</v>

1651
01:14:36.001 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I bought one of those endless pools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1652
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:42.541
<v Speaker 2>like those fitness pools that you swim </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and I keep it out in the forest </v>

1653
01:14:42.541 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 2>behind my house and it's just chock full</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cold water.</v>

1654
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jump in there.</v>

1655
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I love that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it decreases your core temperature </v>

1656
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 2>and allows you to sleep better later on </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do that after an evening workout.</v>

1657
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:57.040
<v Speaker 2>So even though it probably restricts the</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficacy of the workout a little bit,</v>

1658
01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:58.300
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:14:58.301 --> 01:15:03.190
<v Speaker 2>My reasoning is that I'm going to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>way better and the benefits I get from a</v>

1660
01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 2>good solid nights sleep outweigh any </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss of benefit from decreasing a little</v>

1661
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:11.290
<v Speaker 2>bit of that mitochondrial density and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite cell proliferation.</v>

1662
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 2>So when you're doing this late night </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout out how far,</v>

1663
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:17.280
<v Speaker 2>like how long before you sleep you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1664
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:22.290
<v Speaker 2>What research has shown is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal to finish a hard workout within </v>

1665
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.380
<v Speaker 2>three hours before bedtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to,</v>

1666
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to mess up your sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>

1667
01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:31.921
<v Speaker 2>but with your cold bath you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably mitigate some of you and I go </v>

1668
01:15:31.921 --> 01:15:36.121
<v Speaker 2>to bed pretty early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually go to bed about but usually </v>

1669
01:15:36.121 --> 01:15:36.121
<v Speaker 2>9:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>9:45</v>

1670
01:15:36.121 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>AM in bed reading and I'm asleep around </v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1671
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:38.200
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>

1672
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.660
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm not finishing up a workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>until like 7:30,</v>

1673
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 2>which is the case sometimes you not </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish work.</v>

1674
01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting into the workout until </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 6:45,</v>

1675
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes I'm working out closer to</v>

1676
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 2>bedtime three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that case I'll do the cold shower,</v>

1677
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.930
<v Speaker 2>did a podcast recently with Dr Matthew </v>
<v Speaker 2>Walker about sleep and it's kind of </v>

1678
01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 2>changed the way I feel about sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance of it and how much,</v>

1679
01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.050
<v Speaker 2>how much you need.</v>

1680
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you can just power through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get through with like three,</v>

1681
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:04.150
<v Speaker 2>four hours at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be fine.</v>

1682
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:05.560
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1683
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.190
<v Speaker 2>But it fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>

1684
01:16:07.191 --> 01:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>there's exceptions to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1685
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>some people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this I think is the d,</v>

1686
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:14.710
<v Speaker 2>c to gene that allows you to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>get by on a lot less sleep.</v>

1687
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Some members of the population has that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gene.</v>

1688
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:18.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1689
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Small moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But furthermore there's this guy named </v>

1690
01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Dr Luke Huddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick little hills is his name.</v>

1691
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I could have really messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know Dick Middle Hails.</v>

1692
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's um,</v>

1693
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.950
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this concept.</v>

1694
01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:37.270
<v Speaker 2>He works with a lot of these European </v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer teams and what he looks at is not</v>

1695
01:16:37.271 --> 01:16:42.271
<v Speaker 2>the seven to nine hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not how many hours of sleep per night </v>

1696
01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:44.791
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the number of sleep cycles right </v>

1697
01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:46.831
<v Speaker 2>from stage one to stage five sleep that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get throughout the course of the </v>

1698
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:47.740
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

1699
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Meaning you're supposed to get 31 to 35 </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep cycles over seven days.</v>

1700
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.960
<v Speaker 2>And so you might get three sleep cycles </v>
<v Speaker 2>one night and five sleep cycles and </v>

1701
01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.200
<v Speaker 2>other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also,</v>

1702
01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen research to back this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what he does with his </v>

1703
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:04.260
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1704
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 2>he counts a 20 to 30 minute power nap as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sleep cycle,</v>

1705
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:12.210
<v Speaker 2>so technically you could sleep four </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours night and then you could do a </v>

1706
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 2>eight hour sleep night on a Saturday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 20 minute nap on a Sunday and then you</v>

1707
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:19.590
<v Speaker 2>add up all your sleep cycles and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>use any self quantification device to if</v>

1708
01:17:19.591 --> 01:17:21.330
<v Speaker 2>you want to actually measure how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times you're.</v>

1709
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>You're cycling during the during a night</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sleep and you look at that instead of</v>

1710
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.430
<v Speaker 2>am I getting a consistent seven to nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours of sleep a night?</v>

1711
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Look at the total sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1712
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I literally just wrote an article about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this this morning on my website.</v>

1713
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You should listen to the podcast with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthew Walker because he's pretty in </v>

1714
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:41.471
<v Speaker 2>depth about what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's recommended and why and the risk </v>

1715
01:17:41.471 --> 01:17:45.341
<v Speaker 2>of Alzheimer's for people to get less </v>
<v Speaker 2>than five hours sleep a night and I'm </v>

1716
01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:48.320
<v Speaker 2>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are you getting every night?</v>

1717
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I am for 24 hour cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting about eight hours,</v>

1718
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:57.850
<v Speaker 2>which means like if I sleep seven hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a 20 to 45 minute nap and that </v>

1719
01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:03.341
<v Speaker 2>sounds perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big napper and my naps are very </v>

1720
01:18:03.341 --> 01:18:03.341
<v Speaker 2>elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1721
01:18:03.341 --> 01:18:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You work extremely hard.</v>

1722
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not,</v>

1723
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not working out as hard as some of </v>

1724
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>these pro athletes who are like 10 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sleep per night Friday,</v>

1725
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 2>but for the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1726
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:15.260
<v Speaker 2>these normatec boots that I lay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1727
01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:20.261
<v Speaker 2>these great aided compression boots that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of move the compression from the </v>

1728
01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:24.340
<v Speaker 2>ankle all the way up to the hips and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lay on this bio mat which is like laying</v>

1729
01:18:24.891 --> 01:18:25.880
<v Speaker 2>on a warm teddy bear.</v>

1730
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like this map that makes infrared </v>
<v Speaker 2>rays,</v>

1731
01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:30.200
<v Speaker 2>so it's just like an infrared radiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>matt,</v>

1732
01:18:30.201 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>almost like a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've got these,</v>

1733
01:18:32.691 --> 01:18:34.950
<v Speaker 2>these binaural binaural beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1734
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:40.020
<v Speaker 2>it's an artificial intelligence based </v>
<v Speaker 2>audio that confuses your brain and lulls</v>

1735
01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This total state of relaxation.</v>

1736
01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:49.481
<v Speaker 2>It's called Brain FM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I lay on my back and I've got the </v>

1737
01:18:49.481 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 2>boots on and I have the mat on and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice every.</v>

1738
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm sounding like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a princess now,</v>

1739
01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:59.740
<v Speaker 2>but I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an assistant who lives at my </v>

1740
01:18:59.740 --> 01:18:59.740
<v Speaker 2>house and she really helps out with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of stuff.</v>

1741
01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:04.121
<v Speaker 2>She does the banking and she helps out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with bringing stuff to the post office </v>

1742
01:19:04.121 --> 01:19:04.760
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just,</v>

1743
01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.710
<v Speaker 2>she's just there whenever I need her to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do stuff and you know,</v>

1744
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 2>she helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's back home with the kids right now,</v>

1745
01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:14.891
<v Speaker 2>so she just kind of like a live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistant and everyday about 1230 or </v>

1746
01:19:14.891 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes up to my bed,</v>

1747
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:22.660
<v Speaker 2>she lays out the biomass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she plugs it in and she pushed it on my </v>

1748
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:22.660
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

1749
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.630
<v Speaker 2>She lays out the NORMATEC boots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She pushed the pillow out with a sleep </v>

1750
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:28.871
<v Speaker 2>mask and the headphones and then I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go up there after lunch and I lay down </v>

1751
01:19:28.871 --> 01:19:29.540
<v Speaker 2>for about 45 minutes and I'm just dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world.</v>

1752
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:31.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty sweet setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1753
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a good setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1754
01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good person like that that you </v>

1755
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:38.820
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1756
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:38.820
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1757
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was sleep though is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1758
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:45.910
<v Speaker 2>if you nap and if you pay closer </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the number of sleep cycles </v>

1759
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:49.630
<v Speaker 2>that you get each week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more important than </v>

1760
01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:49.630
<v Speaker 2>getting like seven to nine hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1761
01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:50.810
<v Speaker 2>How would you know how many sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycles?</v>

1762
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:55.811
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're monitoring it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you usually have or is that what you're </v>

1763
01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:55.811
<v Speaker 2>monitoring with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:57.350
<v Speaker 2>he use when he's in the ring is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

1765
01:19:57.351 --> 01:20:02.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as accurate as a sleep lab </v>

1766
01:20:02.351 --> 01:20:02.351
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1767
01:20:02.351 --> 01:20:05.800
<v Speaker 2>it's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin rose tried to get me to wear one </v>

1768
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:05.800
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1769
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got another one that's smaller,</v>

1770
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1771
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>it seems very start the sentence like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1772
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:16.941
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a lot of necklaces and Blaine to </v>

1773
01:20:16.941 --> 01:20:16.941
<v Speaker 1>go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it works.</v>

1774
01:20:16.941 --> 01:20:21.291
<v Speaker 1>I found it in Finland like four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and I bought it and I really have </v>

1775
01:20:21.291 --> 01:20:23.620
<v Speaker 1>been using it ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does like my sleep temperature.</v>

1776
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1777
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:26.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the littler one.</v>

1778
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get more restorative whatever.</v>

1779
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:32.900
<v Speaker 1>The Mora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1781
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd have invested in the company </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they seem to be everywhere now </v>

1782
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 1>and and help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were there.</v>

1783
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I was at a Finland of biohacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference and there was this tiny </v>

1784
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.541
<v Speaker 1>little table with one guy at salon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little ring and all of a sudden </v>

1785
01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:47.541
<v Speaker 1>it's just like kind of diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those diamonds?</v>

1786
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that light?</v>

1787
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1788
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Are they trying to say it's bling bling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blitz diamond,</v>

1789
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>linking it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them bitches know,</v>

1790
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of cool because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up your body temperature during the</v>

1791
01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 1>night so a woman could use this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracker cycles.</v>

1792
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It will tell you your heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>

1793
01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:10.020
<v Speaker 1>which I used to measure every morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I wake up,</v>

1794
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:15.021
<v Speaker 1>I look at my parasympathetic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic nervous system score and </v>

1795
01:21:15.021 --> 01:21:18.070
<v Speaker 1>then I'd be able to tell if I should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard workout that day or each day.</v>

1796
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Well now the range is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It measures it all during the night like</v>

1797
01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>it does with the five minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements throughout the night while </v>

1798
01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm asleep so I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get a running average of my </v>

1799
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:28.101
<v Speaker 1>guitars on your smartphone or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it,</v>

1800
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it pairs that with like how hard I </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out the day before and my heart </v>

1801
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body temperature,</v>

1802
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:35.070
<v Speaker 1>and then it tells me here's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>readiness score.</v>

1803
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So if my readiness score is at like 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

1804
01:21:37.411 --> 01:21:39.120
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to go in the sauna and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>

1805
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if my writing or scores had 90,</v>

1806
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll do.</v>

1807
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll go out and do the obstacle course </v>
<v Speaker 1>at my house and swinging bells and,</v>

1808
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and beat up the body a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty useful because it ever </v>

1809
01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:49.880
<v Speaker 1>had 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>

1810
01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that mean?</v>

1811
01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:56.151
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be better if I took a </v>

1812
01:21:56.151 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 1>two hour nap on the mat with the boots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably get to 100.</v>

1813
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Those normatec boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they send them to me.</v>

1814
01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I sent it to my friend Cam Cameron </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanes,</v>

1815
01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs a lot of you.</v>

1816
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen for arm they haven't for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arms and the hips to be like a giant</v>

1817
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it do?</v>

1818
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if if you do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper body activity,</v>

1819
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you're a pitcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a swimmer.</v>

1820
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>box or someone who's doing a lot of </v>

1821
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 1>upper body activity that the arms would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be efficacious.</v>

1822
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Curtis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1823
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.220
<v Speaker 1>They look kind of silly and they're kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hard to get on by herself,</v>

1824
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:30.090
<v Speaker 1>so I would be one more thing for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant to have to help me with.</v>

1825
01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:31.070
<v Speaker 1>What is it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1826
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:36.380
<v Speaker 1>it's graded compression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's apparently a form of compression</v>

1827
01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:41.481
<v Speaker 1>that they've patented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike a lot of the other boots out </v>

1828
01:22:41.481 --> 01:22:42.540
<v Speaker 1>there to where it the first time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflates.</v>

1829
01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:47.541
<v Speaker 1>It measures the diameter of your limbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then bases every subsequent </v>

1830
01:22:47.541 --> 01:22:52.371
<v Speaker 1>compression to be customized to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>diameter or the girth of your limbs and </v>

1831
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>pump the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

1832
01:22:55.651 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're wearing the feet or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leggings from your ankles all the way up</v>

1833
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 1>to your hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a picture with him.</v>

1834
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It was that Loma Chenko and those one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those earlier pictures.</v>

1835
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was another one earlier than that.</v>

1836
01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your legs feel light as a </v>

1837
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>feather.</v>

1838
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>FGL used them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And so this compression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as it's doing the compressing it,</v>

1840
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>what is it doing to the legs by just </v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed?</v>

1841
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Just pumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pumping blood like up,</v>

1842
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:24.030
<v Speaker 1>up and away from all the extremities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1843
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and just moving it around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veterans at the idea?</v>

1844
01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's moving it back up to your heart.</v>

1845
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Just circulating blood throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1846
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like an additional heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a massage,</v>

1847
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:40.050
<v Speaker 1>like a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll know if it seems more hard is </v>

1848
01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:40.050
<v Speaker 1>not a pump then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like an additional.</v>

1849
01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:41.660
<v Speaker 1>The horseshoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyways though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1851
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:49.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work though and they're incredibly </v>

1852
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:49.170
<v Speaker 1>relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1853
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like someone's massaging you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do watch TV with.</v>

1854
01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Well you can kill two birds with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

1855
01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1856
01:23:55.571 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got the full meal deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy has,</v>

1857
01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he's got legs on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little bit it,</v>

1858
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:07.530
<v Speaker 1>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could get expensive to do that </v>

1859
01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:09.601
<v Speaker 1>because now you've got to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation units rather than just one </v>

1860
01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:09.601
<v Speaker 1>because you can't plug them all in at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

1861
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's a spendy setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the UFC featherweight </v>

1862
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>champion later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1863
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 1>if he's the UFC featherweight champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can,</v>

1864
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 1>he can afford the Cadillac of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow man suits.</v>

1865
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's at Honolulu.</v>

1866
01:24:21.521 --> 01:24:26.521
<v Speaker 1>Cryotherapy getting his freak on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of these crowd </v>

1867
01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:26.521
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1868
01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:28.680
<v Speaker 1>centers have noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got the walking cryotherapy,</v>

1869
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.840
<v Speaker 1>they've got the NORMATEC boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the vibration platform so </v>

1870
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.471
<v Speaker 1>you can lose weight while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there in the vibration </v>

1871
01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:37.471
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Learned a lot of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about those things?</v>

1873
01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultrasonic things,</v>

1874
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about what are those called?</v>

1875
01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Turbo Sonics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen those verified vibration </v>

1876
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>platform that they go through like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole cycle?</v>

1877
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in park city,</v>

1878
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I did one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Great Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go take a shit right after.</v>

1880
01:24:58.570 --> 01:24:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1881
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on that thing for like eight </v>

1882
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:04.740
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1883
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and I had a glorious dump afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have,</v>

1884
01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1885
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:12.940
<v Speaker 1>a mini trampoline at my house and I jump</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and down on that thing in the </v>

1886
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.460
<v Speaker 1>mornings and it gets everything moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.480
<v Speaker 1>That's like my one two combo for having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good dump in the mornings is </v>

1888
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.961
<v Speaker 1>there's this herbal blend called try </v>
<v Speaker 1>Phala t r I p h a l a and I put about a </v>

1889
01:25:24.281 --> 01:25:27.610
<v Speaker 1>half teaspoon of that into a competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>super bitter.</v>

1890
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:32.850
<v Speaker 1>So I put some Stevia in there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to sweeten it up a little bit </v>

1891
01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and I pour the hot water over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have that at night right before </v>

1892
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:39.371
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wake up in the morning and you </v>

1893
01:25:39.371 --> 01:25:39.460
<v Speaker 1>could use the vibration platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do the,</v>

1894
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:41.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tai Chee bouncing.</v>

1895
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing some people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1896
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:46.000
<v Speaker 1>We just kind of bounce up and down like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this script programming or you can,</v>

1897
01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you can jump on a trampoline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably skip rope too.</v>

1898
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two combo just gets things moving </v>

1899
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 1>amazingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple double espressos before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

1901
01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do.</v>

1902
01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I did a hot cup of coffee in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

1903
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't put anything in my coffee black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my.</v>

1904
01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>My Protocol</v>

1905
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 2>for staying lean your rod is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be 215 pounds and I had to shut </v>

1906
01:26:09.010 --> 01:26:13.091
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weight to get into iron man </v>
<v Speaker 2>triathlon so that an iron man triathlon </v>

1907
01:26:13.091 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>for about eight years and the way that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed lien for races.</v>

1908
01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:19.650
<v Speaker 2>You get up in the morning and have a cup</v>
<v Speaker 2>of coffee or green tea because both of </v>

1909
01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 2>those can help to mobilize fatty acids </v>
<v Speaker 2>from adipose tissue and you do this when</v>

1910
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you're in that fasted state that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1911
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:30.071
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wake up after a 12 to 16 hour </v>

1912
01:26:30.071 --> 01:26:30.380
<v Speaker 2>fast and you take the cup of coffee or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the green tea.</v>

1913
01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Then you go exercise or move a </v>
<v Speaker 2>robotically for whatever time you have </v>

1914
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:40.271
<v Speaker 2>available at 20 to 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have to be that long and the </v>

1915
01:26:40.271 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 2>reason that you do at aerobically is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you wake up in the morning,</v>

1916
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you already have a lot of cortisol in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your system,</v>

1917
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:44.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1918
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:49.330
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to just stress yourself </v>

1919
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:49.330
<v Speaker 2>out even more by doing a very hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>

1920
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:53.561
<v Speaker 2>I like to ease my way into the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a non stressful morning unless </v>

1921
01:26:53.561 --> 01:26:57.311
<v Speaker 2>I've got a very busy day and I know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get hard work at any </v>

1922
01:26:57.311 --> 01:27:00.731
<v Speaker 2>other time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say my hard workout for the later </v>

1923
01:27:00.731 --> 01:27:03.581
<v Speaker 2>afternoon or early evening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your body temp peaks and your grip </v>

1924
01:27:03.581 --> 01:27:07.331
<v Speaker 2>strength peaks and your postworkout </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction time or your post workout </v>

1925
01:27:07.331 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 2>protein synthesis peaks your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1926
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:13.930
<v Speaker 2>your reaction time peaks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your body is very equipped to do a </v>

1927
01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:16.010
<v Speaker 2>hard workout in the afternoon and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evening more than it is in the morning.</v>

1928
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you can really tell his Jujitsu,</v>

1929
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:22.220
<v Speaker 2>my Jujitsu training in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm way weaker.</v>

1930
01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Just don't feel the same in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon.</v>

1931
01:27:24.351 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 2>You have much more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1932
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:26.360
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1933
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1934
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:30.860
<v Speaker 2>the idea is also when you do a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout in the morning,</v>

1935
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:35.890
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of times postworkout </v>
<v Speaker 2>caloric compensation men and you just </v>

1936
01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:38.750
<v Speaker 2>want to eat everything in sight until </v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking lunch.</v>

1937
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just hungry.</v>

1938
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And part of this probably physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you empty your glycogen stores </v>

1939
01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:45.160
<v Speaker 2>more quickly and part of it probably is </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>

1940
01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I fucking punished it this morning.</v>

1941
01:27:46.491 --> 01:27:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1942
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.890
<v Speaker 2>deserve to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1943
01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.920
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a few extra slices of bread for </v>

1944
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:53.920
<v Speaker 2>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1945
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:53.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is I get up,</v>

1946
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.751
<v Speaker 2>I do the coffee and then I'll do the 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 45 minutes of easy movement and that </v>

1947
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:01.610
<v Speaker 2>might be the yoga in the sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be a walk in the sunshine.</v>

1948
01:28:01.611 --> 01:28:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'm getting my vitamin D and I'll do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like breath work,</v>

1949
01:28:04.081 --> 01:28:09.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'll breathe in through my nose </v>

1950
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:09.081
<v Speaker 2>and do breath hold.</v>

1951
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So I'm still kind of making my body </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1952
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:12.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not stressing it out with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of east centric muscle tissue damage.</v>

1953
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And then I finish up that whole session </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a cold shower.</v>

1954
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:21.850
<v Speaker 2>So I'm getting a lot of those benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of white adipose tissue to Brown fat </v>

1955
01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:23.120
<v Speaker 2>conversion in the absence of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

1956
01:28:23.121 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inflammation and calories keep the white</v>

1957
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:28.070
<v Speaker 2>fat from getting converted into Brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

1958
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:30.330
<v Speaker 2>which is what you want when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cold shower,</v>

1959
01:28:30.331 --> 01:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>a cold soak or some kind of cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermogenesis and I'm able to stay super</v>

1960
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:38.460
<v Speaker 2>lean with that protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get up caffeine aerobics exercise in</v>

1961
01:28:38.461 --> 01:28:43.461
<v Speaker 2>a fasted state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you finish up with a cold and I mean </v>

1962
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:46.541
<v Speaker 2>even if you weren't working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stay pretty lean with that type </v>

1963
01:28:46.541 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 2>of protocol and this is what you did </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically to try to lose weight to go</v>

1964
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 2>from when you were buying originally to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just shed muscle.</v>

1965
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:57.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I would do really long </v>
<v Speaker 2>catabolic chronic cardio endurance </v>

1966
01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:57.250
<v Speaker 2>workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are not that great for you.</v>

1967
01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was just let you know,</v>

1968
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try a low rise.</v>

1969
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1970
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.990
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 2>So when you were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1972
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you calorie restricting as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like take these.</v>

1973
01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's calorie restricting or you'd go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bed at night and he'd be staring at </v>

1974
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>the ceiling hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's,</v>

1975
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to lose weight,</v>

1976
01:29:14.131 --> 01:29:15.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your body start to weight ratio.</v>

1977
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Your body starts eating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for these,</v>

1978
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:24.260
<v Speaker 2>for these fasts and workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are going to have facet hard </v>

1979
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 2>workout in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stay.</v>

1980
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>You can stay anabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but relatively non insulinogenic without</v>

1981
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 2>spiking your blood glucose too heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>with something like amino acids,</v>

1982
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a lot of people will do a </v>

1983
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>branch chain amino acid or an essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>amino acid.</v>

1984
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>You elevate your blood levels of amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>

1985
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:43.710
<v Speaker 2>keeps you anabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it allows you to stave off central </v>

1986
01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:46.551
<v Speaker 2>nervous system fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps you from shedding too much muscle </v>

1987
01:29:46.551 --> 01:29:49.610
<v Speaker 2>and you just spike your blood levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>amino acids and then go into your </v>

1988
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.400
<v Speaker 2>workout and you could even throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like ketones into the mix too.</v>

1989
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's like a very hypo caloric way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get a pre workout in without actually</v>

1990
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.240
<v Speaker 2>getting a lot of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>

1991
01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking before the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>about we were talking about different </v>

1992
01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.500
<v Speaker 2>athletes and diets and things on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines and you were saying that you don't</v>

1993
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:08.160
<v Speaker 2>think it's good idea for a pro athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly like a basketball player to</v>

1994
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:10.550
<v Speaker 2>be on a Ketogenic ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1995
01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that a strict ketogenic </v>

1996
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:18.441
<v Speaker 2>diet is a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is cyclic ketogenic diet </v>

1997
01:30:18.441 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 2>would be the way to go for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1998
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zack bitter.</v>

1999
01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:25.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what I do is I'll eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost zero carbohydrates the entire </v>

2000
01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:26.940
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plants,</v>

2001
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:31.970
<v Speaker 2>starches and fats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you about my morning </v>

2002
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:32.490
<v Speaker 2>smoothie you the last time I was on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2003
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:37.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coconut milk and bone broth and </v>

2004
01:30:37.491 --> 01:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>these precursors to nad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another very,</v>

2005
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That probably next to stem cells is one </v>

2006
01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>of the most potent anti aging protocols </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can engage in.</v>

2007
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Nad stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide </v>

2008
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:52.220
<v Speaker 2>is what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you about that in a </v>

2009
01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:52.220
<v Speaker 2>second after I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2010
01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll just briefly tell you about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cyclical ketogenic diet.</v>

2011
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all plants,</v>

2012
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:59.691
<v Speaker 2>all fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no carbs or very low carbs the entire </v>

2013
01:30:59.691 --> 01:30:59.691
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the evening,</v>

2014
01:30:59.691 --> 01:31:04.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the beauty of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario I talked about earlier fits in </v>

2015
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 2>because you've done your your hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon or early evening workout,</v>

2016
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 2>so your glute four transporters are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>upregulated.</v>

2017
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:14.300
<v Speaker 2>You're very insulin sensitive in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates that you do eat are far </v>

2018
01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.231
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be shuttled into muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>or liver glycogen rather than hanging </v>

2019
01:31:18.231 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 2>around the bloodstream causing </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

2020
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:23.160
<v Speaker 2>or rather than being shuttled to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liver and converted into triglycerides,</v>

2021
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 2>you're basically using the carbohydrates</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do eat at the end of the day to</v>

2022
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>sock away energy for the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2023
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Glycolytic demanding workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2024
01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:37.431
<v Speaker 2>And so basically you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're teaching your body how to be a </v>

2025
01:31:37.431 --> 01:31:40.251
<v Speaker 2>fat burning machine all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're restricting any amount of </v>

2026
01:31:40.251 --> 01:31:43.491
<v Speaker 2>glycemic variability all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming you're not doing the </v>

2027
01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 2>carnivorous diet because high amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

2028
01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.890
<v Speaker 2>it's gluconeogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can spike blood glucose,</v>

2029
01:31:46.891 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 2>but you're essentially doing lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

2030
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:53.130
<v Speaker 2>modern amount of fats and some amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein but,</v>

2031
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.110
<v Speaker 2>but not a crazy amount of protein all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day long.</v>

2032
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.580
<v Speaker 2>And then with dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2033
01:31:56.581 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>we'll do just to make sourdough bread </v>
<v Speaker 2>and while the sweet potato fries and my,</v>

2034
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids will make rice cakes,</v>

2035
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dark chocolate,</v>

2036
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:08.670
<v Speaker 1>red wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff is all in the </v>

2037
01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:08.670
<v Speaker 1>evenings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that refills your glycogen stores for</v>

2038
01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>anything explosive and demanding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just rinse,</v>

2039
01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 1>wash and repeat the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a cyclic ketogenic diet.</v>

2040
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Now this is cyclic one individual 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour session,</v>

2041
01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:22.580
<v Speaker 1>but are you experiencing states of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis during the day?</v>

2042
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2043
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2044
01:32:24.351 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 1>so I have a device called a level in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

2045
01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 1>L E v e l and it's a breath ketone </v>
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

2046
01:32:29.261 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just quicker and more convenient </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a blood stick.</v>

2047
01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's also long term it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2048
01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a good proxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good approximation.</v>

2049
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Lev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lev l there's another one called the </v>

2050
01:32:41.730 --> 01:32:42.650
<v Speaker 1>ketone x and you can get just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 1>a ketone monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blood ketone monitor.</v>

2052
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if people don't want to do a blood </v>

2053
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:51.210
<v Speaker 1>prick everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I type,</v>

2054
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:55.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the band aids on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers when I'm trying to write things </v>

2055
01:32:55.231 --> 01:32:55.231
<v Speaker 1>on my lap.</v>

2056
01:32:55.231 --> 01:32:58.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for me to just breathe into </v>

2057
01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.571
<v Speaker 1>a tube when I walk into my office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm easily that's exact track and </v>

2058
01:33:00.571 --> 01:33:04.771
<v Speaker 1>adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird how this has become such a </v>

2059
01:33:04.771 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 1>massive part of culture these days is </v>
<v Speaker 1>measuring your ketones.</v>

2060
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly hear people talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and it's so fatty fad now,</v>

2061
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2062
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny that he,</v>

2063
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:17.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2064
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said it and I had to explain what</v>

2065
01:33:19.301 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I was saying because it sounded weird to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me anyways though.</v>

2066
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:23.620
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2067
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.800
<v Speaker 1>the cyclic ketogenic diet allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be back in the state of Ketosis by that </v>

2068
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:33.601
<v Speaker 1>morning easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just basically maintained </v>

2069
01:33:33.601 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 1>that all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you refuel and carbohydrates at the</v>

2070
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2071
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and then there was another question that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked about nad that's something </v>

2072
01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:45.061
<v Speaker 1>completely different but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the cyclical ketogenic diet </v>

2073
01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:45.061
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

2074
01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So your body having those carbohydrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>at night knocks you out of Ketosis,</v>

2075
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 1>right when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating the bread and your </v>

2076
01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:57.841
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose will rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be shuttling a lot </v>

2077
01:33:57.841 --> 01:34:00.641
<v Speaker 1>of Acetol Coa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the precursor to ketones and </v>

2078
01:34:00.641 --> 01:34:01.670
<v Speaker 1>ketone generation and then you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a 16 hour fasting,</v>

2079
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but then you have a 12 to 16 hour fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

2080
01:34:03.381 --> 01:34:08.381
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the fasted morning aerobic </v>

2081
01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:08.381
<v Speaker 1>workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cold shower,</v>

2082
01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of coffee or green tea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect scenario.</v>

2083
01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:11.820
<v Speaker 1>PTOSIS works perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

2084
01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start your day off like that and </v>

2085
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.931
<v Speaker 1>then you end your day with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates as a hard afternoon </v>

2086
01:34:18.931 --> 01:34:21.721
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That easy morning workout and it like </v>

2087
01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:21.721
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for metabolism,</v>

2088
01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:22.660
<v Speaker 1>for body composition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2089
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:24.430
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for maintaining fitness,</v>

2090
01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:28.840
<v Speaker 1>for teaching yourself how to be a fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning machine will still refilling the</v>

2091
01:34:28.841 --> 01:34:31.480
<v Speaker 1>body of carbohydrates stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful scenario.</v>

2092
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's some,</v>

2093
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 1>there's some benefit in enjoying what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat to not constantly worrying about</v>

2094
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 1>your glucose levels and ketones and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2095
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2096
01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with having a little bread or a pasta or</v>

2097
01:34:45.881 --> 01:34:48.630
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it and that,</v>

2098
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also my beef with,</v>

2099
01:34:50.291 --> 01:34:52.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the carnivore diet is,</v>

2100
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like sweet potato fries and I like,</v>

2101
01:34:55.841 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like cauliflower</v>

2102
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:00.000
<v Speaker 2>rice and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:35:00.001 --> 01:35:01.760
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different plants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>

2104
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2105
01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:08.140
<v Speaker 2>this nad you can get these injections or</v>
<v Speaker 2>ivs now and it is something that </v>

2106
01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 2>enhances your own stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>proliferation,</v>

2107
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:16.690
<v Speaker 2>but it is one of the most potent anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>aging molecules you can put into your </v>

2108
01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 2>body in terms of decreasing the rate at </v>
<v Speaker 2>which your telomeres shorten.</v>

2109
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So you've probably heard a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

2110
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 2>two enriched foods like blueberries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cacao and chocolate and resveratrol and </v>

2111
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the most powerful of any of these as</v>

2112
01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:34.691
<v Speaker 2>nad nad to Nadh ratio is highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflective of your telomere health.</v>

2113
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 2>And these are the most horribly painful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uncomfortable injections or ivs you </v>

2114
01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:44.420
<v Speaker 2>would ever get in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

2115
01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you can do it orally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

2116
01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:48.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's companies like elise,</v>

2117
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.960
<v Speaker 2>a nitrogen that sell nr.</v>

2118
01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotinamide,</v>

2119
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.450
<v Speaker 2>nicotinamide riboside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a precursor to Nad,</v>

2120
01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't hold a candle to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainlining it into your bloodstream.</v>

2121
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:02.060
<v Speaker 2>And how do you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do.</v>

2122
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:04.520
<v Speaker 2>So one way to do it is in a medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinic,</v>

2123
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 2>you can get a six to eight hour ivy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing a laptop and you work away.</v>

2124
01:36:07.941 --> 01:36:09.410
<v Speaker 2>And some people do this on a monthly </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>

2125
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:12.910
<v Speaker 2>just six to eight hours of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long drip.</v>

2126
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2127
01:36:14.370 --> 01:36:17.660
<v Speaker 2>they have some of the guys down at on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2128
01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:22.661
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll have a nurse come in and </v>

2129
01:36:22.661 --> 01:36:22.661
<v Speaker 2>push a little bit more quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like an hour long.</v>

2130
01:36:22.661 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivy has it.</v>

2131
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Just do it short like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way more uncomfortable.</v>

2132
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:32.550
<v Speaker 2>The shore you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more uncomfortable it gets because </v>

2133
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.550
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing this stuff into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream more quickly.</v>

2134
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:34.280
<v Speaker 2>And it feels like your whole body is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

2135
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to box breath and close your </v>

2136
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.310
<v Speaker 2>eyes and meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painful.</v>

2137
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you ever done dmt DMT,</v>

2138
01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:47.450
<v Speaker 2>but you're on fire and getting punched </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gut at the same time and you feel</v>

2139
01:36:47.451 --> 01:36:52.451
<v Speaker 2>like your heart's going to explode and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you finish and you feel like </v>

2140
01:36:52.451 --> 01:36:55.841
<v Speaker 2>superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you have more energy on </v>

2141
01:36:55.841 --> 01:36:55.841
<v Speaker 2>less sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your workouts are better.</v>

2142
01:36:55.841 --> 01:36:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the,</v>

2143
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:59.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like fish oil where when you take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of fish oil,</v>

2144
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of keep your fingers </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossed that it's working.</v>

2145
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can feel fish oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go destroy the world.</v>

2146
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even better than black ant extract.</v>

2147
01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get it to you.</v>

2148
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.030
<v Speaker 2>So I get it shipped to my house and I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a self administered push ivy.</v>

2149
01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I do the same thing with Myers </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktails.</v>

2150
01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 2>So I just shove a butterfly needle into </v>
<v Speaker 2>my vein and then I push this nad and </v>

2151
01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very slowly.</v>

2152
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:29.801
<v Speaker 2>And you can even chase it with a myers </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktail which enhances the </v>

2153
01:37:29.801 --> 01:37:29.801
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning you can do like a,</v>

2154
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.790
<v Speaker 2>an Nid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a common protocol and lot of</v>

2155
01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>anti aging clinics are a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2156
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:38.591
<v Speaker 2>like a alternative health clinics as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the Nad injection and you follow it </v>

2157
01:37:38.591 --> 01:37:40.610
<v Speaker 2>up with a myers cocktail and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like superman admires,</v>

2158
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.490
<v Speaker 2>that's just vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin infusion,</v>

2159
01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:47.870
<v Speaker 2>it's ivy infusion of vitamin B and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they'll nootropics and they're</v>

2160
01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:50.300
<v Speaker 2>like lithium and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much to remember,</v>

2161
01:37:50.301 --> 01:37:51.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2162
01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had a.</v>

2163
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm a complete idiot about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>except health and nutrition and fitness.</v>

2164
01:37:57.391 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 2>That's how like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2165
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch TV and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2166
01:38:01.031 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't follow politics or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2167
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I just studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep the poison out.</v>

2168
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2169
01:38:06.121 --> 01:38:11.121
<v Speaker 2>It's like Sherlock Holmes and Watson </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells us him him his name and he says </v>

2170
01:38:11.121 --> 01:38:15.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work hard to forget that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't want anything </v>

2171
01:38:15.471 --> 01:38:15.471
<v Speaker 2>cluttering up his head at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2172
01:38:15.471 --> 01:38:18.891
<v Speaker 2>Aside from his sleuthing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there an nad place in la where I </v>

2173
01:38:18.891 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>could go and do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2174
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.160
<v Speaker 2>there I was speaking with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday about this and he asked me if </v>

2175
01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I could find a clinic and I found one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Hills and uh,</v>

2176
01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:34.490
<v Speaker 2>it's probably an one of the long ivy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll want to wait till we have some</v>

2177
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:39.651
<v Speaker 2>computer work to do and you can sit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your laptop and just kind of get stuff </v>

2178
01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:40.810
<v Speaker 2>done six to eight hours or you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to Paul,</v>

2179
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.920
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can push it in and about 15 to 20 </v>

2180
01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 2>minutes and you can have a nurse </v>
<v Speaker 2>practitioner do this.</v>

2181
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:47.630
<v Speaker 2>And then there are some clinics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will do,</v>

2182
01:38:47.631 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 2>it's called a push ivy and nad push ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So beneficial.</v>

2183
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:56.421
<v Speaker 2>Just more painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this once a week now and it's </v>

2184
01:38:56.421 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 2>painful 10 to 20 minutes of my entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

2185
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but you feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

2186
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm testing my telomere length with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>company called Tello years.</v>

2187
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:09.370
<v Speaker 2>They say there's another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of the other company </v>

2188
01:39:09.370 --> 01:39:10.020
<v Speaker 2>that tests your telomere length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only a couple out there.</v>

2189
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So it tests the rate at which your </v>
<v Speaker 2>telomeres are shortening.</v>

2190
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And the two things that have had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most profound effect on my results from </v>

2191
01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:22.221
<v Speaker 2>that test have been the stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>injections intravenously and the Nad </v>

2192
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:25.350
<v Speaker 2>injections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my biological age right now,</v>

2193
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>which started off at an age of 37 when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 34 and then decreased to 35 when I </v>

2194
01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:37.971
<v Speaker 2>tested again at 36 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just tested it 37 years old and my </v>

2195
01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:42.441
<v Speaker 2>biological age is 20 in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate at which my telomeres are </v>

2196
01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:42.441
<v Speaker 2>shortening.</v>

2197
01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And the only two things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed have been the stem cell </v>

2198
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:48.060
<v Speaker 2>injections and the Nad injections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and biological age,</v>

2199
01:39:48.061 --> 01:39:53.061
<v Speaker 2>you can reverse your biological age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there is some side effects.</v>

2200
01:39:54.170 --> 01:39:55.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2201
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 2>so the telomere test is a test of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>white blood cell telomere length,</v>

2202
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.980
<v Speaker 2>which is not reflective of every cell in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

2203
01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2204
01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:04.850
<v Speaker 2>so technically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2205
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a,</v>

2206
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:09.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not an ironclad test with a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 2>research behind it,</v>

2207
01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:12.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's an approximate corollary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your biological age.</v>

2208
01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:15.600
<v Speaker 2>It's the best we have right now to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to test telomere length.</v>

2209
01:40:15.601 --> 01:40:16.860
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not going to pretend like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2210
01:40:16.861 --> 01:40:21.861
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gold standard test and I'm not </v>

2211
01:40:21.861 --> 01:40:21.861
<v Speaker 2>aware of a gold standard test for </v>
<v Speaker 2>telomere length,</v>

2212
01:40:21.861 --> 01:40:26.480
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you that I feel amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that telomere length is shortening.</v>

2213
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And those Nad injections just make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like superman.</v>

2214
01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So do you think it's a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things or do we,</v>

2215
01:40:33.190 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>would you attribute it more to the Nad </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the problem with this shit?</v>

2216
01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2217
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:38.740
<v Speaker 2>He's just so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's stuff you can do to enhance </v>

2219
01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 2>your own endogenous stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>

2220
01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about meat and I told </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about that study with the.</v>

2221
01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about the carnosine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blueberry extract.</v>

2222
01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:52.980
<v Speaker 2>That's one of chlorella is another </v>
<v Speaker 2>colostrum is fantastic for that,</v>

2223
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:56.620
<v Speaker 2>for endogenous stem cell health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coffee Berry fruit extract.</v>

2224
01:40:56.770 --> 01:41:01.770
<v Speaker 2>That's another really fascinating one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can buy that on Amazon as a </v>

2225
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:04.621
<v Speaker 2>powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I put a lot of this stuff in my </v>

2226
01:41:04.621 --> 01:41:04.621
<v Speaker 2>morning smoothie now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I wake up,</v>

2227
01:41:04.621 --> 01:41:04.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got Chlorella,</v>

2228
01:41:04.621 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I've got Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got this,</v>

2229
01:41:06.281 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff called Howdy Arco Bark Tea,</v>

2230
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:12.430
<v Speaker 2>which also enhances your own nad </v>
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>

2231
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 2>a colostrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone broth,</v>

2232
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C to enhance the bone broth </v>
<v Speaker 2>uptake.</v>

2233
01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So you can kind of make yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

2234
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:24.570
<v Speaker 2>a little cocktail of ingredients that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take in the morning without </v>

2235
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:24.570
<v Speaker 2>necessarily spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2236
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:29.580
<v Speaker 2>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks on a stem cell and extraction and </v>

2237
01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.281
<v Speaker 2>injections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about like having some </v>

2238
01:41:32.281 --> 01:41:34.591
<v Speaker 2>sort of an online thing where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>could subscribe to a protocol and you </v>

2239
01:41:34.591 --> 01:41:34.760
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2240
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.570
<v Speaker 2>what I thought about doing was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>making like a,</v>

2241
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.600
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a supplement or something like that </v>

2242
01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.480
<v Speaker 2>where you can take all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just combine it into a shake or into </v>

2243
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.641
<v Speaker 2>some kind of a supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going to buy out or </v>

2244
01:41:47.641 --> 01:41:47.680
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean some,</v>

2245
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:50.850
<v Speaker 2>some people who don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement industry or formulation to,</v>

2246
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just put all this stuff in</v>

2247
01:41:52.411 --> 01:41:53.220
<v Speaker 2>a capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2248
01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one compound can decrease the </v>

2249
01:41:58.290 --> 01:41:58.470
<v Speaker 2>absorbability of the other compound or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2250
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.480
<v Speaker 2>one compound will create an aesthetic or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alkaline scenario in which the other </v>

2251
01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:03.700
<v Speaker 2>one doesn't work well.</v>

2252
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So it would require a lot of testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately,</v>

2253
01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point I just blend it all in a </v>

2254
01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:13.621
<v Speaker 2>blender and kind of keep my fingers </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossed and dump it all into my big </v>

2255
01:42:13.621 --> 01:42:13.621
<v Speaker 2>biggest mug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like,</v>

2256
01:42:13.621 --> 01:42:15.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like you who knows so much about</v>

2257
01:42:15.911 --> 01:42:20.911
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a great resource if people </v>

2258
01:42:20.911 --> 01:42:23.521
<v Speaker 2>could subscribe to something and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys could put together some sort of a </v>

2259
01:42:23.521 --> 01:42:28.381
<v Speaker 2>protocol for people that would fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could follow it on a daily basis </v>

2260
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:28.960
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creating more work for me.</v>

2261
01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2262
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would,</v>

2263
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.630
<v Speaker 2>the problem is genetic variability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2264
01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Like this whole high fat diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2265
01:42:39.011 --> 01:42:39.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2266
01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I saw yesterday that you tweeted out a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2267
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Nina Teicholz is,</v>

2268
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>

2269
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:50.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging the high saturated fat </v>

2270
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:53.860
<v Speaker 2>intake and I love her and I love her </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach and I love the idea that she is</v>

2271
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:55.700
<v Speaker 2>getting a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
01:42:55.750 --> 01:43:00.700
<v Speaker 2>via the lobbying to focus less on grains</v>
<v Speaker 2>and high carb diet,</v>

2273
01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 2>which I think is helpful for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2274
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:05.920
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are genes are like the PPA,</v>

2275
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:10.921
<v Speaker 2>our one alpha gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would cause a little bit of an </v>

2276
01:43:10.921 --> 01:43:14.761
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory response to high intake of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fats or to a lot of saturated fats </v>

2277
01:43:15.551 --> 01:43:19.060
<v Speaker 2>without a lot of poly or mono </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsaturated fats there.</v>

2278
01:43:19.061 --> 01:43:24.061
<v Speaker 2>I think the last time that we talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about familial </v>

2279
01:43:24.061 --> 01:43:24.061
<v Speaker 2>hypercholesterolemia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2280
01:43:24.061 --> 01:43:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Where some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they shift to a Kenogenic or a high </v>

2281
01:43:29.010 --> 01:43:31.711
<v Speaker 2>fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it screws them from a metabolic </v>

2282
01:43:31.711 --> 01:43:32.350
<v Speaker 2>standpoint because they get not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>high cholesterol but you know,</v>

2283
01:43:32.351 --> 01:43:36.400
<v Speaker 2>high particle count and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oxidation of that cholesterol.</v>

2284
01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2285
01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:39.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2286
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:41.290
<v Speaker 2>there's ways around that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2287
01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:46.291
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a catava and diet would be what </v>

2288
01:43:46.291 --> 01:43:48.841
<v Speaker 2>you'd consume if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were eating or if you had this </v>

2289
01:43:48.841 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 2>familial hypercholesterolemia where he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a lot of tubers and fish and coconut</v>

2290
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.920
<v Speaker 2>meat and wild plants and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically like a 70 to 80 percent </v>

2291
01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.910
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate based diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with a lot of grains,</v>

2292
01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now with a lot of junk food.</v>

2293
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:04.670
<v Speaker 2>But that would be a diet more </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for someone with that issue.</v>

2294
01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone with a PPA,</v>

2295
01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:10.961
<v Speaker 2>our Jane issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd want to eat less of the coconut </v>

2296
01:44:10.961 --> 01:44:14.021
<v Speaker 2>oil and the butter and the cheeses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of like the Avocados and the extra </v>

2297
01:44:14.021 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>virgin olive oil and more of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean diet approach.</v>

2298
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:18.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier that the,</v>

2299
01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:21.980
<v Speaker 2>the fact that coconut oil and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these saturated fats and a lot of people</v>

2300
01:44:21.981 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 2>are inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would want to eat a lot of,</v>

2301
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of antioxidants and flavonols and </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyphenol rich,</v>

2302
01:44:28.110 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non sugary berries and dark leafy </v>

2303
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

2304
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you could have a subscription based </v>
<v Speaker 2>service that teaches people a lot of </v>

2305
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:38.920
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then once again,</v>

2306
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.660
<v Speaker 2>you got to have either artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that screening each person </v>

2307
01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 2>to look at what they actually need or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a real person talking to each</v>

2308
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:47.780
<v Speaker 2>person looking at their labs and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2309
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.670
<v Speaker 2>this is the one that would work well for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2310
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Rather than just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2311
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:52.810
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been smoothie,</v>

2312
01:44:52.811 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 2>everybody should be drinking this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2313
01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this one thing once where they</v>

2314
01:44:56.930 --> 01:45:01.930
<v Speaker 2>monitored my blood and I abandoned it </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately because they told me I </v>

2315
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:01.930
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have avocados.</v>

2316
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

2317
01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Igg Food Allergy tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is that you produce a </v>

2318
01:45:08.650 --> 01:45:09.950
<v Speaker 2>lot of these immunoglobulins to foods </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you eat a lot,</v>

2319
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.280
<v Speaker 2>so people will be of eggs and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this test and they walk out depressed </v>

2320
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:19.751
<v Speaker 2>with their tail between their legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can't have avocados and </v>

2321
01:45:19.751 --> 01:45:19.751
<v Speaker 2>eggs anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because they were eating a shit</v>

2322
01:45:19.751 --> 01:45:21.640
<v Speaker 2>ton of Avocados and eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The DM,</v>

2323
01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:22.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:45:22.101 --> 01:45:24.200
<v Speaker 2>There's one called the Cyrex food </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergy panel.</v>

2325
01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get this huge laundry list of </v>

2326
01:45:29.230 --> 01:45:30.630
<v Speaker 2>foods that give you false positives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty accurate test that I use.</v>

2327
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Knew it was nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2328
01:45:32.121 --> 01:45:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat Avocados all the time.</v>

2329
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:35.630
<v Speaker 2>This can be anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

2330
01:45:35.710 --> 01:45:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2331
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:41.981
<v Speaker 2>it's not nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they should immunoglobulin </v>

2332
01:45:41.981 --> 01:45:44.510
<v Speaker 2>reaction to Avocados and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies in the streets.</v>

2333
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 2>No evidence that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually are you.</v>

2334
01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:53.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you would have to go on some </v>

2335
01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.590
<v Speaker 2>sort of a very neutral diet for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

2336
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Get your body's baseline established </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly at your blood work,</v>

2337
01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:04.091
<v Speaker 2>done whatever rice for a month and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it taken proteins at all and even </v>

2338
01:46:05.271 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would that do?</v>

2339
01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Probably do like a wash out like a five </v>
<v Speaker 2>day fast and that's that.</v>

2340
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:12.800
<v Speaker 2>That new valter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Longo longevity diet is you do,</v>

2341
01:46:13.130 --> 01:46:16.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's five over the know once a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter,</v>

2342
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:18.230
<v Speaker 2>five day fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2343
01:46:18.231 --> 01:46:23.231
<v Speaker 2>To clean you out to get all the benefits</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cellular autophagy and with that </v>

2344
01:46:23.231 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 2>particular diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking before about how long term</v>

2345
01:46:25.551 --> 01:46:27.740
<v Speaker 2>calorie restriction is bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2346
01:46:27.741 --> 01:46:30.950
<v Speaker 2>and this whole idea of intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting with caloric restriction creates</v>

2347
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 2>hormone deficits and associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gallstones and all sorts of nasty things</v>

2348
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 2>happen to your body when you don't give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it enough calories.</v>

2349
01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:42.880
<v Speaker 2>What about long term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know when people go into those </v>

2350
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.190
<v Speaker 2>five day fast like Dom D'agostino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>valter,</v>

2351
01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:48.191
<v Speaker 2>Longo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his approach is you do a five day fast </v>

2352
01:46:48.191 --> 01:46:48.670
<v Speaker 2>just a few times a year and I think in </v>
<v Speaker 2>in active individuals,</v>

2353
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.840
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he only recommends like two or three </v>

2354
01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 2>times a year Max that you do this five </v>
<v Speaker 2>day fast and you put it in an off season</v>

2355
01:46:54.511 --> 01:46:59.511
<v Speaker 2>or recovery phase or some period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're not training heavily and </v>

2356
01:46:59.511 --> 01:47:03.231
<v Speaker 2>that scenario would allow you to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the cellular autophagy and the </v>

2357
01:47:03.231 --> 01:47:03.810
<v Speaker 2>cleanup benefits and theoretically you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do that,</v>

2358
01:47:03.811 --> 01:47:08.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then go get your food allergy tests </v>

2359
01:47:08.811 --> 01:47:10.790
<v Speaker 2>and see what kind of proteins are </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating around your brain and you're </v>

2360
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.790
<v Speaker 2>doing a 24 hour fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often?</v>

2361
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 2>What works for me because I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2362
01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:15.720
<v Speaker 2>not even for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too active.</v>

2363
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I just have too much shit going on.</v>

2364
01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there aren't many times during the </v>

2365
01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.740
<v Speaker 2>year when I could point out a five day </v>
<v Speaker 2>slot in my schedule where I'm not </v>

2366
01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 2>hunting or competing or working out or </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something that requires me to need</v>

2367
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:29.220
<v Speaker 2>calories or outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to.</v>

2368
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm already skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't go for a long time without </v>

2369
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.861
<v Speaker 2>eating and my metabolism is sky high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is a 12 to 16 hour fast </v>

2370
01:47:38.101 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a calorically restricted fast,</v>

2371
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but just 12 to 16 hours without eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day.</v>

2372
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:48.330
<v Speaker 2>On the lower activity days I'd taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>less protein and restricted meat.</v>

2373
01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the days where I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>beating up my body too much and like a </v>

2374
01:47:53.730 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday and a Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are more recovery days.</v>

2375
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Those were the days when I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2376
01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.560
<v Speaker 2>fricken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I close myself love days or like I do </v>

2377
01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.610
<v Speaker 2>clay masks and coffee enemas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrared therapy like.</v>

2378
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'm still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>

2379
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:07.050
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for upregulating,</v>

2380
01:48:07.051 --> 01:48:09.400
<v Speaker 2>your own glutathione production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your biopsy,</v>

2381
01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:14.220
<v Speaker 2>you feel clean as a whistle plus it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to get coffee up your,</v>

2382
01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but there's no other way that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do get a lot of caffeine absorption </v>

2383
01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:19.240
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

2384
01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've never done something like that</v>

2385
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:24.060
<v Speaker 2>and experienced what it feels like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be completely cleaned out,</v>

2386
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty good feeling towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>duty of the coffee enema not only cleans</v>

2387
01:48:28.981 --> 01:48:33.981
<v Speaker 2>out your colon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it causes your liver and your </v>

2388
01:48:33.981 --> 01:48:36.831
<v Speaker 2>gallbladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gallbladder specifically to increase </v>

2389
01:48:36.831 --> 01:48:38.871
<v Speaker 2>bile production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It upregulate your glutathione </v>

2390
01:48:38.871 --> 01:48:38.871
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your indulgence,</v>

2391
01:48:38.871 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and production.</v>

2392
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And so you're increasing your production</v>
<v Speaker 2>of antioxidants.</v>

2393
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:45.750
<v Speaker 2>And it also causes Paris dialysis while </v>
<v Speaker 2>she just moved stuff through.</v>

2394
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:47.550
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of moving slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once a week,</v>

2395
01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday mornings I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2396
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:54.850
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife makes coffee every morning and </v>

2397
01:48:54.850 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 2>have her make an extra pot as leave that</v>
<v Speaker 2>out on the counter until it gets to room</v>

2398
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:55.500
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

2399
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And normally when I'm drinking my </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>

2400
01:48:57.301 --> 01:49:02.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm going through all my morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and articles and everything </v>

2401
01:49:02.301 --> 01:49:02.301
<v Speaker 2>down in my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a standing desk in the basement,</v>

2402
01:49:02.301 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 2>but instead I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2403
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I lay on my right side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the bathroom floor and I keep </v>

2404
01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:12.021
<v Speaker 2>coughing in there for about 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm working and then I get up and </v>

2405
01:49:12.021 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 2>you just let it all out and you lay on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your coffee and your.</v>

2406
01:49:15.241 --> 01:49:17.640
<v Speaker 2>But I get a stainless steel animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket,</v>

2407
01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>so plastics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not injecting classics up your</v>

2408
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:27.270
<v Speaker 2>butt and then you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a quarter,</v>

2409
01:49:27.271 --> 01:49:29.980
<v Speaker 2>so have coffee in the back side with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this tube.</v>

2410
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:31.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2411
01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And then you lay on your right side for </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes and then you get up and you </v>

2412
01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.260
<v Speaker 2>let it all out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course I have the squatty potty </v>

2413
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:40.260
<v Speaker 2>so it comes up more easily.</v>

2414
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know of that kink in your photos and</v>

2415
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.350
<v Speaker 2>everything comes out and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk away just like whistling with a</v>

2416
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:48.770
<v Speaker 2>big smile on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's squatty potty is legit.</v>

2417
01:49:48.771 --> 01:49:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2418
01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it probably works really should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into a hole in the ground when I</v>

2419
01:49:52.661 --> 01:49:55.020
<v Speaker 2>don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I perch my best dumps.</v>

2420
01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:57.600
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm hunting or camping or on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet,</v>

2421
01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you hold onto a tree and you kinda do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dog person and it's perfect.</v>

2422
01:50:01.151 --> 01:50:06.151
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on those days that I'm doing coffee </v>

2423
01:50:06.151 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 2>enemas or sauna or any weird woo woo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that don't involve workouts,</v>

2424
01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:12.460
<v Speaker 2>I do protein restriction because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating up my body that much.</v>

2425
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Coffee Enema doesn't cause a lot of east</v>
<v Speaker 2>centric muscle tissue damage unless </v>

2426
01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.671
<v Speaker 2>you've done something horribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I basically have those days as my </v>

2427
01:50:20.671 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 2>lower protein days and then once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this would be,</v>

2428
01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:25.180
<v Speaker 2>unless I'm traveling because it's harder</v>
<v Speaker 2>to doing travel.</v>

2429
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I do a 24 hour fast Saturday at dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stop eating,</v>

2430
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:34.110
<v Speaker 2>sleep all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All he gotta do is skip breakfast on </v>

2431
01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:36.511
<v Speaker 2>Sunday and skip lunch on Sunday and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>have dinner on Sunday night and that's </v>

2432
01:50:36.511 --> 01:50:40.411
<v Speaker 2>pretty easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I get the benefits of the longer </v>

2433
01:50:40.411 --> 01:50:40.411
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2434
01:50:40.411 --> 01:50:44.191
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of those cellular </v>
<v Speaker 2>autophagy and endogenous stem cell </v>

2435
01:50:44.191 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 2>production benefits don't kick in until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're about 16 hours in.</v>

2436
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get that benefit once a week even </v>

2437
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:51.070
<v Speaker 2>though for me really it comes out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>about twice a month that I'm actually at</v>

2438
01:50:51.071 --> 01:50:56.071
<v Speaker 2>home because I travel so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that full 24 hour fast and I do a </v>

2439
01:50:56.071 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 2>lot of work that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I play with my kids,</v>

2440
01:50:56.981 --> 01:51:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I just feel things in throughout that </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to keep my appetite satiated.</v>

2441
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they'll do some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>new ketone esters and sometimes we'll do</v>

2442
01:51:05.501 --> 01:51:10.501
<v Speaker 2>some amino acids or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cup of bone broth doesn't count as </v>

2443
01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:11.110
<v Speaker 2>breaking your fast kind of sword of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating.</v>

2444
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2445
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a speed bump for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny,</v>

2446
01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high metabolism guy like me to have like</v>

2447
01:51:16.661 --> 01:51:19.390
<v Speaker 2>a cup of 40 calorie bone broth in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the day.</v>

2448
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:23.560
<v Speaker 2>The bone broth fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ketone esters also break your fast.</v>

2449
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.950
<v Speaker 2>They're a caloric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm technically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:29.140
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from just a pure,</v>

2452
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:31.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple physiology standpoint.</v>

2453
01:51:31.001 --> 01:51:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Your body would need to utilize those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones for energy before it would,</v>

2454
01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn some of your own Acetol Coa,</v>

2455
01:51:38.201 --> 01:51:40.540
<v Speaker 2>a derived from your fat into extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones.</v>

2456
01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 2>But I just liked the way I feel on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting using these,</v>

2457
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:49.291
<v Speaker 2>these especially like the newer ketone </v>
<v Speaker 2>esters in the case on why aren't you </v>

2458
01:51:49.291 --> 01:51:51.370
<v Speaker 2>supposed to take them with glucose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2459
01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:52.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2460
01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:57.720
<v Speaker 2>You are going to get a huge performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage by taking them with glucose,</v>

2461
01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2462
01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2463
01:52:01.810 --> 01:52:06.810
<v Speaker 2>it's an ancestrally inappropriate state </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the human body to have </v>

2464
01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously elevated levels of blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose and elevated levels of blood </v>

2465
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.661
<v Speaker 2>ketones because traditionally we'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevated our blood ketones through </v>

2466
01:52:15.661 --> 01:52:19.710
<v Speaker 2>fasting and while I'm okay with </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevating blood key tones via a non </v>

2467
01:52:19.751 --> 01:52:24.751
<v Speaker 2>ancestral roots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as the consumption of these ketone </v>

2468
01:52:24.751 --> 01:52:26.260
<v Speaker 2>esters designed by the US Department of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Defense for soldiers in battle,</v>

2469
01:52:26.261 --> 01:52:31.261
<v Speaker 2>they have to go two or three days </v>
<v Speaker 2>without eating or for Tour de France </v>

2470
01:52:31.261 --> 01:52:31.261
<v Speaker 2>riders have been using them for awhile.</v>

2471
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:36.570
<v Speaker 2>The idea of consuming glucose along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those ketones and spiking blood glucose,</v>

2472
01:52:37.331 --> 01:52:40.090
<v Speaker 2>which can have a little bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory oxidative effect,</v>

2473
01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:45.330
<v Speaker 2>is not something I would do unless I </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like in a race or in a really hard </v>

2474
01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:50.261
<v Speaker 2>demanding workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where something like that you </v>

2475
01:52:50.261 --> 01:52:52.751
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use like rocket fuel and that's </v>

2476
01:52:52.751 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 2>actually a very good mix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of like a fruit dose,</v>

2477
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:58.241
<v Speaker 2>Maltodextrin blend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the gatorade sports science </v>

2478
01:52:58.241 --> 01:53:01.091
<v Speaker 2>institute has shown allows you to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really high absorption of carbohydrates </v>

2479
01:53:01.091 --> 01:53:01.580
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2480
01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>just Maltodextrin or just glucose or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fruit dose.</v>

2481
01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Then you add in Ketone esters on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then to stave off what's called</v>

2482
01:53:08.481 --> 01:53:13.481
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crossing of trip to fan into the </v>

2483
01:53:13.481 --> 01:53:13.481
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of makes you feel,</v>

2484
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:14.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey dinner,</v>

2485
01:53:14.331 --> 01:53:19.331
<v Speaker 2>sleepy effect during exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You throw essential amino acids into </v>

2486
01:53:19.331 --> 01:53:19.760
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got amino acids,</v>

2487
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.590
<v Speaker 2>ketones and glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that mix is just pure rocket fuel.</v>

2488
01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked about that last time you said</v>

2489
01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:31.181
<v Speaker 2>it was like being on steroids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>having glucose in your system with </v>

2490
01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:31.181
<v Speaker 2>ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking crazy.</v>

2491
01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2492
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:32.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2493
01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you go on these fast,</v>

2494
01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:42.130
<v Speaker 2>if you drink coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does coffee break your fast coffee or </v>

2495
01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:45.500
<v Speaker 2>the consumption of anything from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>circadian biology,</v>

2496
01:53:45.501 --> 01:53:47.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four hour circadian rhythm.</v>

2497
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got multiple Circadian Rhythm Qs,</v>

2498
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.660
<v Speaker 2>one is movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you travel and you're jet </v>

2499
01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.481
<v Speaker 2>lagged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement helps you normalize your </v>

2500
01:53:58.481 --> 01:53:58.481
<v Speaker 2>biological clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another is light,</v>

2501
01:53:58.481 --> 01:54:03.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so exposure to high amounts of morning </v>

2502
01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 2>sunlight or using one of these new </v>
<v Speaker 2>fangled hacking devices like the,</v>

2503
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.740
<v Speaker 2>like the light or the in Ir Light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another circadian q eating or </v>

2504
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 2>really the consumption of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supplements,</v>

2505
01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.500
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tea,</v>

2506
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:14.930
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also a circadian q.</v>

2507
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:20.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a researcher dr satchin panda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's got some really good research on </v>

2508
01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:24.911
<v Speaker 2>circadian rhythmicity and what he says </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the consumption of anything can </v>

2509
01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.040
<v Speaker 2>disrupt circadian biology.</v>

2510
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:32.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're fasting for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating your circadian rhythms,</v>

2511
01:54:32.421 --> 01:54:35.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've got insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor sleep patterns,</v>

2512
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.240
<v Speaker 2>inflammation due to lack of sleep or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of the glymphatic drainage and </v>

2513
01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.620
<v Speaker 2>consolidation of memory and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that occurs during deep sleep.</v>

2514
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Your sleep is more or less fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2515
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:49.631
<v Speaker 2>Like that would be a situation in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just wouldn't want to eat anything </v>

2516
01:54:49.631 --> 01:54:53.950
<v Speaker 2>during a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're fastest for the purposes </v>

2517
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:56.561
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say like fat loss or even some of </v>

2518
01:54:56.561 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the endogenous stem cell production</v>

2519
01:54:56.571 --> 01:55:01.571
<v Speaker 2>benefits of fasting and a caloric cup of</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee is not going to cause any issues.</v>

2520
01:55:02.001 --> 01:55:07.001
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're concerned about like the </v>

2521
01:55:07.001 --> 01:55:08.921
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol is in the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the paper filter because you're </v>

2522
01:55:08.921 --> 01:55:09.710
<v Speaker 2>going to filter out most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol as well versus like a french</v>

2523
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:12.080
<v Speaker 2>press or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or steel filter.</v>

2524
01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about water?</v>

2525
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Water I think is completely allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some people who do dry </v>

2526
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:23.801
<v Speaker 2>fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a that will be popular for people who </v>

2527
01:55:23.801 --> 01:55:26.981
<v Speaker 2>have like candida or yeast or fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would claim that a moist </v>

2528
01:55:26.981 --> 01:55:27.410
<v Speaker 2>environment would allow the bacteria to </v>
<v Speaker 2>flourish.</v>

2529
01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And so some of those people will do dry </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>

2530
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy who does dry fasting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>autologous urine therapy where he does </v>

2531
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:37.760
<v Speaker 2>dry fast in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drinks his urine and.</v>

2532
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's some old ayurvedic cleanse </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniQue that I,</v>

2533
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were trying.</v>

2534
01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I did</v>

2535
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2536
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I try to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2537
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:48.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sort of the best.</v>

2538
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the temperature got to me more </v>

2539
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:54.180
<v Speaker 1>than the taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the warm hotness,</v>

2540
01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.960
<v Speaker 1>just it felt from the tactile to alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2541
01:55:57.961 --> 01:55:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2542
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:05.350
<v Speaker 1>So ultimately the coffee is not an issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're putting a bunch of stuff </v>

2543
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.350
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2544
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:10.190
<v Speaker 1>and then even though it is admittedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>noninsulin agentic and it's actually </v>

2545
01:56:10.190 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 1>quite a kick in the pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2546
01:56:11.521 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you know when you blend fats with </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

2547
01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you get the cough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stall on the hallway,</v>

2548
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 1>all they cross the blood brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they amp you up psychologically.</v>

2549
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:23.510
<v Speaker 1>You're also getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body has to burn those calories </v>

2550
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.510
<v Speaker 1>before it burns a lot of its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>

2551
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So that's not something you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would do well on a facet.</v>

2552
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Stayed bent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to wrap this up,</v>

2553
01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2557

<v Speaker 1>the Past couple of hours as I want.</v>
