1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how so,</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>so I've got just about been open for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years with CSA.</v>

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>We had zero members when we started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got about $1,300,</v>

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>which was the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made you the motivation was that I</v>

5
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always a passion.</v>

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I was doing martial arts when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child that was fighting.</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I just wasn't making money doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I got into that other life and did</v>

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>that for about 15 years and I was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid to protect people that could afford</v>

9
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it but maybe didn't deserve it for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately that's the way it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works is if you can afford it,</v>

11
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny way of looking at.</v>

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a true way of looking at it because</v>

14
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it at the highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing security work at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids' choice awards,</v>

16
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>standing Jim Carey for two hours saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jim Carey's bodyguard.</v>

17
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of those things where I saw</v>

18
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>it at the very highest level and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

19
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it turned me off after awhile because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>you're being a babysitter to people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have money.</v>

22
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Even with the biggest threats from Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

23
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>a Haiti run down the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about helping people and I was</v>

24
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>wanting to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get it.</v>

25
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I opened the gym,</v>

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>that was the goal was to help people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

27
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>it turned into that gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I feel that our gym</v>

28
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>model is successful is because tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 5:30 during a boxing class,</v>

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>my professional fighters are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in class with everyone else.</v>

30
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only practice.</v>

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody trains together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody works together.</v>

32
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>The model is for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get in shape,</v>

33
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get into shape.</v>

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You want to have stress relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

35
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>You want to become a fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

36
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a fight team practice try</v>
<v Speaker 1>out or any of that.</v>

37
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>You come to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put in the work,</v>

38
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>you support the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trained side by side with world</v>

39
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get better,</v>

40
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>you have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge family gym.</v>

41
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge family environment and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixture of the self defense and the</v>

42
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>fighting and the fitness one doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need the other.</v>

43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So unlike like an Aka and I love hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gym is about the fighters.</v>

44
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Fighters lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fight.</v>

45
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>People go out the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of a fight or lose,</v>

47
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>my membership's not going to matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are still gonna come,</v>

48
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>they're still going to train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still gonna support.</v>

49
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>They're still going to buy tickets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been the recipe.</v>

50
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And because the gym is that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's allowed me to have this model where</v>

51
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't charge pro fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're remarkably normal.</v>

52
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

53
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I know people restricted at how normal I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

54
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.631
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

55
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my reputation through maze,</v>

56
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>a famous child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very unusual maze.</v>

57
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

58
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is unique to me.</v>

59
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

60
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost got peerless person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to a certain extent,</v>

61
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>there's not too many people I can look</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and right.</v>

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>contacted,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it through and seems pretty put</v>

67

<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

68
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

69
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird cold call,</v>

70
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

71
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Jodie foster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a small clan people,</v>

72
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>like if a comic called me that I knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to talk to me,</v>

73
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to them because it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small club of people.</v>

74
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do have our weekly therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions.</v>

75
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>You know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elijah Wood,</v>

77
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Jodie Foster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

78
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we all get together and yeah,</v>

79
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

80
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've actually,</v>

81
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>we do primal screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

82
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I was describing what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who,</v>

83
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricky Schroder who uh,</v>

84
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.163
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it was a very famous when he</v>

86
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>was young as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite theme songs,</v>

87
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 1>TV theme songs of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying like you,</v>

88
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the way you developed is not like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the recipe calls,</v>

89
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like the recipe calls for you to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and try to figure out life and</v>

90
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>then become a man and trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and then try to find your path.</v>

91
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And by the time you he became a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was already famous.</v>

92
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing with you.</v>

93
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>You were already famous as you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing and learning.</v>

94
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how to like kind of</v>

95
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:27.181
<v Speaker 1>even describe it because it's always the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way my life has been kind of thing in</v>

96
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the same way that like a lot of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

97
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd go out and they catch bugs and</v>

98
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>play sandlot baseball or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just look at it like that's the way</v>

99
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really realize how unique</v>

100
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation is until you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because you have nothing to</v>

101
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>compare it to really other than I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>tv shows and movies and things like</v>

102
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that my upbringing was unique,</v>

103
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it knew it was different,</v>

104
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not until you get some perspective,</v>

105
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>some life experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until you really realize that,</v>

106
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

107
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.470
<v Speaker 1>this was particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you brought up an interesting what</v>

109
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:06.241
<v Speaker 2>would leopold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>leopold this disciple,</v>

110
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father of modern wildlife ecology,</v>

111
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:14.491
<v Speaker 2>started the first program of Wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ecology at University of Wisconsin in</v>

112
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:19.621
<v Speaker 2>the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations of deer in the northern part</v>

113
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>of Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're growing by leaps and bounds and</v>

114
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 2>they were dramatically changing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape,</v>

115
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denuding the landscape,</v>

116
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating eastern white cedar and deer in</v>

117
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>northern latitudes tend to yard together</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wintertime.</v>

118
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.470
<v Speaker 2>And so leopold knew that this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 2>deleterious to the longterm viability of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ecosystem.</v>

120
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 2>He took people out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landowners out hunters out into these</v>

121
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 2>deer yards in the spring to show them</v>
<v Speaker 2>how there was nothing to eat within</v>

122
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>reach of a deer on its hind feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were bodies of dead deer that</v>

123
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>had stopped through the wintertime in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to demonstrate to them the</v>

124
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>consequences of mismanagement if deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts.</v>

125
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>So he and he was a real proponent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing people the results of doing</v>

126
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.750
<v Speaker 2>things the wrong way and education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think yeah,</v>

127
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're trying to do,</v>

128
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>not saying that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're leopold in or anything like that,</v>

129
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>but education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting information out,</v>

130
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 2>getting accurate information out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's maybe one of the biggest things we</v>

131
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>

132
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Like no one ever feels like they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything special and you always like if</v>

133
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 3>there were any good they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you always ruthlessly self critical</v>

134
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 3>and trying to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've worked with big actors,</v>

135
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Rock Stars and the big rockstars,</v>

136
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 3>like one big rockstar once one time said</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

137
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I opened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

138
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 3>is there anyone out there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

139
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 19,000 people smell the wd 40.</v>

140
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 3>That's how they got the last thousand</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in.</v>

141
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

142
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm always worried that no one's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show up.</v>

143
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was that ever been your problem?</v>

144
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.931
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

145
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who is this?</v>

146
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 3>So He's another guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>is it going to be okay in there?</v>

208
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding?</v>

209
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 3>You were handcuffed with lenny bruce in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of a cop car and you're asking</v>

210
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 3>me if it's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was He handcuffed?</v>

211
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that great book.</v>

212
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.600
<v Speaker 3>A great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

213
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Bruce,</v>

214
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones cannot now go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

215
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 1>just go to the other youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't another residential.</v>

216
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go to the other facebook.</v>

217
00:09:41.651 --> 00:09:44.590
<v Speaker 1>There isn't another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to recognize that the way we</v>

218
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>are organized as a society that the town</v>
<v Speaker 1>square is now owned by corporations who</v>

219
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that need to be regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

220
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Like before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know when 18 t was the phone</v>

221
00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:55.510
<v Speaker 1>carrier for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't go.</v>

222
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>service because I don't like the Shit</v>

223
00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:00.320
<v Speaker 1>shitty saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

224
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't deny services somebody,</v>

225
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that's not really a valid</v>

226
00:10:05.081 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 1>comparison because the phone service</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't distributed information to</v>

227
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:09.920
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The phone service is just a method of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

229
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It was just a utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's able to do through info wars</v>

230
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.380
<v Speaker 1>is if you've got them on your platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to say some things and he's</v>

231
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>going to use your platform to say some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you know,</v>

232
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.460
<v Speaker 1>might not be true.</v>

233
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It might be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to decide like when does</v>

234
00:10:27.371 --> 00:10:30.280
<v Speaker 1>it become a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think where they drew the line</v>

235
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:32.140
<v Speaker 1>with Sandy Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I say,</v>

236
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 1>we need to treat these as public</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilities because they are right</v>

238
00:10:37.061 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no alternative.</v>

239
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.590
<v Speaker 1>There is an alternative to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to regulate them.</v>

240
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a long overdue by the way.</v>

241
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And they are monopolies where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to everyone that they're</v>

242
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:47.860
<v Speaker 1>monopolies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

243
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:49.420
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you invent something called</v>

244
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:51.610
<v Speaker 1>whatsapp and then facebook buys it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,</v>

245
00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a monopoly,</v>

246
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to,</v>

247
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.270
<v Speaker 1>to compete with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are monopolies.</v>

248
00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 1>They need to be regulated and people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be protected and it it,</v>

249
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.970
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>

250
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.690
<v Speaker 1>That's where we need to go because right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're leaving it up to the whims of</v>

251
00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:08.050
<v Speaker 1>a billion.</v>

252
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

253
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:11.980
<v Speaker 1>if Alex Jones really did some shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong and he should be taken off,</v>

254
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 1>or his free speech should be a bridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

255
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

256
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a court or go to a thing or go.</v>

257
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.151
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

258
00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:22.180
<v Speaker 1>he docks his people and he did it is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>doxing is illegal,</v>

259
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.700
<v Speaker 1>he should be prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what happened,</v>

260
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't take away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he docs people?</v>

261
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying he's done.</v>

262
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He'd wanted he docs people from newtown</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever from the school shooting,</v>

263
00:11:32.831 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 1>so that's what they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The individuals that he gave their</v>

264
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 1>addresses and their names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they are saying,</v>

265
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:40.630
<v Speaker 1>that he decay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's find out if he actually did</v>

266
00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that because that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

267
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

268
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did not saying what he actually</v>

269
00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

270
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing that he promoted the idea</v>

271
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:56.491
<v Speaker 1>that sandy hook was a false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was false and that it was a false</v>

272
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>flag and that these were all actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he actually said that.</v>

273
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I think what he actually said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that happened.</v>

274
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he actually said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are saying,</v>

275
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's promoting the idea that it was a</v>

276
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>hoax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know if that's what he</v>

277
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:15.641
<v Speaker 1>really said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

278
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's even the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've heard it.</v>

279
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it written that he promoted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that sandy hook was a</v>

280
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did not quoting.</v>

281
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>When they say that there's no quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

282
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook was a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kids were actors.</v>

283
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Those kids are not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that anywhere.</v>

284
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep attributing that to him</v>

285
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 1>without quotation.</v>

286
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this.</v>

287
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>If there was some kind of process due</v>
<v Speaker 1>process where you could go back and look</v>

288
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:43.970
<v Speaker 1>at the transcript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this.</v>

289
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if during this whole time where he's</v>

290
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Speaker 1>being tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was still labeled to be on youtube</v>

291
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and have his videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could show in his videos that he</v>

292
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>didn't say that he could show what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually said and tell you what he</v>

293
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>actually said and show clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't do that anymore.</v>

294
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So now the narrative is completely in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hands of the mainstream media.</v>

295
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Alex Jones narrative is being</v>

296
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>taken 100 percent out of his hands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's in the mainstream media.</v>

297
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And now there's sandy hook deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theorists,</v>

298
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>right wing lunatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>

299
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Which mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some of it.</v>

300
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking nuts.</v>
