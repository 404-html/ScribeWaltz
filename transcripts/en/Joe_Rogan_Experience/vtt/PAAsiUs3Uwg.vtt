4
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.204
<v Speaker 1>Facebook phone?</v>

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung is going to release something called the Galaxy Mega.</v>

7
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

8
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

9
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:12.541
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

10
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's six inches.</v>

11
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's two versions of it.</v>

12
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a 5.8 inch and a 6.3 inch.</v>

13
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.101
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

14
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

15
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>That's not a phone.</v>

16
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.061
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do it?</v>

17
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

18
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

19
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy thing.</v>

20
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

21
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.561
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what that is.</v>

22
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That's some cross crossover world thing that you have to have a man first to</v>

23
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.224
<v Speaker 1>carry that around.</v>

24
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Or a woman and woman would be excellent.</v>

25
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>If I was a girl and I had a bag,</v>

26
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>girls are allowed to carry purses,</v>

28
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>which is so awesome.</v>

29
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing they have got us with,</v>

31
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>with this society,</v>

32
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.301
<v Speaker 1>not women,</v>

33
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>but the societies got us whipped with this stupid idea that somehow or another,</v>

34
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a man's on a lot of carry a purse.</v>

35
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't record the Robin Hood days.</v>

36
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Those mother fuckers had shoulder bags.</v>

37
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to wear a backpack.</v>

39
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a backpack like I'm a fucking school kid.</v>

40
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Went through to two.</v>

41
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives me a hard time with it,</v>

42
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but if I wear a fanny pack,</v>

43
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>they will look at me like someone,</v>

44
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>God damn freaking nature.</v>

45
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.191
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you folks,</v>

46
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>we got to take back the fanny packs.</v>

47
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Go to take back the fanny pack and maybe even introduce a fucking purse.</v>

48
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

49
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>How about them apples?</v>

50
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself a purse,</v>

51
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.724
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

52
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

53
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>you got a little man purse.</v>

55
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that man.</v>

56
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's something somehow or another feminine or weak about</v>

57
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.451
<v Speaker 1>carrying around a bag is a perplexing aspect of this society.</v>

58
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.241
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

59
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

60
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>We are allowed to carry certain bags.</v>

61
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're carrying like a military style Duffel bag,</v>

62
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

63
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but you're not allowed to have a purse.</v>

64
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't go through the airport with a purse.</v>

65
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Dudes will laugh at you.</v>

66
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Dudes with backpacks,</v>

67
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>carrying duffle bags will laugh at you.</v>

68
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a purse,</v>

69
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you this guy with his fucking purse.</v>

70
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.341
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

71
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:53.881
<v Speaker 1>A purse,</v>

72
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

73
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You go to fucking prison.</v>

74
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>What is that difference between the fucking person?</v>

75
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>A backpack?</v>

76
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

77
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.231
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

78
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

79
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>A duffel bags.</v>

80
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And I can't have a fucking purse.</v>

82
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>

83
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>We have subjected ourselves to some nonsense that we just have accepted over the</v>

84
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>years and now it's become culture and Brian Red Bank.</v>

85
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>God bless you for breaking the mold,</v>

86
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>young man.</v>

87
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.561
<v Speaker 1>God bless you.</v>

88
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Keep my zantax.</v>

89
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.840

90
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.530

91
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>but is that I have from drinking too much heartburn medicine.</v>

92
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You take heartburn medicine.</v>

93
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
