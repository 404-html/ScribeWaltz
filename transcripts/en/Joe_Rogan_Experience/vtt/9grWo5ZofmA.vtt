<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>The everybody Zol Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct way to say it?</v>

4
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Istvan.</v>

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

7
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're a guy who's a trans humanism</v>
<v Speaker 1>expert,</v>

8
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and you sound like a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're names.</v>

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean Zoltan you sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

10
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>like an evil robot from another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the name sounds like no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no insult meant no,</v>

12
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

13
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty bizarre name.</v>

15
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Esoteric in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strangely enough.</v>

16
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the most common Hungarian name is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

17
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:52.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you say in a movie theater in a </v>

18
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:52.511
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get five people to turn around.</v>

19
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:52.511
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:52.511
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it sounds a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spend a bit spacey.</v>

23
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So Zoltan is like the equivalent of joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact because like when someone says </v>

24
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a crowd,</v>

25
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I assume it's someone else always.</v>

26
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>There's just so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn Joe's.</v>

27
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So Zoltan is the Hungarian Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

30
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>You save on the street and you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people turning around for sure.</v>

31
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it's very funny though that your name is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zoltan and you are a trans humanism </v>

34
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

35
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>the irony cannot be lost on you in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

36
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the median points that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>too because uh,</v>

37
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing ideas that are pretty </v>

39
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certainly far out there and in</v>

40
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the name sort of just emphasizes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it.</v>

41
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>What do you think when it comes to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a very controversial subject </v>

42
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.321
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are resisting the inevitability of </v>

43
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:47.321
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>this relationship that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology the,</v>

45
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the continuation of this inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

46
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason don't like it.</v>

47
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>They want things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to go back to chopping wood.</v>

48
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:03.761
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's some people that </v>

49
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>are digging in their heels when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to technological progress.</v>

50
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is like one of the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that?</v>

51
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anything that's foreign to </v>

52
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>people sort of scares them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as human beings,</v>

53
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 1>we have a kind of a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity to just take our time and </v>

54
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.681
<v Speaker 1>adapting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unless it's like a snake in the </v>

55
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't react really quickly.</v>

56
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>People tend to like want to take it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

57
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>discuss it with their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends,</v>

58
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>government and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this huge,</v>

59
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>almost like I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paradigm shift about to occur where,</v>

60
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing things like already starting</v>

61
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 1>to put microchips in people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're uh,</v>

62
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can take photos from the atmosphere </v>

63
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>and look at ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's surveillance issues.</v>

64
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all drone use.</v>

65
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a million different things going</v>

66
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>on with technology and science and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming so fast so quickly.</v>

67
00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It's scaring a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that not normally be</v>

68
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
<v Speaker 3>so frightened if it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>individually had come at some separate </v>

69
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just coming all at once.</v>

70
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 3>just even looking at the equipment in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this room,</v>

72
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even 10 years ago,</v>

73
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this wasn't like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

74
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

75
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.111
<v Speaker 3>if you're not accustomed to it or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a little bit afraid of some of </v>

76
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 3>the change you might back off from and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

77
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

78
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 3>This is too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

79
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

80
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.541
<v Speaker 3>for those of us who love it and who see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as very useful and functional and </v>

81
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 3>improving wellbeing and health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

82
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.560
<v Speaker 3>this type of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this type of change is,</v>

83
00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really great.</v>

84
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any apprehensions at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>

85
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 3>the sort of exponential growth of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology?</v>

86
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly have lots of apprehension.</v>

87
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 3>I think the biggest thing I'm worried </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

88
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 3>and you've been hearing about this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the news recently is,</v>

89
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 3>is artificial intelligence.</v>

90
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 3>This idea that there'll be another </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity on the planet that is smarter or </v>

91
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 3>smarter than us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equal to us,</v>

92
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing and could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>become so much smarter than us in such a</v>

93
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:05.011
<v Speaker 3>short time that it could literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally changed the way you know,</v>

94
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 3>our earth actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

95
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 3>I've also done a controls all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines in this room and all the </v>

96
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 3>airplanes and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For whatever reason,</v>

97
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.660
<v Speaker 3>it could certainly stop the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say out or at least progress and as </v>

98
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 3>we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good thing?</v>

99
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are.</v>

100
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 3>These are very touchy and difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>

101
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about it is certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>scary and that's the one thing that I've</v>

102
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 3>kind of agreed with a lot of the experts</v>
<v Speaker 3>lately saying that,</v>

103
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we probably need to have some type of </v>

104
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.760
<v Speaker 3>oversight.</v>

105
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I was recently at a speaking on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and singularity </v>

106
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 3>conference and that we were on a panel </v>
<v Speaker 3>of five experts talking about ai and a,</v>

107
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 3>someone asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

108
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 3>who is regulating artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence development?</v>

109
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 3>And all the experts had no one said </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything because no one said there </v>

110
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.361
<v Speaker 3>really is anything regulating this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that may be and potentially eight to 12,</v>

111
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 3>probably 20 years there will be this </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity that's smarter than us on planet </v>

112
00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

113
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>that seems a little bit of a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like regular in </v>

114
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>regulatory things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

115
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 3>maybe for this one is something we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

116
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 3>So I have a lot of apprehension when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to that single concept,</v>

117
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but most of the other technologies I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think um,</v>

118
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 3>as long as the historically they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing life spans and are making </v>

119
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.551
<v Speaker 3>people live better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty is going down across the world </v>

120
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:23.551
<v Speaker 3>because of technology.</v>

121
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

122
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>from a statistical point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology has helped and I'm pretty </v>

123
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 3>pretty sure it's going to continue to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

124
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's made kind of freely </v>
<v Speaker 3>available to everyone.</v>

125
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's two schools of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought when it comes to artificial </v>

126
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is the Elon musk school </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's like,</v>

127
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

128
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>we might be summoning the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was his exact quote,</v>

129
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:49.471
<v Speaker 3>which is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the other school of </v>

130
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 3>thought where people are saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to worry about it because</v>

131
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 3>they will only react in the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>programmed them to react.</v>

132
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 3>That when we create some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial life form that will have very</v>

133
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>strict</v>

134
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.580
<v Speaker 4>parameters of what it can and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

135
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 4>we've seen that in science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies before.</v>

136
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Like they have a protocol if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>harm human beings,</v>

137
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have these,</v>

138
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 4>these things that are programmed into </v>
<v Speaker 4>their behavior patterns that cannot be </v>

139
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.000
<v Speaker 4>overridden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think the real concern,</v>

140
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.820
<v Speaker 4>at least my real concern is that we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving birth to this new superior form </v>

141
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:27.131
<v Speaker 4>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the way I've described it is </v>

142
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:29.231
<v Speaker 4>that we're essentially a caterpillar </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't recognize that it's going </v>

143
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:33.261
<v Speaker 4>to become a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That we are toiling away creating this </v>

144
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 4>ant hill or whatever we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

145
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 4>We're just involved in this constant </v>
<v Speaker 4>growth,</v>

146
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 4>constant technological innovation </v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

147
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.120
<v Speaker 4>And we don't even realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our whole purpose here was to create </v>

148
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 4>this new thing was to create this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>life form.</v>

149
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a big proponent of that entire </v>

150
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 4>idea because as I point out in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my book,</v>

151
00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 4>the transhumanist wager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of what evolution is going towards</v>

152
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.920
<v Speaker 4>is not what we think it's going or what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we wanted</v>

153
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.030
<v Speaker 3>to go towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

154
00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

155
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:10.441
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the institutions of marriage and </v>

156
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:10.441
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Continuing.</v>

157
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I actually think what evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 3>really been leading to is the creation </v>

158
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really incredible superpower,</v>

159
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.160
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say God,</v>

160
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:23.161
<v Speaker 3>but something that has omnipotence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that is something that is </v>

161
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.840
<v Speaker 3>perfect and it's in its form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe just becoming alive through</v>

162
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

163
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very early in the process of that.</v>

164
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 3>I would say we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

166
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.830
<v Speaker 3>10 percent along along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just kind of kids in the universe.</v>

167
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

168
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.280
<v Speaker 3>the idea is eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

169
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.390
<v Speaker 3>the key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I worked through my apprehension</v>

171
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 3>of artificial intelligence is I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to merge with it.</v>

172
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 3>I would like to have it so that we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>connect it through a neural implants or </v>

173
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.180
<v Speaker 3>whatever it's going to be into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>

174
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like the machine's leave us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we leave with the machines and</v>

175
00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:01.591
<v Speaker 3>that's the natural state of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore we actually become that and </v>

176
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:01.591
<v Speaker 3>it's like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

177
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:04.600
<v Speaker 3>the Caterpillar idea where the butterfly</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually then becomes something else.</v>

178
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I see not only humanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

179
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 3>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

180
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of evolutionary course of the </v>

181
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.551
<v Speaker 3>universe which is sort of moving towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>this a much more incredible of an </v>

182
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.660
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible energy forums.</v>

183
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is that's going to end up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to end up being done</v>

184
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 3>the most important things that humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

185
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Don't</v>

186
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 4>miss the train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if one of the things that </v>

187
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.840
<v Speaker 4>people are concerned with is that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy a lot of our flaws and if,</v>

188
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 4>if we keep improving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if technology comes along and gets to </v>

189
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.571
<v Speaker 4>the point where a human being becomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>free of any irrational thoughts,</v>

190
00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:47.571
<v Speaker 4>free of irrational emotions are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe even any emotions we were </v>

191
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>missing out on rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're missing out on Charles Bukowski.</v>

192
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.330
<v Speaker 4>We're missing out on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

193
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 4>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the stupid</v>

194
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 3>shit that makes life fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like completely </v>

195
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're not gonna.</v>

196
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 3>No one's gonna be getting drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to be making dirty jokes.</v>

197
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>We're going to miss out on like fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

198
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 3>like ridiculous ice cream Sundaes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

199
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:16.911
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lot that we enjoy </v>

200
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:20.030
<v Speaker 3>about life that is ultimately ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as we continue to get smarter and as</v>

201
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:27.291
<v Speaker 3>technology takes us to this point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can kind of eliminate a lot of the </v>

202
00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 3>biological protocols that are in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

203
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 3>that caused these flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will we be left with will be these </v>

204
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 3>weird robot creatures now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the most,</v>

205
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:42.351
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>important philosophical dilemmas of the </v>

206
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:44.991
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing I just spoke about where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're evolving into some type of </v>

207
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 3>incredible intelligence is what if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>super boring,</v>

208
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

209
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And what if it's just not much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

210
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's going to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the way we're going to find out </v>

211
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.530
<v Speaker 3>how much we miss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

212
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 3>somebody you said the ridiculousness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

213
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also don't know if life can actually </v>

214
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.381
<v Speaker 3>evolve and progress just through pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>logic or pure rationality.</v>

215
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I think chance is very important in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

216
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 3>And I also think being creative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative must,</v>

217
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 3>to some extent involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ridiculousness at least must </v>

218
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.971
<v Speaker 3>involve the question of asking why now </v>
<v Speaker 3>it might get more logical and rational </v>

219
00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:23.691
<v Speaker 3>as we go forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure we're ever going to </v>

220
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.581
<v Speaker 3>completely be the perfect mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 3>model that we would want to be A.</v>

221
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure that if we had perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

222
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 3>if let's just say hypothetically we </v>
<v Speaker 3>became that perfect intelligence.</v>

223
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 3>We might purposely sabotage ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so that we always have that element</v>

224
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 3>of irrationality in our lives to keep us</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the go,</v>

225
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 3>to keep us moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep us evolving.</v>

226
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 3>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first part of that.</v>

227
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I think the second part of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking about,</v>

228
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The interesting thing that I always tell</v>

229
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I get asked this question a lot,</v>

230
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 3>is that right now our current perception</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe is pretty limited.</v>

231
00:10:56.701 --> 00:11:01.701
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ISI can only see about one percent </v>

232
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:03.981
<v Speaker 3>of the light spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our ears can hear far less than one </v>

233
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:07.101
<v Speaker 3>percent of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the sound waves and what's possible </v>

234
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:10.041
<v Speaker 3>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our actual ability to determine what </v>

235
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:13.281
<v Speaker 3>is in the universe is completely limited</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact so limited that were,</v>

236
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 3>were just basically getting tiny bits of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as we get.</v>

237
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we progress forward,</v>

238
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to have apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more applications towards getting a </v>

239
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 3>better perception and our senses of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe really entails.</v>

240
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.220
<v Speaker 3>We'll all have night vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have be able to see different </v>

241
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.511
<v Speaker 3>types of gases in the air and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have different types of feelings </v>

242
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 3>that are based in with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kind of hypersensitive and that in</v>

243
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 3>itself will give us so many new </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

244
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 3>And I try to tell this to people a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're actually going to become much</v>

245
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 3>more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think this is our world around us,</v>

246
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 3>but actually if you and I had bionic </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

247
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>we'd see that there are maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different organisms</v>

248
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 4>in this room that are also interacting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with us.</v>

249
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's gonna.</v>

250
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Maybe take us down a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either a smart or a bad path,</v>

251
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's something that could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

252
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:08.671
<v Speaker 4>that could take us to other ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other ways of experiencing the world </v>

253
00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 4>that makes it so it's not either boring </v>
<v Speaker 4>or makes it so it's not so,</v>

254
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so kinda crazy though,</v>

255
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that humans are ever gonna</v>

256
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.280
<v Speaker 4>end transhumans at least to start with </v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to give up some of the </v>

257
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.810
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous aspects of their life because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

258
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.830
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that motivates us is </v>
<v Speaker 4>fun and one of the things in,</v>

259
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 4>in human experience that is fun is being</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

260
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
<v Speaker 4>So I think you need that creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need that creative element in the </v>

261
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:36.330
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

262
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worry about the,</v>

263
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 4>just the sheer amount of data you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to process if you could see all the</v>

264
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 4>gases in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the organisms that are in the air.</v>

265
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was camping regionally in Alaska.</v>

266
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 4>We're in a Prince of Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a essentially a rainforest,</v>

267
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.290
<v Speaker 4>so it rains all day every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

268
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 4>we were in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

269
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.820
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this area where it's just constant </v>

270
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.640
<v Speaker 4>downpour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent humidity and I was in my </v>

271
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 4>tent and I turned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like little headlamp on,</v>

272
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I turn the lamp on and looked in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tent and the tent was filled with </v>

273
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.031
<v Speaker 4>moisture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like little tiny droplets of dew or </v>

274
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:18.241
<v Speaker 4>floating in the air and the entire tent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it made me think like,</v>

275
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.480
<v Speaker 4>if you could see all the microscopic </v>
<v Speaker 4>particles that are in the air </v>

276
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

277
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.840
<v Speaker 4>you're breathing in particulates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're breathing in all sorts of </v>

278
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.111
<v Speaker 4>pollutants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're breathing in farts and gases and </v>

279
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:34.111
<v Speaker 4>things from cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

280
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 4>and there's actually organisms in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

281
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's codes that are spread by people </v>

282
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.400
<v Speaker 4>coughing.</v>

283
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.120
<v Speaker 4>They cough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets in the air and those organisms </v>

284
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 4>float into your body and infect you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why we tell people,</v>

285
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:51.061
<v Speaker 4>cover your mouth when you cough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're literally spinning out life </v>

286
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 4>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then those lifeforms contaminate.</v>

287
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:56.521
<v Speaker 4>Other people are worried that that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like almost too much data to process.</v>

288
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

289
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you walk on an airplane and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see everything and you see </v>

290
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 4>people coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

291
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:03.720
<v Speaker 4>here's the virus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the virus,</v>

292
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

293
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 4>It would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be a pretty freaky experience,</v>

294
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 4>but I think the thing is we're probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that point,</v>

295
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have so much connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>either through neural implants or just </v>

296
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 4>some type of connection to machines that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

297
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Our data processing is in our brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

298
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 4>whatever kind of servers were attached </v>
<v Speaker 4>to will allow us to make sense of it </v>

299
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.751
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because right now I know you're saying </v>

300
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:30.751
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

301
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:33.091
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I could process it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life is already pretty complicated to </v>

302
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:33.510
<v Speaker 4>process when you're going through a red </v>
<v Speaker 4>light or run.</v>

303
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Someone's running a red light or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

304
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 4>But hopefully in the future we'll have </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these neuro,</v>

305
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.670
<v Speaker 4>a enhancements that will allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take that kind of stuff on and take more</v>

306
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 4>of it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

307
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

308
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.350
<v Speaker 4>there's just so much that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen when we start increasing our </v>

309
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.350
<v Speaker 4>brain power.</v>

310
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

311
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

312
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about something that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be 10,000</v>

313
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.981
<v Speaker 3>times smarter than the smartest human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being within a year to have it actually </v>

314
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>existing just through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's upgrading of a thousand times </v>

315
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 3>smarter and that's just the first year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the second or third year.</v>

316
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to know could become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

317
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>then thej curve takes off and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the singularity idea comes from.</v>

318
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're attached to that and we're able</v>

319
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 3>to keep up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're able to kind of process it.</v>

320
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.410
<v Speaker 3>all these things we start seeing are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make more sense and we'll have </v>

322
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:31.901
<v Speaker 3>so much more capacity to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now when we tried to </v>

323
00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:31.901
<v Speaker 3>imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like wow,</v>

324
00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:36.880
<v Speaker 3>way too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the future I'm hoping that our </v>

325
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 3>brains are going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 3>a thousand iphones just connected.</v>

327
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 3>And then our ability to make sense of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all and uh,</v>

328
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll,</v>

329
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

330
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I look forward to the day when I can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything will be able to see your </v>

331
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.441
<v Speaker 3>heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be able to see right through the </v>

332
00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 3>walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever people are doing in the in the </v>

333
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll hear the planes will know it,</v>

334
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 3>you know everything will will see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airwaves.</v>

335
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the movie lucy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

336
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:01.030
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts getting to that point when </v>

337
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.101
<v Speaker 3>she said she understands everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is totally interconnected to </v>

338
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:04.970
<v Speaker 3>her and she has that processing ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't overwhelm her.</v>

339
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of becomes a magical to her,</v>

340
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a some kind of saint or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of guru.</v>

341
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.720
<v Speaker 3>It just feels the entire universe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful that that's what it's going </v>

342
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 3>to be like though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really sure.</v>

343
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that may be too optimistic,</v>

344
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but I'm hopefully will be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>interconnected that will actually be </v>

345
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.451
<v Speaker 3>able to be much more part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe in terms of sensing it and </v>

346
00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 3>feeling and understanding it than we are</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

347
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.000
<v Speaker 3>That's the big concern that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>is when,</v>

348
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.470
<v Speaker 3>when folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

349
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:38.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you take the elan musk possibility </v>

350
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Speaker 3>the way he's describing it need to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying.</v>

351
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.300
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful in the mosques and the </v>

352
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.300
<v Speaker 3>demons are coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

353
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

354
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>hopefully not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that,</v>

355
00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 3>that concerns people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

356
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

357
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

358
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I always try to back away from any kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of totally qualitative or,</v>

360
00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally from statements because if I say</v>

361
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 3>anything other than it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

362
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden you're this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's pegged,</v>

363
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a definite thing and the promise,</v>

364
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:11.111
<v Speaker 3>anything we're talking about in futurist</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues is always speculation to some </v>

365
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>

366
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.680
<v Speaker 3>And no one's ever really got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

367
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people are wrong.</v>

368
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>

369
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 3>how close are you to getting it right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're at 20 percent,</v>

370
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

371
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're 70,</v>

372
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 3>80 percent wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

373
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:26.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>futures try to attempt to speculate </v>

374
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 3>based on statistical analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>historical patterns,</v>

375
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.690
<v Speaker 3>what things are gonna happen and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

376
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 3>first just throw out their ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hope that some of them stick and </v>

377
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 3>occasionally one becomes totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

378
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way the species moves.</v>

379
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I say hope,</v>

380
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not trying to pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

381
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.830
<v Speaker 3>the universe is going to be the way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it could go very wrong and it </v>

382
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 3>could turn out even better than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than I'm hopeful and it could just</v>

383
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 4>be a lot less a magical than I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

384
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.400
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some critics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some really well educated critics.</v>

385
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I was reading this piece written by this</v>
<v Speaker 4>biologist who was criticizing the whole </v>

386
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 4>idea of transhumanism and Kurzweil in </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular.</v>

387
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.650
<v Speaker 4>And what he was saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially we know so little about the </v>

388
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.981
<v Speaker 4>human mind already and we're still just </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to wrap our heads around the </v>

389
00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 4>processes that are going on that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just beginning to understand as far as,</v>

390
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>synapses,</v>

391
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 4>neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the where memories are stored,</v>

392
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200
<v Speaker 4>how to manipulate them and just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>various processes of the mind and his </v>

393
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.030
<v Speaker 4>take on it was that it's so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>unrealistic that we'll be able to </v>

394
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 4>duplicate this by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>45.</v>

395
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to 20,</v>

396
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 4>45 initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my take on that,</v>

397
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 4>when I was reading his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his piece,</v>

398
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:48.531
<v Speaker 4>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's being particularly critical</v>

399
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.900
<v Speaker 4>of it because he's.</v>

400
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.980
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that what these guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand about the human mind is that </v>

401
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 4>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

402
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 4>there's always processes that go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the scenes that were,</v>

403
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 4>we still don't have a handle on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my take on it was it,</v>

404
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 4>we don't really have to have a hand on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it if we can or handle on it.</v>

405
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:12.291
<v Speaker 4>If we can replicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they can replicate it with </v>

406
00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:15.321
<v Speaker 4>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to know how proteins are </v>

407
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.691
<v Speaker 4>processed and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>various things that create a biological </v>

408
00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 4>computer would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially what the human mind</v>

409
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:24.051
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessary if we can create </v>

410
00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:25.941
<v Speaker 4>something far superior and something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's based entirely on artificial </v>

411
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and artificial technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

412
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

413
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

414
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.470
<v Speaker 4>first of all there's a lot of critics </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there that are coming at </v>

415
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 4>transhumanist ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>futurist ideas and you just have to </v>

416
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.901
<v Speaker 4>remember that especially in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 85 percent of the people are </v>

417
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.880
<v Speaker 4>religious Christians and a lot really </v>
<v Speaker 4>that far much.</v>

418
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 4>An ABC poll told me 83 percent was out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in early 2014.</v>

419
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is?</v>

420
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 4>I have a whole bit about this in my act </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's the only idiots answer polls.</v>

421
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.020
<v Speaker 4>So you're getting 83 percent of idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever installed a pole?</v>

422
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have never answered a poll.</v>

423
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever answered a poll?</v>

424
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think most people answer polls.</v>

425
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

426
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 4>And I think 83 percent seems totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>high to me,</v>

427
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 4>but I think even if it's a lot lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just say it's 50,</v>

428
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 4>60 percent and let's just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

429
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 4>there's another 10 percent that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>various other religious ideas.</v>

430
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.670
<v Speaker 4>The problem is we've been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought up in a Judaeo Christian or an </v>

431
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:28.820
<v Speaker 4>abrahamic culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

432
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 4>we celebrate Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easter,</v>

433
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 4>these are where there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>religiosity and basically set into place</v>

434
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.980
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

435
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:41.170
<v Speaker 4>transunion is one of their most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important goals is that they want to </v>

436
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.170
<v Speaker 4>live indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that's really the,</v>

437
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 4>the center of a lot of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important goals for the next 10,</v>

438
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years is they don't want to die.</v>

439
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.950
<v Speaker 1>We want to use technology and science </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

440
00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

441
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 1>At least they at least have the choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're gonna die.</v>

442
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And if that sort of flies in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of the major,</v>

443
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the world's major religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of it is kind of based on </v>

444
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

445
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.210
<v Speaker 1>be a good person so you can get to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife and have your either seven </v>

446
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.400
<v Speaker 1>wives or whatever it is that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy two virgins,</v>

447
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that they promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm trans humanists were like,</v>

448
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this is perfect.</v>

449
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.440
<v Speaker 1>What we're here right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

450
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>this earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we'd like to do is just make it</v>

451
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:23.731
<v Speaker 1>so we don't have to leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we could stay with our families and </v>

452
00:21:23.731 --> 00:21:26.431
<v Speaker 1>we could stay with our loved ones so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could continue in our jobs or </v>

453
00:21:26.431 --> 00:21:26.431
<v Speaker 1>professions and stuff like that.</v>

454
00:21:26.431 --> 00:21:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And that really conflicts with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American point of view of,</v>

455
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

456
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.320
<v Speaker 1>how is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

457
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna Happen in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

458
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still 100 percent of people</v>

459
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 1>in Congress at least are claiming their </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious now,</v>

460
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a truly 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many are pretending,</v>

461
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.880
<v Speaker 1>but either way you still have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president that swears on the Bible to </v>

462
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 1>get his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are things that fly in the face of</v>

463
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 1>trans humanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think until that changes,</v>

464
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a huge amount of </v>

465
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:00.410
<v Speaker 1>critics out there that are saying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

466
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 1>this is a dangerous idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

467
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

468
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you can paint it a different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

469
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:06.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism is just a label.</v>

470
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just science and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All religious people want that anyways,</v>

471
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least want some of the benefits.</v>

472
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:17.070
<v Speaker 1>But I think at some point there will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a clash because when you take death out </v>

473
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 1>of the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the main philosophies,</v>

474
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:23.251
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the main ideologies of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious religious texts fall away and </v>

475
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:28.051
<v Speaker 1>they're not necessary anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's going to create a </v>

476
00:22:28.051 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty big conflict here in the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

477
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:33.301
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years as we climb to crawl to that </v>

478
00:22:33.301 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 1>spot where a lot of people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing,</v>

479
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:36.730
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may not die.</v>

480
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 1>We may live indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean for,</v>

481
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean for politics?</v>

483
00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:46.741
<v Speaker 1>Was that mean for country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is globalization and stuff like that </v>

484
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:46.741
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:46.741
<v Speaker 1>population as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

486
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:51.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a lot of </v>

487
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 1>issues with that in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where you get a lot </v>

488
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 1>of your critics from.</v>

489
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.710
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because this guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about,</v>

490
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I was not religious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biologist,</v>

491
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>he's an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of atheists that </v>

492
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.560
<v Speaker 1>have issues with the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism just as much as people who</v>

493
00:23:04.561 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>are religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's definitely something</v>

494
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:11.971
<v Speaker 1>to this idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what happens when we die </v>

495
00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's confusing.</v>

496
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It causes a lot of conflict and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of created placeholders for that.</v>

497
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:19.900
<v Speaker 1>We've created with religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've created these.</v>

498
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Whether you believe in religion or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is no one truly knows what </v>

499
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.041
<v Speaker 1>happens when we die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have faith that the religious </v>

500
00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>texts of your choose choosing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

501
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:36.270
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of scientific data is </v>

502
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that there's none when it comes to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you die.</v>

503
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.910
<v Speaker 1>There's none as far as like where did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did your soul word,</v>

504
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>your personality come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's none,</v>

505
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>there's no data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no</v>

506
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it nature?</v>

507
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Is it nurture is DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it epigenetics?</v>

508
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 4>What creates a person's personality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are you?</v>

509
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 4>What's inside of you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a soul?</v>

510
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.800
<v Speaker 4>All of it's just pure speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it consciousness trying to form some </v>

511
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 4>rational reason for your existence?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of it's speculation.</v>

512
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.370
<v Speaker 4>So I think when we start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumventing the whole reality of </v>

513
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:12.581
<v Speaker 4>biological death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going around it and coming up with </v>

514
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:12.581
<v Speaker 4>something that allows you to live </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>

515
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

516
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.540
<v Speaker 4>we might be missing the whole point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this might be a gigantic cycle of </v>

517
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 4>life and death and life and death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>continual improvement.</v>

518
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Speaker 4>And just like everything else that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>see around us,</v>

519
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:29.060
<v Speaker 4>just like our technological improvement </v>
<v Speaker 4>is constant and consistent.</v>

520
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 4>That might be the same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with life itself,</v>

521
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.560
<v Speaker 4>like with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with us stepping in and stopping this </v>

522
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 4>process with technology in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

523
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 4>we might be fucking up the whole process</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the universe.</v>

524
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 4>The other hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be.</v>

525
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole reason why we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these thoughts in the first place.</v>

526
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Mike thought of us being this </v>
<v Speaker 4>caterpillar that becomes this butterfly.</v>

527
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.620
<v Speaker 4>Our whole reason for existential angst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our whole reason for this fear of death.</v>

528
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:03.940
<v Speaker 4>These.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was six of seven,</v>

529
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.980
<v Speaker 4>seven years old and I was talking to my </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents and I was asking them,</v>

530
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:12.080
<v Speaker 4>what happens when you die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

531
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:17.081
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my stepfather said it's probably </v>

532
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:17.690
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably just,</v>

533
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 4>you probably just die and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was crying.</v>

534
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't wrap my head around it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for a seven year old,</v>

535
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 4>it's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've said this before,</v>

536
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 4>but I'll say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody likes to go to sleep,</v>

537
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 4>but nobody wants to die and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably incredibly similar,</v>

538
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.910
<v Speaker 4>but this idea of having this impending </v>
<v Speaker 4>end to this experience,</v>

539
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 4>it might be one of the motivating </v>
<v Speaker 4>factors for us to create this artificial</v>

540
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to create this artificial intelligence.</v>

541
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.240
<v Speaker 4>This thing that we have that freaks us </v>
<v Speaker 4>out worrying about death might be part </v>

542
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 4>of the motivation for us to transition </v>
<v Speaker 4>into something new.</v>

543
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

544
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 4>In fact I totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

545
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.470
<v Speaker 4>my entire book is really based on a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>singular moment when the main character </v>

546
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.550
<v Speaker 4>basically almost dies and he realizes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that point forward,</v>

547
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 4>and that's what the transfer is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A novel.</v>

548
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a novel,</v>

549
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:18.221
<v Speaker 4>but that's exactly what you've said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the transhumanist wager is once you </v>

550
00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 4>realize that you could die and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially as a seven year old child,</v>

551
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You into something you can do about it.</v>

552
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:29.411
<v Speaker 4>Especially in the 21st century where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have so much science and so much </v>

553
00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:32.651
<v Speaker 4>technology at our disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you make this kind of wager where </v>

554
00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:32.651
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

555
00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:37.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually going to dedicate my life </v>
<v Speaker 4>to try and accomplish that because I </v>

556
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:41.261
<v Speaker 4>don't like it that I have to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's essentially what the </v>

557
00:26:41.261 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 4>transhumanist wager it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think the interesting thing</v>

558
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 3>is that philosophical conundrum of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

559
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:51.591
<v Speaker 3>if we take death out of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is life as valuable as it is or are we </v>

560
00:26:51.591 --> 00:26:55.401
<v Speaker 3>messing with the mechanism of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>and are we mixing with the mechanism of </v>

561
00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 3>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

562
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of whatever the universe is going into.</v>

563
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.050
<v Speaker 3>And I intend to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

564
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've said before,</v>

565
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.220
<v Speaker 3>I want to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to live indefinitely,</v>

566
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not necessarily wanting to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>it so that that's a kind of permanent.</v>

567
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I just want the choice and that's what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is most important.</v>

568
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

569
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 3>people in the transgender community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've actually been shying away from the</v>

570
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 3>use of the word immortality anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've realized that a lot.</v>

571
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just kind of scares people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really think we mean in mortality </v>

572
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.090
<v Speaker 3>and we don't necessarily what we mean is</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just want a choice on when and how </v>

573
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 3>we're going to live and if we're ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to die,</v>

574
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 3>it's under our circumstances.</v>

575
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on our terms and um,</v>

576
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use indefinite lifespans,</v>

577
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more because at least lets me say </v>

578
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>when I might want to end my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if ever.</v>

579
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 3>And I actually wonder too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

580
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to live indefinitely,</v>

581
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.060
<v Speaker 3>would god potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone was God,</v>

582
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:54.860
<v Speaker 3>would God maybe committed suicide some </v>
<v Speaker 3>point because it's just an idea.</v>

583
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

584
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 3>if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were God and you had all power,</v>

585
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 3>is that something that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you wanted?</v>

586
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm revealing like plots in my sql.</v>

587
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:10.491
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is maybe an omnipotent entity </v>

588
00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 3>would say to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create a cycle of renewal.</v>

589
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I will end my existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will commit suicide.</v>

590
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the whole system perhaps </v>

591
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Speaker 3>restarts itself as we had talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

592
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.141
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you create parameters in your </v>

593
00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:27.141
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>

594
00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:27.141
<v Speaker 3>So that all of a sudden you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

595
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 3>there is renewal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is creativity and it's out of your</v>

596
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you have to,</v>

597
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 3>I know that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day traders,</v>

599
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 3>when they're playing stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

600
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:42.291
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them have such problems that </v>

601
00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:42.291
<v Speaker 3>they'll purposely set their codes so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't get into their account,</v>

602
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but they won't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just type it in,</v>

603
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 3>type it in short term memory and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it and the way they do this so they</v>

604
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:52.971
<v Speaker 3>can't trade anymore if they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing money and they having a bad day </v>

605
00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Friends of mine were doing it in college</v>

606
00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.350
<v Speaker 3>and I sometimes wonder if maybe a grand </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual entity would do the same </v>

607
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would program into his own existence,</v>

608
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.730
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues as we had talked about,</v>

609
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.800
<v Speaker 3>ridiculousness of life because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that keeps us moving forward </v>

610
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 3>and maybe God would even programming </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing himself or herself or itself,</v>

611
00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:14.880
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

612
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

613
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.800
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a heady concept.</v>

614
00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:23.801
<v Speaker 4>And Iowa have always wondered why it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it seems like we need conflict in </v>

615
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:28.271
<v Speaker 4>order to find resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I think if everybody lived in </v>

616
00:29:28.271 --> 00:29:31.160
<v Speaker 4>this perfect state of bliss and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>Utopian existence,</v>

617
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 4>we probably never get anything done and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why we get things </v>

618
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.500
<v Speaker 4>done is because we're constantly worried</v>
<v Speaker 4>about overcoming struggle.</v>

619
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 4>We're constantly worried about </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcoming potential aggressors or you </v>

620
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:49.801
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that could go wrong and </v>

621
00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 4>overcoming environmental issues that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've created and so we're.</v>

622
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 4>We're coming up with technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>solutions for those things,</v>

623
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.720
<v Speaker 4>for every new power source we come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

624
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.740
<v Speaker 4>whether it's nuclear or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always some sort of a byproduct </v>

625
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.881
<v Speaker 4>of that that we have to deal with and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an effect that it's having </v>

626
00:30:05.881 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 4>on the environment that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitigate and it seems that this constant</v>

627
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Yin and Yang is sort of built into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe to stay.</v>

628
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 4>I was telling you about my trip that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had in Alaska where I was camping in the</v>

629
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:20.380
<v Speaker 4>rain was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was wet and cold.</v>

630
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 4>It was miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I came back to La,</v>

631
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:27.751
<v Speaker 4>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called my friend Steve who took me on </v>

632
00:30:27.751 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 4>the trip and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I have never felt better?</v>

633
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I feel fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the sun feels good.</v>

634
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:39.150
<v Speaker 4>It just feels good to be driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good to be able to go to a </v>

635
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:39.150
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

636
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.620
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things about life that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so amazing that I don't necessarily </v>

637
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 4>completely appreciate until I go like </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the wilderness.</v>

638
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 4>When you go into the wilderness and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come back,</v>

639
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:55.201
<v Speaker 4>you can really appreciate the city and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like these built in struggles,</v>

640
00:30:55.361 --> 00:31:00.361
<v Speaker 4>this Yin and Yang of life is why we </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate things like you don't </v>

641
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 4>appreciate really cool people unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're around a bunch of assholes.</v>

642
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.140
<v Speaker 4>You know you don't appreciate funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>people unless you're around people that </v>

643
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.111
<v Speaker 4>have zero sense of humor and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>around funny people and they just feel </v>

644
00:31:13.111 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Speaker 4>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They warm you up.</v>

645
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 4>It just feels fun and I really wonder if</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

646
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think of it as just life.</v>

647
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540
<v Speaker 4>These are just the realities of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unfortunate realities of life and </v>

648
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 4>one day we're going to get our shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and we won't have all those bad</v>

649
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 4>aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is,</v>

650
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 4>is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

651
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 4>or is this like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it all just data?</v>

652
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Is it all just a part of the code?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it all just a part of the algorithm </v>

653
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.401
<v Speaker 4>that moves whatever we're doing forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that in that sense you need </v>

654
00:31:41.401 --> 00:31:46.171
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built into the system in order to </v>

655
00:31:46.171 --> 00:31:49.381
<v Speaker 4>create entropy in order to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement in order to keep everything </v>

656
00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 4>going so that we eventually make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cocoon and become that </v>

657
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 4>butterfly.</v>

658
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

659
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:59.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean the conflict question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is such an age old philosophical </v>

660
00:31:59.371 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 4>question because it's like you're always</v>
<v Speaker 4>striving for perfection,</v>

661
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 4>but when you actually think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfection in itself,</v>

662
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound like the thing you </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually might want really wanted was </v>

663
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.120
<v Speaker 4>the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

664
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.020
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I think they say,</v>

665
00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>journey is,</v>

666
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the or half the fund at least.</v>

667
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

668
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

669
00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:20.350
<v Speaker 4>as far as like from a transhumanist </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective since we're,</v>

670
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 4>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think miniscule in terms of what we</v>

671
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:28.930
<v Speaker 4>are as entities right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know our brain power is a whatever,</v>

672
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 4>a billion neurons or how many however </v>
<v Speaker 4>many billion there are.</v>

673
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:38.071
<v Speaker 4>But the idea is we could create an earth</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's full of servers</v>

674
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.440
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or as I like to say in my,</v>

675
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

676
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 3>in some of my writings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:49.121
<v Speaker 3>the empire state building could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>filled with servers and that would not </v>

678
00:32:49.121 --> 00:32:49.121
<v Speaker 3>mean like waiters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

679
00:32:49.121 --> 00:32:50.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

680
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:50.990
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 3>basically computer chips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>servers,</v>

682
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:57.911
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is we could create </v>

683
00:32:57.911 --> 00:33:00.671
<v Speaker 3>something far more complex than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human brain and if we're tapped into </v>

684
00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:04.481
<v Speaker 3>that and now we can get into something </v>
<v Speaker 3>more like the death star even that's </v>

685
00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:04.481
<v Speaker 3>just filled with computer chips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>servers,</v>

686
00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we get to something that huge,</v>

687
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 3>our intelligence could be millions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of times more what it is now.</v>

688
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if that happens,</v>

689
00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:15.380
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea that types of conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would come from that.</v>

690
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the conflicts are also a million </v>

691
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.771
<v Speaker 3>times greater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe conflict is something that you </v>

692
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:26.531
<v Speaker 3>always go through and maybe you even get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the end of some perfect entity and </v>

693
00:33:26.531 --> 00:33:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you actually can't get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

694
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you get stopped by some kind of </v>

695
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 3>physical thing that could happen.</v>

696
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

697
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.631
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome to think about it because </v>

698
00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is from a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

699
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 3>currently I can't see a world without </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>

700
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

701
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would almost be like the world didn't</v>

702
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:48.641
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes it exist to us is that we </v>

703
00:33:48.641 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 3>have all these trials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have all these tribulations and these</v>

704
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:52.610
<v Speaker 3>things happened to us and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're happy and sad because of it and we</v>

705
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 3>feel it because then we grow from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

706
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for me to even understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

707
00:33:57.501 --> 00:34:02.501
<v Speaker 3>but I think as we get more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as we're able to tap our brains </v>

708
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 3>into mega giant machines and increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>our intelligence,</v>

709
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 3>it will probably become that much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>

710
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 3>And I think the conflicts will also </v>
<v Speaker 3>become much more complex.</v>

711
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm not really worried about a </v>

712
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the near term,</v>

713
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.621
<v Speaker 3>at least in the next hundred years to </v>
<v Speaker 3>300 years without any conflict because </v>

714
00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>the universe is still so big.</v>

715
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.060
<v Speaker 3>There's all this types of exploration in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

716
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 3>We have to figure out exactly what pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy is,</v>

717
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.470
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

718
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 3>will trans human entities eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>transitioned into something like that?</v>

719
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to subatomic things and whatnot.</v>

720
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And there's so much to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it could get a,</v>

721
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll probably find that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more to explore than we ever thought and</v>

722
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 3>will probably be just as lost in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and stuck in conflict as we are</v>

723
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:46.940
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps even more so as we,</v>

724
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:51.941
<v Speaker 3>as we grow more intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if we do create this </v>

725
00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:55.211
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably credibly complex system of </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers that run everything.</v>

726
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:02.681
<v Speaker 3>We've eliminated emotions and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>carved out this Utopian existence.</v>

727
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 3>They're still asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still super volcanoes.</v>

728
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.590
<v Speaker 3>It's still hurricanes and tsunamis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes and all sorts of things that</v>

729
00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even on the remote horizon.</v>

730
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 3>US controlling natural disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even in,</v>

731
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even for a fraction of the natural </v>

732
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 3>disasters that that potentially can come</v>
<v Speaker 3>our way.</v>

733
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were not even considering how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to control super volcanoes.</v>

734
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:37.901
<v Speaker 3>There's no technology so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing they can do and I was </v>

735
00:35:37.901 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>reading</v>

736
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got on this trip one night I'll do </v>

737
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 4>this and just really fucked my head up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I.</v>

738
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I hate doing it right before I go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bed,</v>

739
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 4>but I got on this trip one night about </v>
<v Speaker 4>super volcanoes can.</v>

740
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:53.181
<v Speaker 4>I started reading all the super </v>
<v Speaker 4>volcanoes that exists currently and the </v>

741
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:58.190
<v Speaker 4>reality of what has happened when those </v>
<v Speaker 4>have gone off and there's one in </v>

742
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.971
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia that they believe there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that have pointed to as </v>

743
00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:06.081
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of why all humans can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>traced back to original ancestors.</v>

744
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 4>That they think that this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that blue somewhere.</v>

745
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:14.271
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was like 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus years ago that they think that when</v>

746
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:20.481
<v Speaker 4>this fucker went off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it killed most of the people on the </v>

747
00:36:20.481 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an Indonesia incident,</v>

748
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 4>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger than yellowstone,</v>

749
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:27.950
<v Speaker 4>and they think that the remaining few </v>
<v Speaker 4>people repopulated the earth and that </v>

750
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 4>the seven plus billion people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly related to a 70,000</v>

751
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

752
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.390
<v Speaker 4>The survivors of this super volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy and that's terrifying.</v>

753
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.670
<v Speaker 4>And if that happens again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a damn thing we could do </v>

754
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.271
<v Speaker 4>about it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're constantly worrying about getting </v>

755
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:50.121
<v Speaker 4>faster Wifi and make it an electric car </v>
<v Speaker 4>that go more than 300 miles without a </v>

756
00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:55.011
<v Speaker 4>recharge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reality of natural disasters is </v>

757
00:36:55.011 --> 00:36:58.641
<v Speaker 4>there's always that nature reset button </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that nature reset button could come </v>

758
00:36:58.641 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 4>in the form of a five mile wide rock </v>
<v Speaker 4>that slammed into the Yucatan and killed</v>

759
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:07.851
<v Speaker 4>all the dinosaurs or that gigantic super</v>
<v Speaker 4>volcano in Indonesia that killed off who</v>

760
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:14.271
<v Speaker 4>knows what percentage of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they think it could be as much as </v>

761
00:37:14.271 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 4>like killed off everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for a thousand people,</v>

762
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 4>that's a real possibility that's being </v>
<v Speaker 4>bandied about.</v>

763
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to stop.</v>

764
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:24.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

765
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.390
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

766
00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

767
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.020
<v Speaker 3>about two months ago created a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transhumanist party,</v>

768
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.260
<v Speaker 3>which is the kind of first political </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization about it and the third we </v>

769
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.800
<v Speaker 3>had three main goals and the first is </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make it so that everyone can live</v>

770
00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second one is just a spread,</v>

771
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:47.260
<v Speaker 3>a kind of a general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we want people to think positively </v>

772
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.020
<v Speaker 3>when they think of technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science set of being so critical.</v>

773
00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:53.021
<v Speaker 3>But the third one deals with existential</v>
<v Speaker 3>risks and it amazes me that we spend so </v>

774
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:58.331
<v Speaker 3>much money at a walmart or Mcdonald's or</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to Disney land when we have </v>

775
00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:01.820
<v Speaker 3>problems like a super volcano that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

776
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Things that if you think about at late </v>
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

777
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.950
<v Speaker 3>it keeps you up because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific.</v>

778
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.680
<v Speaker 3>And what's amazing about is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just super,</v>

779
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:10.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

780
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.700
<v Speaker 3>we've had existential risks facing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet for,</v>

781
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've happened,</v>

782
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.950
<v Speaker 3>we know they've happened.</v>

783
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.300
<v Speaker 3>We can see that they've happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And still we send such a small amount of</v>

784
00:38:20.301 --> 00:38:23.600
<v Speaker 3>government budgets towards protecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the species as a whole.</v>

785
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Speaker 3>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think from an existential risk</v>

786
00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:31.841
<v Speaker 3>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be the first thing you would </v>

787
00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:31.841
<v Speaker 3>probably tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

788
00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I actually thought this sort of with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ebola,</v>

789
00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

790
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that we don't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000</v>

791
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and wipe it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we just as a,</v>

792
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:40.030
<v Speaker 3>as a world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get together and do it.</v>

793
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:41.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

794
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.870
<v Speaker 3>we're worth 200 to 400 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say the,</v>

795
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.850
<v Speaker 3>the world and it would probably take 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or 100 million to,</v>

796
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 3>to wipe out the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we do it?</v>

797
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we wipe out malaria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we map out the things?</v>

798
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Is it really that simple though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not that simple,</v>

799
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 3>but no one's tackled it in with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than a fraction of that amount.</v>

800
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.900
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you actually put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world's best scientists together and </v>

801
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:03.900
<v Speaker 3>really said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

802
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 3>some things really are scary for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human race.</v>

803
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.160
<v Speaker 3>This is something that we need to go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and attack first before it gets </v>

804
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 3>out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

805
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it always so strange that </v>

806
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.420
<v Speaker 3>governments don't treat this seriously </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's because as a politician</v>

807
00:39:19.421 --> 00:39:24.421
<v Speaker 3>you can't because it sounds so far </v>
<v Speaker 3>fetched to talk about a five mile wide </v>

808
00:39:24.421 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 3>asteroid hitting the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like.</v>

809
00:39:25.961 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

810
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:31.351
<v Speaker 3>I'll worry about that tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is as soon as something </v>

811
00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 3>like that happens or a title wave </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

812
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in kills so many people,</v>

813
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few years back,</v>

814
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:41.220
<v Speaker 3>then you start thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it always takes like some kind </v>

815
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 3>of giant cataclysmic disaster to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually get people to say,</v>

816
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:48.150
<v Speaker 3>today I'm putting my money where my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth is and we're going to actually go </v>

817
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.150
<v Speaker 3>out and try to stop some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

818
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.070
<v Speaker 3>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was super volcanoes.</v>

819
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly with asteroids and stuff </v>

820
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some things that we can do.</v>

821
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:56.010
<v Speaker 3>And certainly with diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

822
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>there are things we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

823
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:05.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm always bummed out because I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like our governments don't treat the </v>

825
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 3>risk to the species seriously enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They treat,</v>

826
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social security,</v>

827
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:12.210
<v Speaker 3>tax issues and this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 3>it covers the headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's really important for the </v>

829
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all seven,</v>

830
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.510
<v Speaker 3>almost 8 billion of us soon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

831
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 3>is making sure that we don't all go the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of the dinosaurs and that just takes</v>

832
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:24.740
<v Speaker 3>a matter of money and putting some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best minds to insane.</v>

833
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is that you guys and girls </v>

834
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:29.760
<v Speaker 3>need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just please do it.</v>

835
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 3>The malaria one is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to radio lab.</v>

836
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:35.380
<v Speaker 3>You have to listen to that podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

837
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:37.300
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a brilliant,</v>

838
00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 3>brilliant podcast that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

839
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's put out by NPR.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those are the folks who do it,</v>

840
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.540
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

841
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.760
<v Speaker 3>they had an episode where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about mosquitoes and they were </v>

842
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.361
<v Speaker 3>talking about malaria and they said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of the people that have died ever </v>

843
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:53.890
<v Speaker 3>since people have been around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were killed by malaria.</v>

844
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.200
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had malaria and malaria.</v>

845
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I've had a whole bunch of God when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

846
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I did this a long sail trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

847
00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:04.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a result,</v>

848
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I got a whole bunch of stuff like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hepatitis,</v>

849
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:12.010
<v Speaker 3>a dandy fever and malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang fever and malaria.</v>

850
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I had it all at various places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I spent about four months in the </v>

851
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Solomon Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

852
00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:22.381
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also kind of went through the </v>

853
00:41:22.381 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>North Pacific Ocean after the South </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacific and basically on a sailboat,</v>

854
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get it unless you're </v>

855
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.611
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was even taking prophylactic a </v>

856
00:41:29.611 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>malaria pills when I got malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

857
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:31.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

858
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't always work.</v>

859
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>There's more than chloroquine that</v>

860
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You needed math,</v>

861
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:40.061
<v Speaker 1>mcqueen and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is they gave me crazy </v>

862
00:41:40.061 --> 00:41:41.100
<v Speaker 1>nightmares so I didn't take the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophylactics,</v>

863
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but I eventually got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went and tested there,</v>

864
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>and then just sat on my boat for three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four days.</v>

865
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And then I did a methlick when treatment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for malaria,</v>

866
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take four tablets times three days.</v>

867
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:55.691
<v Speaker 1>So you take 12 altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if you know anything </v>

868
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:55.691
<v Speaker 1>about Larry or mefloquine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you an,</v>

869
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it makes you hypersensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at a sunset,</v>

870
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 1>you get incredibly emotional and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a great thing to write poetry on,</v>

871
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but it totally messes with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why a lot of people,</v>

872
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:06.730
<v Speaker 1>at least when I was sailing 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

873
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.570
<v Speaker 1>tried not to take it as a prophylactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

874
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 1>so it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of it.</v>

875
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an able body 22 year old person.</v>

876
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So you're pretty much able to go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things.</v>

877
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been around a number of villages </v>

878
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.561
<v Speaker 1>in that trip where people have died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children die all the time and I still,</v>

879
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a 715 million people </v>

880
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe are still dying from malaria a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year or have died in the last.</v>

881
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

882
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about it,</v>

883
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

884
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just go out there?</v>

885
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is why Bill Gates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted.</v>

886
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 1>This is one of his main initiatives with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

887
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 1>his incredible wealth is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

888
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:51.281
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one thing we could literally </v>

889
00:42:51.281 --> 00:42:53.260
<v Speaker 1>just take out 627,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria deaths this year.</v>

890
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

891
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

892
00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:58.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge amount when you think about </v>

894
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:03.240
<v Speaker 1>in terms of it's far more than war.</v>

895
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far more than anything else.</v>

896
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 1>And think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we spent all this money on war.</v>

897
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 1>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.350
<v Speaker 1>take a little bit of that budget and pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

899
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 1>UNICEF has a different number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say over a million.</v>

900
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 1>UNICEF says over a million people die of</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria every year.</v>

901
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many.</v>

902
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:28.090
<v Speaker 1>It causes 300 to $500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million infections and over a million </v>

903
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is John Hopkins also says that.</v>

904
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming it's probably somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a million.</v>

905
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>impoverished countries,</v>

906
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to keep track of how</v>

907
00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:40.970
<v Speaker 1>many people know too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of the people were.</v>

908
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

909
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>there was no telephone in this village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no anything,</v>

910
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I was just anchored off there at a surf </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot and um,</v>

911
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and I must have gotten it through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that I was sailing through some of </v>

912
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:53.740
<v Speaker 1>these outer islands.</v>

913
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's uh,</v>

914
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe once a week there's a boat that </v>

915
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.851
<v Speaker 1>comes through with supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why people die from it </v>

916
00:44:00.851 --> 00:44:03.641
<v Speaker 1>because there's really nothing there </v>
<v Speaker 1>except the basic drugs to take care of </v>

917
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 1>it and it doesn't always work and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

918
00:44:06.051 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And there's variations of it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

919
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So some people try to just ride it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not take the drugs because they make</v>

920
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you so wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well some people actually,</v>

921
00:44:13.641 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 1>once they get it are too weak to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the clinic.</v>

922
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So like in the Solomon Islands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

923
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just filled with these giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant mountains,</v>

924
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of hills and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to Kinda cross ravines.</v>

925
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was so out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could barely even get up.</v>

926
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:32.801
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just could drink water and I kind of </v>

927
00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:32.801
<v Speaker 1>laid in my bed all day.</v>

928
00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have it and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>

929
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you either have to send your kids to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

930
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going be able to climb a </v>

931
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 1>couple miles to go get the medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you live in some outer tribe,</v>

932
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.740
<v Speaker 1>away from a clinic and most assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

933
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred islands in the Solomon </v>

934
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has access to the same thing with</v>

935
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a huge amount of tribes,</v>

936
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:57.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually try to get anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all highlands full of snakes and </v>

937
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:02.810
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even across a mile and that kind of </v>

938
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.211
<v Speaker 1>territory is pretty tough stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have to go 20 miles to get </v>

939
00:45:05.211 --> 00:45:06.150
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might just be safer to take your bat,</v>

940
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.360
<v Speaker 1>not use all your energy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to ride it out so your immune </v>

941
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 1>system is capable of your healthy young </v>
<v Speaker 1>22 year old of surviving.</v>

942
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I think it's just luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

943
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I was already on a chloric when at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

944
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>so I already had some resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain type of,</v>

945
00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

946
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 1>malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I see.</v>

947
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 1>But once I had tested for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got basically got feverish and</v>

948
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 1>all this and I went and tested before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was got really bad and they said,</v>

949
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like you have it at this little</v>

950
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 1>clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

951
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:40.581
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was too far away to sail to </v>

952
00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:40.581
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

953
00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:43.740
<v Speaker 1>at the time I didn't have any real </v>
<v Speaker 1>services to be air evacuated out.</v>

954
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I had been sailing three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years already.</v>

956
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't leave your trip.</v>

957
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:53.451
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole bunch of incidences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't leave your boat every time </v>

958
00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:53.451
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong you just got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it.</v>

959
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And so I just went back and took this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lithium treatment and so I,</v>

960
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I had the cure for it.</v>

961
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:03.590
<v Speaker 1>And the cure is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the Solomon Islands at the </v>

962
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.111
<v Speaker 1>time was you take this regimen of </v>
<v Speaker 1>laurium 12 tablets over three days and </v>

963
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 1>that should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should take care of it.</v>

964
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.210
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy trip you went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

965
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

966
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 1>you sail for three or four years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>

967
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I sail for around seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was a left from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

969
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.770
<v Speaker 1>from Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara or Los Angeles and went </v>

970
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.811
<v Speaker 1>through the South Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent four years there and continue to </v>

971
00:46:23.811 --> 00:46:24.400
<v Speaker 1>end across the Indian Ocean and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

972
00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>a Mediterranean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've done some crazy stuff.</v>

973
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:32.901
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that stuff was when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for the National Geographic </v>

974
00:46:32.901 --> 00:46:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was kind of set up where I would go</v>

975
00:46:33.961 --> 00:46:38.961
<v Speaker 1>and do short three to five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of filler documentaries in </v>

976
00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 1>between the longer segments of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that they had.</v>

977
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd stop places and film and um,</v>

978
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'd create these three to five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute news pieces.</v>

979
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's really fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did some crazy,</v>

980
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fun stories,</v>

981
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.210
<v Speaker 1>a weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

983
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:59.211
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that would be an insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>life of adventure all those years on a </v>

984
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>sailboat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sail it around.</v>

985
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

986
00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and in the South Pacific as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

987
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the South Pacific was the best part </v>

988
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

989
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't working at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was later that I started actually </v>

990
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.950
<v Speaker 1>working and doing the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic stuff.</v>

991
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was great too,</v>

992
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but the South Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just there with about 500 bucks.</v>

993
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I spent literally four years in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Pacific,</v>

994
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 1>including the time I was at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Solomons.</v>

995
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:27.531
<v Speaker 1>The Solomons is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts getting into the North Pacific </v>

996
00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:27.531
<v Speaker 1>and A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

997
00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 1>what a wonderful time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 21,</v>

998
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:33.231
<v Speaker 1>just finished school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sailing around and a half reading </v>

999
00:47:33.231 --> 00:47:33.231
<v Speaker 1>books on the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:47:33.231 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times I had girlfriends come</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me for a month or two.</v>

1001
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a surfer and I was a paraglider </v>

1002
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would do just all sorts of </v>

1003
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.230
<v Speaker 1>activities all the time and spear </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

1004
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I was what a lie was hard to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like I have kids now and </v>

1005
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm married and house and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm probably can never go back to the</v>

1006
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:58.981
<v Speaker 1>days of youth I wandering around in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific sailing going by the wind.</v>

1007
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious.</v>

1008
00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>

1009
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:10.321
<v Speaker 1>those were the days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the opposite of </v>

1010
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:10.321
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1011
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:10.321
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1012
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1013
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and I was very low tech at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:16.800
<v Speaker 1>when I first started sailing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even have gps.</v>

1015
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.950
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used a sextant for the first few </v>

1016
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:23.521
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use one of those crazy Christopher </v>

1017
00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:23.521
<v Speaker 1>Columbus thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they had.</v>

1018
00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Only the military had access to the GPS </v>
<v Speaker 1>system then.</v>

1019
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 1>So no one private people weren't allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to travel yet.</v>

1020
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I had a GPS system on my phone or my car</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was cd rom driven and it was in,</v>

1021
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to say the early two thousands or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even the late nineties,</v>

1022
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it was somewhere around 2000 ish and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got one of the first ones and it was </v>

1023
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:53.341
<v Speaker 1>such an inaccurate piece of shit and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really slow and it was only good for</v>

1024
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a stick.</v>

1025
00:48:55.901 --> 00:49:00.570
<v Speaker 1>The CD in there was a slot that it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into it.</v>

1026
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to imagine a world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>gps didn't exist.</v>

1027
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone be on a boat traveling around </v>

1028
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 1>the world on this boat with no gps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>

1029
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:14.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1030
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really.</v>

1031
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

1032
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.760
<v Speaker 1>And the sex thing is so awesome because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually use the stars to navigate </v>

1033
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.560
<v Speaker 1>same stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We teach kids to my daughters.</v>

1034
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll point out and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 1>and the whole life was so magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1036
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:29.680
<v Speaker 1>it's still cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what I'm doing now.</v>

1037
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:34.681
<v Speaker 1>But there was something much more a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human and a just youthful about that </v>

1038
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 1>entire period of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human.</v>

1039
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a strange word that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>used?</v>

1040
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your whole thing is </v>

1041
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism and you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly low tech adventure as </v>

1042
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 1>being one of the highlights of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1043
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you exactly how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>switched.</v>

1044
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.160
<v Speaker 1>After most of the sail trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually covering a story in </v>

1045
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam for nationals for the National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Geographic Channel.</v>

1046
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 1>We were covering a story on bomb </v>
<v Speaker 1>diggers.</v>

1047
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they do is,</v>

1048
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and there's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think five to 15,</v>

1049
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 1>10 percent.</v>

1050
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least five percent of the </v>

1051
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.440
<v Speaker 1>American bombs dropped by America in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam never exploded.</v>

1052
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So what you have is you have millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of metal lying around the jungles </v>

1053
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.250
<v Speaker 1>just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth is all around them,</v>

1054
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 1>and in most of the rice farmers market </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a dollar a day.</v>

1055
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 1>So ultimately what's happened is a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>community of farmers have said,</v>

1056
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we salvage the metal,</v>

1057
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:39.521
<v Speaker 1>sell the metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will make 10 times what we would </v>

1058
00:50:39.521 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 1>make in a season in farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that the DMZ,</v>

1059
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:46.811
<v Speaker 1>the demilitarized zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit of parts of Vietnam are </v>

1060
00:50:46.811 --> 00:50:48.070
<v Speaker 1>filled with landmines and dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these unexploded bomb.</v>

1061
00:50:48.071 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Some them that as long as this table are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about pretty close to it,</v>

1062
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are incredibly dangerous because you </v>

1063
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:56.840
<v Speaker 1>have to dismantle it and take the metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a dealer in the city and whatnot.</v>

1064
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.380
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the bomb hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call themselves,</v>

1065
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and there might be 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them in Vietnam,</v>

1066
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up losing their lives,</v>

1067
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 1>are losing their legs on landmines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to cover the story because</v>

1068
00:51:08.241 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally fascinating.</v>

1069
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1070
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I had a very close incident on one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>final days when I was,</v>

1071
00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:20.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm covering the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameron hand is my guide came from </v>

1072
00:51:20.501 --> 00:51:24.611
<v Speaker 1>behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were walking on a trail guide came </v>

1073
00:51:24.611 --> 00:51:26.831
<v Speaker 1>from behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stepped off the trail to look at an </v>

1074
00:51:26.831 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 1>impression because the way you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>where these unexploded bombs came,</v>

1075
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 1>is that a part of the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an impression in the,</v>

1076
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:35.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the earth and that he came and </v>

1077
00:51:35.921 --> 00:51:35.921
<v Speaker 1>tackled me and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1078
00:51:35.921 --> 00:51:35.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding my camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.090
<v Speaker 1>so we all went down and then he pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1080
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look right here.</v>

1081
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:44.270
<v Speaker 1>And in the ground there was this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>little silver thing and a little black </v>

1082
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.430
<v Speaker 1>thing actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1083
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 1>we probably a landmine and you almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped on it.</v>

1084
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1085
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I just kinda sat there and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1086
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a little too freaky for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I had already,</v>

1087
00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:56.300
<v Speaker 1>like in the years proceeding this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd had a,</v>

1088
00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:00.320
<v Speaker 1>all my diseases on the sailboat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been to a number of war zones.</v>

1089
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1090
00:52:01.241 --> 00:52:05.840
<v Speaker 1>about a year earlier had a huge kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of incidents in the cashmere,</v>

1091
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 1>a Indian Pakistan conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I covered.</v>

1092
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I did a humanitarian kind of war peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1093
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.470
<v Speaker 1>and I was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1094
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landmine incident was the one that </v>

1095
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.461
<v Speaker 1>sort of in my brain said human to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhuman and I thought I'm not doing </v>

1096
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually went home after the incident.</v>

1097
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some,</v>

1098
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.680
<v Speaker 1>there was a shook you up that much.</v>

1099
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It was like a philosophical bomb went </v>
<v Speaker 1>off in my head and I said,</v>

1100
00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1101
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm 28 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing crazy things for huge </v>

1102
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.320
<v Speaker 1>amounts of time and getting very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1103
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I was working at a nonprofit </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

1104
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:43.931
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia called wildaid and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing undercover work to busting </v>

1105
00:52:43.931 --> 00:52:43.931
<v Speaker 1>poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
00:52:43.931 --> 00:52:45.040
<v Speaker 1>we were literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1107
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd go with a team of militia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1108
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:52.560
<v Speaker 1>we were a nonprofit and we'd go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and free live animals that had </v>

1109
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.400
<v Speaker 1>been confiscated for food and we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1110
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:59.530
<v Speaker 1>literally arrest the poachers because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have China and Cambodia have this </v>

1111
00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 1>illegal poaching system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

1112
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>it was like I had just come from about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month of doing that and it was like a </v>

1113
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>little bit too much for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>

1114
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much hecticness.</v>

1115
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>So the landmine incident was the one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind that changed it.</v>

1116
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And I said I went home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I essentially began working </v>

1117
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 1>on the book and I'm the transcripts </v>
<v Speaker 1>wager,</v>

1118
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.910
<v Speaker 1>which has sort of launched me into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1119
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>this public career of promoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism.</v>

1120
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:27.521
<v Speaker 1>I'd always been a transhumanist as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone wants to use technology and </v>

1121
00:53:27.521 --> 00:53:31.551
<v Speaker 1>science to upgrade myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was the time that I made it </v>

1122
00:53:31.551 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the time that I said,</v>

1123
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1124
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm done having fun and just writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalistic stories.</v>

1125
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm now going to actually dedicate my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to something that means a lot to me</v>

1126
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to ever have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing death.</v>

1127
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 1>The landmines certainly would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed me,</v>

1128
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least made me to such a.</v>

1129
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 1>You almost always lose legs and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little too much for me.</v>

1130
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:57.531
<v Speaker 1>So I came back and that's sort of how my</v>
<v Speaker 1>career of the church trajectory of </v>

1131
00:53:57.531 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism for me took onto this </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite public</v>

1132
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.090
<v Speaker 4>roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1133
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

1134
00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.600
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's incredibly terrifying to think that</v>

1135
00:54:08.601 --> 00:54:11.810
<v Speaker 4>there's that many landmines still in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam.</v>

1136
00:54:11.811 --> 00:54:14.840
<v Speaker 4>I've read that before and I kind of put </v>
<v Speaker 4>it aside,</v>

1137
00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I guess in the back of my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those poor people that lived there,</v>

1138
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:22.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Vietnam War is just such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably fucked up time in history,</v>

1139
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:28.150
<v Speaker 4>but it's so incredible how peaceful the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vietnamese are and how forgiving and </v>

1140
00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:34.100
<v Speaker 4>accepting the Vietnamese people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>about us invading or oh,</v>

1141
00:54:34.101 --> 00:54:35.450
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1142
00:54:35.451 --> 00:54:40.451
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the troops of the 19 sixties and </v>

1143
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:41.900
<v Speaker 4>seventies invading Vietnam and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific things that happened there.</v>

1144
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:47.470
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fact that no one's freaking </v>

1145
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:50.321
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's that many bombs that just </v>

1146
00:54:50.321 --> 00:54:50.321
<v Speaker 4>occasionally go off and kill some poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>farmer.</v>

1147
00:54:50.321 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think America should go in there and </v>

1148
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 1>clean it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1149
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 1>because it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of bombs that are.</v>

1150
00:54:55.891 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 1>There are such a staggering number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could never cleared up with 10,000</v>

1151
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese farmers who have given up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fields,</v>

1152
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1153
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's happening all over the country now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Cambodia and Laos bomb diggers are,</v>

1154
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an entire culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly young kids.</v>

1155
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of my documentary was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually filming the amputees that lost </v>

1156
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.170
<v Speaker 1>their legs or arms when something went </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1157
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And your viewers can watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national geographic video still up </v>

1158
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:21.880
<v Speaker 1>on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>

1159
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

1160
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you would google old Istvan Slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam and go to youtube and it'll,</v>

1161
00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it'll appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1162
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called bomb diggers I think,</v>

1163
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but are just Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

1164
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a four minute clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shows like,</v>

1165
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1166
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 1>what these people go through on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

1167
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I just go out with a shovel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go out with metal detectors and </v>

1168
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:44.540
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d.</v>

1169
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and every step they take is out for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole week.</v>

1170
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:51.621
<v Speaker 1>I was freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like [inaudible] the DMZ is just </v>

1171
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 1>filled with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's been there.</v>

1172
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:57.051
<v Speaker 1>There's no villages in that immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>area because it's just too dangerous to </v>

1173
00:55:57.051 --> 00:55:57.500
<v Speaker 1>live some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1174
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's thousands of those thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thousands and what's worse is that </v>

1175
00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:08.001
<v Speaker 1>bomb digging a is attracting a younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and they make so much more </v>

1176
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 1>money than rice farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally a 100 times.</v>

1177
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:15.740
<v Speaker 1>If you find one six foot balm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feed your family for a year and </v>

1178
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you could find in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in one day's worth of work,</v>

1179
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you can make more than you could in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire season.</v>

1180
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:20.950
<v Speaker 1>So the</v>

1181
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 4>bomb is just the metal of the bomb or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bomb itself.</v>

1182
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Unexploded.</v>

1183
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.720
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the metal.</v>

1184
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:30.721
<v Speaker 1>They dismantle it and they sell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal that because they're only making </v>

1185
00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 1>$1 a day in their farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>

1186
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So they're so poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1187
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and they're very like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1188
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:38.671
<v Speaker 1>You nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The totally nice people and they were </v>

1189
00:56:38.671 --> 00:56:38.671
<v Speaker 1>happy to help me with my story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1190
00:56:38.671 --> 00:56:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1191
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1192
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1193
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they dismantle these things?</v>

1194
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So they have experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they find a big one,</v>

1195
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they carried into their village and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is another problem.</v>

1196
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 1>They fucking pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1197
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole problem and then they </v>

1198
00:56:59.770 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>hammer it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1199
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:03.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy and sometimes like half </v>

1200
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:05.851
<v Speaker 1>villages go up when they make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been a problem that's happened </v>

1201
00:57:05.851 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 1>in Laos is the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1202
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a couple of documentaries have now </v>
<v Speaker 1>been made since I did this and I think </v>

1203
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 1>in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2003,</v>

1204
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but a couple of real documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now they're a nonprofit </v>

1205
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:18.720
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1206
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>don't go bomb digging that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a fortune in a day.</v>

1207
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You might change your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
00:57:22.331 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

1209
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 1>your wealth of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not worth it because look,</v>

1210
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every 10 people that go out,</v>

1211
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.960
<v Speaker 1>two or three end up with amputees or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some end up completely dead and stuff </v>

1212
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 1>like that and so much more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just farming.</v>

1213
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 1>And has there been any effort whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the United States government to go in</v>

1214
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>there and clean it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1215
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So I did the story a long time ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point there wasn't much.</v>

1216
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 1>They just gave a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think money to make up for it.</v>

1217
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>But I actually don't know what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on now.</v>

1218
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I know that the nonprofits had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on trying to get them money.</v>

1219
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:58.400
<v Speaker 1>God just so it's so hard to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1220
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:03.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to think that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for all the bombs that you </v>

1221
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:03.500
<v Speaker 1>left behind.</v>

1222
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be one of the first things</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States deals with.</v>

1223
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And how difficult would it be to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweep of the entire country and find all</v>

1224
00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:13.090
<v Speaker 1>the bombs with the problem is like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area,</v>

1225
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.000
<v Speaker 1>the DMZ is all pretty big hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

1226
00:58:17.001 --> 00:58:22.001
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't be able to get tractors up </v>

1227
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:24.121
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's too much vegetation </v>

1228
00:58:24.121 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and everything's overgrown so nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what to do.</v>

1229
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It would be much easier just to throw a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money at it and uh,</v>

1230
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.320
<v Speaker 1>and try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1231
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.400
<v Speaker 1>get the UN or somebody to go in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sweep through it with metal </v>

1232
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 1>But what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1234
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:41.311
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that they have just </v>

1235
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:41.311
<v Speaker 1>left all that shit there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just what,</v>

1236
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 1>that's so dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bomb so much of the country.</v>

1237
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a staggering,</v>

1238
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it just when you actually study the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of how much they dropped,</v>

1239
00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I think they drop more.</v>

1240
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not 100 percent of this fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe they dropped more bombs in</v>

1241
00:58:54.551 --> 00:58:59.551
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam than all other wars or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that combined of the amount of </v>

1242
00:58:59.551 --> 00:59:03.360
<v Speaker 1>bombs and because at the time that's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did and um,</v>

1243
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you think about it's just </v>

1244
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:09.050
<v Speaker 1>literally millions and millions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of,</v>

1245
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:12.530
<v Speaker 1>of bombs and tons of bombs and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge percentage that just never </v>

1246
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 1>explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wow,</v>

1247
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying to think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be there 100 years from now.</v>

1248
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They're still potentially could be death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your kid could step on one or it </v>

1249
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 1>could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1250
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.280
<v Speaker 1>it might be just ready to probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

1251
00:59:26.281 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1252
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and then are just ready to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticked off for one reason.</v>

1253
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 1>One Ms dot wire or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1254
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.010
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a serious problem.</v>

1255
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look in the news,</v>

1256
00:59:35.811 --> 00:59:36.920
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1257
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:38.570
<v Speaker 1>another explosion happened here.</v>

1258
00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also not,</v>

1259
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>it's also quite substantial in Cambodia </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts that were bombed there and,</v>

1260
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Laos,</v>

1261
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 1>and then they have all the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

1262
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:53.080
<v Speaker 1>some of the countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just us at bombed at some of </v>

1263
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1264
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>north Vietnam bombed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1265
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1266
00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of unexploded stuff all </v>

1267
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:00.300
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this bomb,</v>

1268
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.661
<v Speaker 1>you almost step on it and then a switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off and you decide to change your </v>

1269
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1270
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1271
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I had been interested in transhumanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time I was in college.</v>

1272
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>We were given an essay on Cryonics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1273
01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1274
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>the field where you actually put dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>people into some type of freezing </v>

1275
01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.191
<v Speaker 1>compound and then in hopes in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years you will be able to have the </v>

1276
01:00:24.191 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>science to regenerate them and reanimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1277
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And our English class was asked to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>an essay on it and then debate it.</v>

1278
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was the very first time I was </v>

1279
01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.241
<v Speaker 1>introduced to it at about age 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started reading about </v>

1280
01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:40.151
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism and sort of fell in love </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this concept of using science and </v>

1281
01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>technology to become superhumans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just we don't need to worry about death,</v>

1283
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to worry about disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to worry about,</v>

1284
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things that plague our </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological beings.</v>

1286
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>We can use science and technology to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome it all.</v>

1287
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So I spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the next 10 years as I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sailing,</v>

1289
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:04.511
<v Speaker 1>just kind of reading about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being into it without doing anything </v>

1290
01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then after this incident,</v>

1291
01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I came back and began working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The transhumanist wager a,</v>

1292
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a novel about transhumanism.</v>

1293
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the.</v>

1294
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It took me many years to write the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a pretty long,</v>

1295
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:22.811
<v Speaker 1>complex philosophical novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at least 30 percent of the book is </v>

1296
01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>pure philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while it's a novel,</v>

1297
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not a novel in the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1298
01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:30.881
<v Speaker 1>you just read it and storyline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually huge amounts of just pure </v>

1299
01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>academic philosophy going through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the book did really well.</v>

1300
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1301
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:39.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking ever since about it </v>

1302
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:39.161
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1303
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten me a lot of trouble because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty controversial in what way?</v>

1304
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the main character jethro </v>

1305
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1306
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he says he will do anything to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely.</v>

1307
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And so naturally the book goes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its way to create an environment where </v>

1308
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>he can't do what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1309
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting a religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting against religious entities</v>

1310
01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>in America that are saying we don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans humanism,</v>

1311
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>we don't want it as part of a anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>

1312
01:02:08.031 --> 01:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So they sort of outlawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

1313
01:02:09.871 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>he kind of becomes a sort of a terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his own ideas.</v>

1314
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1315
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>he'll take it to all these extremes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end forms his own</v>

1316
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 3>nation called transfer mania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a floating seasteading platform.</v>

1317
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.910
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a volunteer ambassador at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seasteading institute.</v>

1318
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I know you've done something about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had Joe Corcoran.</v>

1319
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1320
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1321
01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I kind of did a big,</v>

1322
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:37.830
<v Speaker 3>about a third of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss the seasteading where a $10,000,</v>

1323
01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:42.850
<v Speaker 3>some of the smartest scientists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world work on creating the ability to </v>

1324
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>live indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the world says,</v>

1325
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1326
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not right.</v>

1327
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say we're going to take over </v>

1328
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>your country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And jethro says,</v>

1329
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.531
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start a world war and we </v>

1330
01:02:54.531 --> 01:02:56.331
<v Speaker 3>have the technology to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he ends up defeating the planet and </v>

1331
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 3>making it into a transhumanist minded </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning.</v>

1332
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.050
<v Speaker 3>What kind of crazy fucking thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in your head,</v>

1333
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 3>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He uses authoritarian ideas,</v>

1334
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:06.420
<v Speaker 3>and this has been the controversy of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

1335
01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of the transhumanist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the older one,</v>

1336
01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1337
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 3>we like it that you're writing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>transhumanism,</v>

1338
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 3>but we don't like that you're taking the</v>
<v Speaker 3>such extremes.</v>

1339
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.140
<v Speaker 3>But jethro is a militant leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

1340
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:24.290
<v Speaker 3>he wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His ideas to spread and they want to </v>

1341
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 3>keep taking away from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also in the book,</v>

1342
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 3>kill his wife and do all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1343
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:32.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's a novel where it's an epic from </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of his early childhood to the end </v>

1344
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:37.040
<v Speaker 3>or near the end of his life where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>transforms the world against everyone's </v>

1345
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.631
<v Speaker 3>willing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes the book controversial is </v>

1346
01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:43.311
<v Speaker 3>that nobody likes jethro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sort of this incredibly arrogant </v>

1347
01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>machine like human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet he's the good guy of the book and </v>

1348
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:48.890
<v Speaker 3>yet you sort of cheer for him because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he sort of a authoritarian,</v>

1350
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:55.770
<v Speaker 3>he sorted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would like him because he's driven.</v>

1351
01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:57.990
<v Speaker 3>He's like the greatest fighter you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever met who just,</v>

1352
01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.580
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell me about rules.</v>

1353
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just the best fighter,</v>

1354
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1355
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.380
<v Speaker 3>And on one hand that's very admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1356
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:09.381
<v Speaker 3>we have rules for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but jethro breaks them to get what he </v>

1357
01:04:09.381 --> 01:04:12.801
<v Speaker 3>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he made the transhumanist wager </v>

1358
01:04:12.801 --> 01:04:12.801
<v Speaker 3>where he really like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1359
01:04:12.801 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll put anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do anything to achieve it.</v>

1360
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:20.090
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the controversy comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in because clearly if we all did </v>

1361
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 3>anything we wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be in a,</v>

1362
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:24.270
<v Speaker 3>in a pretty hectic place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both politically,</v>

1363
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Swiss society,</v>

1364
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:28.320
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

1365
01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book has won a lot of praise and </v>

1366
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.900
<v Speaker 3>just as much criticism and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the,</v>

1367
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like an e,</v>

1368
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:40.680
<v Speaker 3>there's like a huge amount of one stars </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a huge amount of five stars,</v>

1369
01:04:40.681 --> 01:04:42.720
<v Speaker 3>but not much in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nobody said,</v>

1370
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:47.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone hates the book because they </v>

1371
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.750
<v Speaker 3>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1372
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.750
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1373
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.100
<v Speaker 3>this is an evil character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1374
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:49.590
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that like it say,</v>

1375
01:04:49.591 --> 01:04:54.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a character who actually wants </v>

1376
01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 3>to fight for what he believes in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1377
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:56.790
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary leaders or sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1378
01:04:56.791 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

1379
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.970
<v Speaker 3>they take us to different places and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they use different methods that um,</v>

1380
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly are questionable.</v>

1381
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fictional novel and you can take </v>

1382
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>it for what the artist's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1383
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:13.491
<v Speaker 3>this is where it gets complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you are planning on actually </v>

1384
01:05:13.491 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 3>running for president on a transhumanism</v>
<v Speaker 3>platform.</v>

1385
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Now when</v>

1386
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you've written a book about a world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets started by a good guy with a </v>

1387
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:28.831
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism agenda and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to run for president people go </v>

1388
01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:33.871
<v Speaker 1>this Zoltan Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker think about his name,</v>

1389
01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:39.001
<v Speaker 1>his name is Zoltan and he wants to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet and he wants to be a trans </v>

1390
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>humanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a robot.</v>

1391
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You're turning into a robot that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start a world war two,</v>

1392
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:44.180
<v Speaker 1>run the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's obviously not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

1394
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that is the most difficult</v>

1395
01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:53.521
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be asked probably a lot as </v>

1396
01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:53.521
<v Speaker 1>I move forward with the really going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

1397
01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:53.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1398
01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's already said.</v>

1399
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of stake my entire reputation </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it at this point.</v>

1400
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>We have some big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big publicity events,</v>

1401
01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>win?</v>

1402
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think I could win this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1403
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:08.701
<v Speaker 1>I think there's virtually no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at how far the </v>

1404
01:06:08.701 --> 01:06:09.930
<v Speaker 1>transhumans party might do by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1405
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

1406
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.200
<v Speaker 1>where I would potentially do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we might have a much better </v>

1407
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.341
<v Speaker 1>chance of making a dent now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be unrealistic and say </v>

1408
01:06:20.341 --> 01:06:23.881
<v Speaker 1>that we could actually win or that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could win the presidency or anything </v>

1409
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:23.881
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

1410
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I am definitely advocating for a run </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's taking all my time.</v>

1411
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm literally dedicating now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1412
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my waking hours towards this party.</v>

1413
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Really all the infrastructure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>

1414
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1415
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically,</v>

1416
01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on the different.</v>

1417
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>There's so many logistical things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one has to do,</v>

1418
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:47.101
<v Speaker 1>including just dealing with taxes for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity like this and registration </v>

1419
01:06:47.101 --> 01:06:48.610
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manifesto.</v>

1420
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>But in the next week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the infrastructure will be in </v>

1421
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1422
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>we're already have a lot of it in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a number of officers now.</v>

1423
01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1424
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.220
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going for it.</v>

1425
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stake everything I have on </v>

1426
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife has given the approval,</v>

1427
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 1>which is important because I got two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and her and we're going to do a lot</v>

1428
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>of campaigning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have some great events.</v>

1429
01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably,</v>

1430
01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>hopefully be down in a few weeks to La </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start a documentary on it without,</v>

1431
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:20.610
<v Speaker 1>which has a great budget by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think there'll be a lot of </v>

1432
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:23.941
<v Speaker 1>things coming out about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanist party that are going to </v>

1433
01:07:23.941 --> 01:07:26.341
<v Speaker 1>work really in the favor of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to think about what would it mean</v>

1434
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:28.830
<v Speaker 1>to have a political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1435
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>person running who actually wants to use</v>

1436
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:34.660
<v Speaker 1>technology and science to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

1437
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

1439
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 1>let's dabble a little bit in science </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>

1440
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>but I actually want to use technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and science to dominate politics.</v>

1441
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I think we can solve most of humanity's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and,</v>

1442
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and run a much better country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1443
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.980
<v Speaker 1>if we put politics and medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology sort of at the forefront of </v>

1444
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:58.650
<v Speaker 1>the government currently we're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront is a lot of other issues that </v>

1445
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 1>defense and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1446
01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1447
01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Taxes and all that stuff's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important of course,</v>

1448
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1449
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idealist and I would like to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so that we can.</v>

1450
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has the choice to potentially </v>

1451
01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.430
<v Speaker 1>not die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm pretty convinced that if we put </v>

1452
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>a trillion dollars towards conquering </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1453
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>we would probably achieve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most experts actually feel that way too.</v>

1454
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:27.041
<v Speaker 1>That the amount of money that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into life extension science right </v>

1455
01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>now is so small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally hundreds of millions.</v>

1456
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>But if we actually could quadruple or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe make it 20 times,</v>

1457
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:37.121
<v Speaker 1>then we could take the 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 year window and make it into 10 </v>

1458
01:08:37.121 --> 01:08:40.301
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the platforms is that </v>

1459
01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:40.301
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have the parties to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1460
01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:45.131
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take money from our wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are far off wars and put it directly </v>

1461
01:08:45.131 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>towards important things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Education,</v>

1462
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 1>science and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also life extension science.</v>

1463
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:52.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to enter your,</v>

1464
01:08:52.981 --> 01:08:53.450
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1465
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:58.660
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your somewhat dangerous question for me </v>

1466
01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:58.660
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1467
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm distancing myself from the book </v>

1468
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.571
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a moment of writing something </v>

1469
01:09:04.571 --> 01:09:05.900
<v Speaker 1>very artistic and trying to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>something very philosophical.</v>

1470
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:10.190
<v Speaker 1>But the philosophy of jethro nights does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not work in a political campaign,</v>

1471
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my best to disassociate myself</v>

1472
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>from his ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I,</v>

1473
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm the creator of the philosophy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one who sort of spent all these </v>

1474
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>years developing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never work.</v>

1475
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It would never work in America as we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1476
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>We live in a country that's very free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't a bunch of religious people</v>

1477
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:32.690
<v Speaker 1>trying to stamp out transhumanism in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1478
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.720
<v Speaker 1>He lives in a war environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of why he fights back with </v>

1479
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:37.720
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So luckily,</v>

1480
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a pretty awesome country.</v>

1481
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>You can mostly do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1482
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to convince people to do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than just building bombs and uh,</v>

1483
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:52.180
<v Speaker 1>and some of the crazy things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and spend it towards science and </v>

1484
01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>technology and it hoping that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>will eventually like it.</v>

1485
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Everyone will eventually live better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone will eventually kind of be </v>

1486
01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.971
<v Speaker 1>taken to a new era where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their families and their loved ones </v>

1487
01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 1>don't have to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all the benefits of technology.</v>

1488
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have traffic in La,</v>

1489
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.220
<v Speaker 1>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are kinds of things,</v>

1490
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driverless cars that are going to </v>

1491
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:12.340
<v Speaker 1>improve everything.</v>

1492
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think if more people embrace </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

1493
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.550
<v Speaker 1>we might go a lot further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1494
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 1>as a species and also as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The obvious question,</v>

1495
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say if people live forever or </v>

1496
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 1>people could get to a point where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't die,</v>

1497
01:10:25.731 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 1>we can conquer death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have too many people.</v>

1498
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>There's 7 billion people on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1499
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the number is now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1500
01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's going on fast.</v>

1501
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going up fast.</v>

1502
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

1503
01:10:38.661 --> 01:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>we were talking on the way about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling on the way over here,</v>

1504
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:45.110
<v Speaker 1>how difficult it was to get here because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traffic is so bad.</v>

1505
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:50.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 20 plus million people in Los </v>

1506
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if they keep having babies </v>

1507
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and no one dies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:57.581
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the most challenging </v>

1509
01:10:57.581 --> 01:11:00.670
<v Speaker 1>questions and most challenging ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the problem with transhumanism </v>

1510
01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:05.110
<v Speaker 1>right now is when we advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and science to change </v>

1511
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.110
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

1512
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And make them live longer and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first question everyone says,</v>

1513
01:11:07.911 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1514
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 1>we've got environmental problems in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and I agree we do.</v>

1515
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:16.541
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer in some of the climate </v>

1516
01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>change problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer in,</v>

1517
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a overpopulation.</v>

1518
01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to in any way try to deny </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these things.</v>

1519
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I actually think the science stands </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty strongly for it.</v>

1520
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.510
<v Speaker 1>The question though is whether tackling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that broadly,</v>

1521
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm tackling environmental problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of ideas that we're trying to </v>

1522
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:40.761
<v Speaker 1>do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm less population a recycling and you </v>

1523
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:42.080
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like,</v>

1524
01:11:42.081 --> 01:11:47.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the basic things we're trying to </v>

1525
01:11:47.081 --> 01:11:47.081
<v Speaker 1>empower ourselves to be a more green </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1526
01:11:47.081 --> 01:11:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not 100 percent sure that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the accurate or that is the very best </v>

1527
01:11:51.421 --> 01:11:56.421
<v Speaker 1>path we can take a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this gets kind of SPEC speculative </v>

1528
01:11:56.421 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and I don't actually endorse this </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily as,</v>

1529
01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of a political platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty quiet.</v>

1530
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Pretty convinced that within 25 to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years people will start downloading </v>

1531
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 1>their consciousness into machines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1532
01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea that maybe we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>start using a lot less resources 100 </v>

1533
01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:15.240
<v Speaker 1>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1534
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 1>because people will live in digital </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and virtual lives.</v>

1535
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1536
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll all live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the entire population will fit </v>

1537
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1538
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.770
<v Speaker 1>empire state building that is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>servers as we had discussed.</v>

1539
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the earth will have a chance </v>

1540
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>to grow back or come back to what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1541
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's formed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the,</v>

1542
01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:32.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1543
01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:37.461
<v Speaker 1>that's just one of the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculative ideas that trans humanists </v>

1544
01:12:37.461 --> 01:12:41.990
<v Speaker 1>might use to counter some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism that we get a about </v>

1545
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 1>environmental prompts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm personally,</v>

1546
01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 1>what I'm for is for a lot of the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

1547
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the stuff I want to see.</v>

1548
01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to see solar power increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see money going towards that.</v>

1549
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to see money going towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>windmills.</v>

1550
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to see money going towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>green types of technologies that not </v>

1551
01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 1>only can make a whole new generation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy people and give millions of jobs</v>

1552
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also,</v>

1553
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:05.490
<v Speaker 1>at the same time help the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1554
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take this two fold approach,</v>

1555
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:12.291
<v Speaker 1>one is very speculative in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be space exploration and all </v>

1556
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:15.981
<v Speaker 1>these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might figure out a ways that don't </v>

1557
01:13:15.981 --> 01:13:19.761
<v Speaker 1>make us so dependent on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more important ways that we're </v>

1558
01:13:19.761 --> 01:13:22.290
<v Speaker 1>going to spend money on the type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that really make the planet</v>

1559
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 1>get people to move into cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them green or a leave,</v>

1561
01:13:26.971 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 1>open spaces their loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a big animal advocate as well.</v>

1562
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I worked with wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my national geographic work was</v>

1563
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:35.130
<v Speaker 1>with wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1564
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see the species replenished.</v>

1565
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see it so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go to national parks and have </v>

1566
01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.431
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things that we all hope for</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you see deer and you could take </v>

1567
01:13:46.431 --> 01:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>your children out there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially in afterwards.</v>

1568
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 1>So much poaching and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1569
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1570
01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 1>in America we do a pretty good job with </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting our wildlife.</v>

1571
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.480
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1572
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see us be more of a leader </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the international front staying.</v>

1573
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>We actually need to say stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that the tiger population is </v>

1574
01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>literally on the edge of extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally gone.</v>

1575
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.350
<v Speaker 1>There are more tigers in Texas than </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are in the wild.</v>

1576
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad.</v>

1577
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible because they are an </v>
<v Speaker 4>important part of the,</v>

1578
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:17.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ecosystem in all the places that are</v>

1579
01:14:17.381 --> 01:14:18.870
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1580
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 4>one of the stories we covered was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Siamese crocodile when I was in Cambodia</v>

1581
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple in captivity,</v>

1582
01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 4>but basically the last time someone saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>one was like 13 years ago in the wild.</v>

1583
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.790
<v Speaker 4>And so it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1584
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially gone.</v>

1585
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.740
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it,</v>

1586
01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:36.130
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1587
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:39.530
<v Speaker 4>that's a certain species just basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone and why is it going on?</v>

1588
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 4>People were making boots and stuff out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it's tails and whatnot.</v>

1589
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
<v Speaker 4>So I would like to advocate for policies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of make that happen less and,</v>

1590
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:53.401
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>generally increase our environmental </v>

1591
01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 4>consciousness with money instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>building bombs,</v>

1592
01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:54.540
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1593
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 4>let's spend it on building electric </v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

1594
01:14:56.531 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 4>Let's spend it on other ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even more unique ideas than that.</v>

1595
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things to discuss </v>

1596
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:05.220
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1597
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:05.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of this,</v>

1598
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:09.310
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about downloading </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness into computers,</v>

1599
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 4>so you're kind of advocating a non </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological life.</v>

1600
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.880
<v Speaker 4>You're kind of advocating life inside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a server,</v>

1601
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 4>a virtual life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1602
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:22.801
<v Speaker 4>that will be the future of life that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>really hard for people to conceptualize.</v>

1603
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:29.010
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard for the average person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who just likes to go on facebook every </v>

1604
01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:32.431
<v Speaker 4>now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>post pictures of their dog with a </v>

1605
01:15:32.431 --> 01:15:32.431
<v Speaker 4>fucking boner had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1606
01:15:32.431 --> 01:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Like one day you're going to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer like that's going to.</v>

1607
01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 4>It won't be just your photos in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>

1608
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:41.850
<v Speaker 4>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your consciousness will live in a </v>

1609
01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:44.431
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body will die and you will exist </v>

1610
01:15:44.431 --> 01:15:44.440
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in ones and Zeros,</v>

1611
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:49.710
<v Speaker 4>in some sort of a program like that to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that doesn't seem like </v>

1612
01:15:50.531 --> 01:15:51.040
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1613
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:55.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could get to a point in our lifetimes</v>

1614
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 4>where it is indistinguishable from life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is in fact,</v>

1615
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:05.250
<v Speaker 4>one of the freakiest ideas that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>bandied about today by people far more </v>

1616
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:09.301
<v Speaker 4>intelligent than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not my own philosophical stoner </v>

1617
01:16:09.301 --> 01:16:12.030
<v Speaker 4>ramblings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the concept of living right now in </v>

1618
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a computer simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this has been discussed ad nauseum </v>

1619
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 4>amongst physicists and scientists that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to come,</v>

1620
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna come a point in time where</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will be able to create some sort of a</v>

1621
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:31.180
<v Speaker 4>virtual life that is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from the life that you</v>

1622
01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 4>and I are experiencing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's the case,</v>

1623
01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.730
<v Speaker 4>how do we know we're not already in it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1624
01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:38.290
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the big mind.</v>

1625
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1626
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.360
<v Speaker 4>That's the big mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1627
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:42.600
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to quantum theory and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1628
01:16:42.601 --> 01:16:47.601
<v Speaker 4>when people start talking about virtual </v>
<v Speaker 4>realities is that we may already be in </v>

1629
01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:47.601
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1630
01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I did my senior thesis at university on </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains in a VAT exact same concept.</v>

1631
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:57.601
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent like a whole month writing a 24 </v>

1632
01:16:57.601 --> 01:16:57.601
<v Speaker 4>page paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1633
01:16:57.601 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after writing the paper,</v>

1634
01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:03.031
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took me like a week to even become </v>

1635
01:17:03.031 --> 01:17:03.031
<v Speaker 4>normal again because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

1636
01:17:03.031 --> 01:17:04.990
<v Speaker 4>you can't choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that scares me,</v>

1637
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't say I'm not in one arm in one.</v>

1638
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1639
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a totally freaky concept.</v>

1640
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1641
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:15.200
<v Speaker 4>you can't say it and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen if we don't,</v>

1642
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 4>if that super volcano doesn't blow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we don't get hit by the media,</v>

1643
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 4>there's going to come a point in time if</v>
<v Speaker 4>technology continues to increase,</v>

1644
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:27.941
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 50 years from now or 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years from now or a thousand years from </v>

1645
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:32.081
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our ability to control reality itself </v>

1646
01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 4>will reach some sort of an epic point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we can create a virtual reality.</v>

1647
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've messed around with </v>
<v Speaker 4>oculus rift.</v>

1648
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1649
01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.820
<v Speaker 4>I haven't tried the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried.</v>

1650
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.990
<v Speaker 4>My friend Duncan is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's um,</v>

1651
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 4>he's got the old model and now he has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new model.</v>

1652
01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Here's the developer's kit and the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>one I put on,</v>

1653
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 4>it was all pixelated and weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it gave you the sense like,</v>

1654
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of freaky.</v>

1655
01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.040
<v Speaker 4>He called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to some sort of a virtual </v>

1656
01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.131
<v Speaker 4>conference that they had in Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he called me up just ranting and </v>

1657
01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 4>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over,</v>

1658
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is bigger than the printing press.</v>

1659
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 4>This is bigger than the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is fucking over.</v>

1660
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is gonna be reality,</v>

1661
01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:16.721
<v Speaker 4>and he was just freaking out so much so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm scared to go and try this </v>

1662
01:18:16.721 --> 01:18:19.310
<v Speaker 4>headset on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was talking about going into some</v>

1663
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:24.311
<v Speaker 4>virtual room where there's a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing the piano and you you interact </v>

1664
01:18:24.311 --> 01:18:28.241
<v Speaker 4>with them and you feel like you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the room with them and he said it was </v>

1665
01:18:28.241 --> 01:18:28.790
<v Speaker 4>the freakiest thing he's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced in his life because it's all</v>

1666
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:32.410
<v Speaker 4>in like four k hd super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1667
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.990
<v Speaker 4>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really clear video.</v>

1668
01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:41.260
<v Speaker 4>And they apparently the way they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put cameras all over the person's </v>

1669
01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 4>body when they film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This camera's on your hands,</v>

1670
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:48.311
<v Speaker 4>cameras on your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everywhere you look they have it </v>

1671
01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:52.271
<v Speaker 4>covered and it's just a matter of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>processing power of being able to keep </v>

1672
01:18:52.271 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 4>up with all the different potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>views that you have.</v>

1673
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Same as when you're going into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>

1674
01:18:57.831 --> 01:19:02.831
<v Speaker 4>three d generated world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a video game like quake or </v>

1675
01:19:02.831 --> 01:19:03.740
<v Speaker 4>something like that where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>down corridors and you could look up and</v>

1676
01:19:03.741 --> 01:19:05.600
<v Speaker 4>look down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have it like that.</v>

1677
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:10.750
<v Speaker 4>But they have it in complete the read </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimensional hd video to the point where </v>

1678
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.180
<v Speaker 4>it it's indistinguishable from actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at these things in real life and</v>

1679
01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.530
<v Speaker 4>that's just now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1680
01:19:18.531 --> 01:19:23.531
<v Speaker 4>what does that going to be like 50 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>from now when they figure out how to do </v>

1681
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:27.030
<v Speaker 4>something on your head where they put </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1682
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:32.210
<v Speaker 4>electrodes or something where they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulate parts of your mind that can </v>

1683
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:37.451
<v Speaker 4>give you the sensations of the feel of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wooden floor giving slightly under </v>

1684
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:40.670
<v Speaker 4>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the texture of a wall.</v>

1685
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:45.671
<v Speaker 4>As you run your fingers by you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be able to feel that on your </v>

1686
01:19:45.671 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 4>fingertips and then a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that,</v>

1687
01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.800
<v Speaker 4>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1688
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:49.340
<v Speaker 4>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens then?</v>

1689
01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 4>What happens then it keeps going and </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and going and going,</v>

1690
01:19:51.741 --> 01:19:56.741
<v Speaker 4>and if you extrapolate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at where we are now and you </v>

1691
01:19:56.741 --> 01:19:59.591
<v Speaker 4>look at the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible for us to not </v>

1692
01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:02.410
<v Speaker 4>reach a point where were </v>
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable where reality and </v>

1693
01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality are indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 4>from each other.</v>

1694
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't agree more.</v>

1695
01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>And if you try that stuff on,</v>

1696
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 3>that's really the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like the landmine thing.</v>

1697
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Once you've tried that on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is such a freaky thing that </v>

1698
01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:15.260
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1699
01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 3>this is here today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1700
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in 10,</v>

1701
01:20:17.071 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 3>15 years common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's common.</v>

1702
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:23.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of younger people get that</v>

1703
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.340
<v Speaker 3>because they either tried it or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool with it.</v>

1704
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:27.560
<v Speaker 3>They grew up like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1705
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.840
<v Speaker 3>my 11 month old or a 10 month old </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter is already quite adept.</v>

1706
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:37.910
<v Speaker 3>She's already pretty quite good at using</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the ipad and skipping through </v>

1707
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:41.271
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know what the APP's mean </v>

1708
01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:42.561
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's only 11 months and she's just </v>

1709
01:20:42.561 --> 01:20:43.200
<v Speaker 3>growing up with this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for her,</v>

1710
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:46.770
<v Speaker 3>I think to put on a virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>setup,</v>

1711
01:20:46.771 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be in 10 years or 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not going to even dent her.</v>

1712
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to be scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be,</v>

1713
01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:53.730
<v Speaker 3>have heard the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be,</v>

1714
01:20:53.731 --> 01:20:55.860
<v Speaker 3>have heard transhumanism for the last 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1715
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:58.130
<v Speaker 3>It will be like stepping in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1716
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:03.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when people first talked about </v>

1717
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.770
<v Speaker 3>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they must have thought,</v>

1718
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:06.561
<v Speaker 3>well how weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean we're going to get rid </v>

1719
01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.031
<v Speaker 3>of the horse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next generation thought </v>

1720
01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:08.031
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you guys were in a horse</v>

1721
01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:11.660
<v Speaker 3>and sort of like the way we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>either fax machines now or you know,</v>

1722
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 3>the new generation is going to take it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and run with it and they're not going to</v>

1723
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:21.291
<v Speaker 3>be afraid of it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's people our age that are </v>

1724
01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:24.291
<v Speaker 3>already still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like a little skeptical and then </v>

1725
01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:27.051
<v Speaker 3>it's people above us that are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>still out there and they have to </v>

1726
01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:27.051
<v Speaker 3>actually test it to see it.</v>

1727
01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 3>But in 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter who tests it,</v>

1728
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be so real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the philosophical dilemma there </v>

1729
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 3>is that people are gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1730
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:39.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people like myself,</v>

1731
01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:39.930
<v Speaker 3>we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1732
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.220
<v Speaker 3>why not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1733
01:21:41.221 --> 01:21:43.950
<v Speaker 3>what makes that real knife just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's created,</v>

1734
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:44.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1735
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.840
<v Speaker 3>through a machine how to say this hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>created through a machine.</v>

1736
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the say?</v>

1737
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.280
<v Speaker 3>This is so different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You touched something in there and it </v>

1738
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.040
<v Speaker 3>feels maybe even more real than it does </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1739
01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the touching of wood there as we </v>

1740
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:01.280
<v Speaker 3>had talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have sensors on your fingers,</v>

1741
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not just touching wood will be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to determine the strength of that would.</v>

1742
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1743
01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:06.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do all these things right now,</v>

1744
01:22:06.841 --> 01:22:11.841
<v Speaker 3>but for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing an article right now on I'm </v>

1745
01:22:11.841 --> 01:22:13.250
<v Speaker 3>blind people using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1746
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:18.410
<v Speaker 3>artificial robotic eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bionic eyes to see and they're now </v>

1747
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:22.850
<v Speaker 3>basically kind of doing a surgery where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they put something into your eye and </v>

1748
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:27.051
<v Speaker 3>then they can program it through these </v>
<v Speaker 3>goggles that you wear and blind people </v>

1749
01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:27.051
<v Speaker 3>can now effectively see.</v>

1750
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.040
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1751
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.230
<v Speaker 3>the character on star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1752
01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:32.390
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it looks like to it.</v>

1753
01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the argus two is one of the </v>

1754
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 3>latest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1755
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1756
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.541
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point though is that part of my </v>

1757
01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:41.541
<v Speaker 3>articles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing now?</v>

1758
01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Because last year they went from like </v>
<v Speaker 3>black and white to upgrading the eyes to</v>

1759
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 3>color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can program in the certain types of</v>

1760
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:50.040
<v Speaker 3>lights that hit color into your nerve </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>

1761
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:55.490
<v Speaker 3>but soon they're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>programming things like we talked about </v>

1762
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:58.311
<v Speaker 3>gases or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually it's just a matter of the </v>

1763
01:22:58.311 --> 01:22:59.370
<v Speaker 3>machinery will be able to have whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities you can give it.</v>

1764
01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:00.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1765
01:23:00.441 --> 01:23:03.870
<v Speaker 3>you were not limited anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our eyeballs are limited to its biology,</v>

1766
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 3>but if we have robotic that ties</v>

1767
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 1>into the nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nervous system can understand </v>

1768
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.831
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason we don't see much more than </v>

1769
01:23:13.831 --> 01:23:13.831
<v Speaker 1>we see is because our eyeballs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

1770
01:23:13.831 --> 01:23:18.211
<v Speaker 1>they're quite poor when you give a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about what kind of </v>

1771
01:23:18.211 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms are out there that can really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be attached inside there.</v>

1772
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

1773
01:23:21.341 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>the articles about what is the future of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 year future of Ra,</v>

1774
01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:30.230
<v Speaker 1>a bionic eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a pretty big believer that </v>

1775
01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:33.300
<v Speaker 1>within 10 years we'll have bionic eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are almost equivalent of the human </v>

1776
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.831
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And probably within 15 or 20 years </v>

1777
01:23:37.831 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>people will start replacing one of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes for the bionic one.</v>

1778
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they'll do so is because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1779
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:46.651
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just seeing one percent of the </v>

1780
01:23:46.651 --> 01:23:49.141
<v Speaker 1>universe anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computers and the programs and the </v>

1781
01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:49.141
<v Speaker 1>devices will be able to see far more.</v>

1782
01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:50.320
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be able to see through </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls.</v>

1783
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1784
01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.080
<v Speaker 1>this is stuff companies are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally working on right now.</v>

1785
01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:00.420
<v Speaker 1>This is blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have already seen this happen in </v>

1786
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.881
<v Speaker 1>2012 and 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're starting to upgrade the </v>

1787
01:24:02.881 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 1>software and you know what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start upgrading things.</v>

1788
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1789
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:09.991
<v Speaker 1>we got the apparatus in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see what kind of magic this </v>

1790
01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:09.991
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just the eyeball.</v>

1791
01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 1>The same thing's happening with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human heart.</v>

1792
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 1>The same thing's going to be happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ear very soon we're going to be</v>

1793
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:19.861
<v Speaker 1>replacing place parts in ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going for upgrades and our lives are </v>

1794
01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 1>going to become much more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better live longer,</v>

1795
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but also experience will be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experience will be sort of like virtual </v>

1796
01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.911
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a different experience that </v>

1797
01:24:32.911 --> 01:24:33.370
<v Speaker 1>once you've gone through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize it's kind of,</v>

1798
01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:38.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you talk a little bit about </v>

1799
01:24:38.371 --> 01:24:38.371
<v Speaker 1>drugs in the show and I'm a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>proponent of,</v>

1800
01:24:38.371 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 1>of experimental drugs myself.</v>

1801
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's quite great for,</v>

1802
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:46.360
<v Speaker 1>for kids to do all sorts of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including adults.</v>

1803
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just fucked up your presidential </v>

1804
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>chances right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1805
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great for kids to do drugs.</v>

1806
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1807
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:51.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1808
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1809
01:24:53.831 --> 01:24:58.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 20 somethings 21 year olds and above </v>

1810
01:24:58.831 --> 01:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>those youngins yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1811
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 40 I guess kids or anything,</v>

1812
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their twenties,</v>

1813
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>in their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1814
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wacky kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately,</v>

1815
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we like it or not and whether,</v>

1816
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1817
01:25:10.811 --> 01:25:15.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm not running on some presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign to try to be the guy who </v>

1818
01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:15.811
<v Speaker 1>pretends these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1819
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm luckily not at that point yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in eight years I'll have to wash a</v>

1820
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:21.880
<v Speaker 1>lot more what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now I'm a big.</v>

1821
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I think you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think eight years from now we're going</v>

1822
01:25:25.471 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 1>to be able to know exactly what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>without you even have an accent.</v>

1823
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I think eight years from now we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have such amazing access to each </v>

1824
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 1>other's minds that are getting closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and closer.</v>

1825
01:25:35.951 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:41.881
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to have to </v>

1827
01:25:41.881 --> 01:25:41.881
<v Speaker 1>worry about people lying anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1828
01:25:41.881 --> 01:25:41.881
<v Speaker 1>that would be great because then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't,</v>

1829
01:25:41.881 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 1>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can know when they're pretending </v>

1830
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1831
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is,</v>

1832
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us in many of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners,</v>

1833
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.960
<v Speaker 1>we all realize that there are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things out there that the government </v>

1834
01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.670
<v Speaker 1>considers illegal considers terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been very useful for artists,</v>

1835
01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:58.600
<v Speaker 1>creative types and basically people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general to expand their consciousness.</v>

1836
01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>the technology will be also some new </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of enabling us to</v>

1838
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 4>expand our consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

1839
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:10.391
<v Speaker 4>if we have a bionic eye and it allows us</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see different things that's going to </v>

1840
01:26:10.391 --> 01:26:14.470
<v Speaker 4>mess with our consciousness in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can combine that with all sorts </v>

1841
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.470
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1842
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big advocate and in doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1843
01:26:16.521 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>as long as it doesn't harm someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's open game.</v>

1844
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that when you,</v>

1845
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 4>when you think about the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>improving our organs,</v>

1846
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.120
<v Speaker 4>I think we could also look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural world and what we know about </v>

1847
01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 4>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look what dogs can smell like the,</v>

1848
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.400
<v Speaker 4>the incredible ability that some animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to see things like my friend Matt </v>

1849
01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:43.650
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lives in Alaska and we were talking </v>

1850
01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:45.431
<v Speaker 4>this weekend about fishing and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that sometimes when they fish </v>

1851
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:49.340
<v Speaker 4>they'll catch sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they pull them out of the,</v>

1852
01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:50.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean,</v>

1853
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:52.430
<v Speaker 4>like the catch them accidentally when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fishing for halibut.</v>

1854
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:57.700
<v Speaker 4>And when they released them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they on the surface of the water and </v>

1855
01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:01.000
<v Speaker 4>eagles can see them from a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can see a fish just swimming on the</v>

1856
01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:05.150
<v Speaker 4>surface of the water from a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll just show up.</v>

1857
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:08.000
<v Speaker 4>They show up and they grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like their eyes,</v>

1858
01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 4>like our vision of what that could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

1859
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:16.690
<v Speaker 4>but think about like you can see a fire </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the distance and aunt has no fucking </v>

1860
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.140
<v Speaker 4>idea that fires out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1861
01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Jamie was showing me this photo of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a huge fire last night in Los </v>

1862
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Angeles and from a distance it looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1863
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a bomb had gone off.</v>

1864
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a missile would hit some </v>
<v Speaker 4>apartment building.</v>

1865
01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 4>It was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge fire,</v>

1866
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 4>melted signs that we're saying on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>1:10</v>

1867
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.170
<v Speaker 4>now we can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to a worm,</v>

1868
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:40.640
<v Speaker 4>they have no fucking idea that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1869
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:45.730
<v Speaker 4>So we already know that biologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are animals that have organs that </v>

1870
01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 4>work far better than the ones that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

1871
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:52.700
<v Speaker 4>So we're completely aware that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to smell things,</v>

1872
01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:57.701
<v Speaker 4>their ability to hear things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can just ruffle your fingers </v>

1873
01:27:57.701 --> 01:28:01.991
<v Speaker 4>together slightly across the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my cat's ear will like turn like </v>

1874
01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:05.651
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can hear shit that I couldn't even </v>

1875
01:28:05.651 --> 01:28:07.760
<v Speaker 4>hope to hear in a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know those organs exist.</v>

1876
01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:12.940
<v Speaker 4>We know that their capacities are far </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond anything that we have and if we </v>

1877
01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:16.631
<v Speaker 4>start giving people cat eyes and cat </v>
<v Speaker 4>ears and dog noses and you know the </v>

1878
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:21.941
<v Speaker 4>ability to do that mean we will </v>
<v Speaker 4>radically transform human existence just</v>

1879
01:28:22.611 --> 01:28:27.611
<v Speaker 4>based on not even fantastical like </v>
<v Speaker 4>science fiction versions of these </v>

1880
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:33.011
<v Speaker 4>organs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but organs that we know exist in the </v>

1881
01:28:33.011 --> 01:28:33.011
<v Speaker 4>biological world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1882
01:28:33.011 --> 01:28:33.230
<v Speaker 4>a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>

1883
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my,</v>

1884
01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.520
<v Speaker 4>my articles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the funniest things about the </v>

1885
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 4>articles that it's quite possible within</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years of blind person will see better</v>

1886
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 4>than a normal biological person where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have the ability to see,</v>

1887
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:51.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 150 miles and they'll have ability to </v>

1888
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.390
<v Speaker 4>see various tiny things that are.</v>

1889
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 4>The human eye can never see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how far technology has come where</v>

1890
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:56.950
<v Speaker 4>a blind person has better site than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real person.</v>

1891
01:28:56.951 --> 01:29:01.951
<v Speaker 4>Now it's not here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's definitely probably going to </v>

1892
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:01.951
<v Speaker 4>happen within the next decade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1893
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:05.260
<v Speaker 4>I have reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a little little glasses as I'm 47 </v>

1894
01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.841
<v Speaker 4>and as I've gotten older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's happened is </v>

1895
01:29:08.841 --> 01:29:08.910
<v Speaker 4>most likely from fucking staring at </v>
<v Speaker 4>screens all the time.</v>

1896
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:12.600
<v Speaker 4>My closeup vision starting to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I can,</v>

1897
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I can read like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my iphone,</v>

1898
01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:16.110
<v Speaker 4>I can read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>

1899
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no issues at all.</v>

1900
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:22.550
<v Speaker 4>But when I start reading small print,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all small website or something like</v>

1901
01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:27.891
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I need to put on the reading </v>

1902
01:29:27.891 --> 01:29:28.050
<v Speaker 4>glasses in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One and a half.</v>

1903
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:32.250
<v Speaker 4>What regular vision is like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's one plus 50.</v>

1904
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:34.860
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like robotics.</v>

1905
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is like this is technology.</v>

1906
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting something over my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes my eyes right now.</v>

1907
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 4>It just goes over and some people they </v>
<v Speaker 4>get Lasik,</v>

1908
01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:44.550
<v Speaker 4>they changed their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their actual lens,</v>

1909
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 4>they cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do it with technology,</v>

1910
01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:51.561
<v Speaker 4>they changed the form of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people get artificial lens is put </v>

1911
01:29:51.561 --> 01:29:55.251
<v Speaker 4>in when they have issues or or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get injuries and I know fighters </v>

1912
01:29:55.251 --> 01:29:57.090
<v Speaker 4>who've gotten artificial lenses put into</v>
<v Speaker 4>their eyes.</v>

1913
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:00.540
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna Creep up on us.</v>

1914
01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:03.810
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like people with hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>aids and you know,</v>

1915
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.840
<v Speaker 4>some folks have artificial hips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who was an artificial </v>

1916
01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:12.681
<v Speaker 4>hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have another friend who is an </v>

1917
01:30:12.681 --> 01:30:12.681
<v Speaker 4>artificial knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1918
01:30:12.681 --> 01:30:15.041
<v Speaker 4>and these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are becoming more and more </v>

1919
01:30:15.041 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 4>commonplace where they are taking parts </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are not working well anymore and </v>

1920
01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 4>replacing them with robotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just doing an article apparently I</v>

1921
01:30:20.881 --> 01:30:25.881
<v Speaker 4>think around 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the world have this cochlear </v>

1922
01:30:25.881 --> 01:30:30.141
<v Speaker 4>implant which is actually inside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's 300 thousands.</v>

1923
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Not like $300.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a huge number around the </v>

1924
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:35.700
<v Speaker 4>world that are having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing problems that have this,</v>

1925
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:40.820
<v Speaker 4>that decided to go undergo a surgery </v>
<v Speaker 4>that involves her skull and head </v>

1926
01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:43.820
<v Speaker 4>essentially and have this implanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great because um,</v>

1927
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:49.120
<v Speaker 4>and those people apparently here far </v>
<v Speaker 4>better and now society is changing.</v>

1928
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:55.460
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take take interviews like </v>

1929
01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:55.790
<v Speaker 4>this where people hear about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1930
01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.590
<v Speaker 4>if you hear about enough times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden you're like,</v>

1931
01:30:58.591 --> 01:31:03.591
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I know someone else did that or </v>

1932
01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:03.591
<v Speaker 4>this dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1933
01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 4>And eventually everyone will sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully start to say,</v>

1934
01:31:04.171 --> 01:31:05.100
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great,</v>

1935
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1936
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1937
01:31:06.481 --> 01:31:11.481
<v Speaker 4>I think the big thing is really getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot more government funding for these </v>

1938
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:15.240
<v Speaker 4>kinds of things because sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems so speculative,</v>

1939
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:20.270
<v Speaker 4>but if we improve the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve people's biological beings and </v>

1940
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:24.741
<v Speaker 4>their livelihoods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to argue with that kind of </v>

1941
01:31:24.741 --> 01:31:24.741
<v Speaker 4>logic.</v>

1942
01:31:24.741 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just the skin better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is getting better.</v>

1943
01:31:25.711 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 4>And as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to technology,</v>

1944
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:31.870
<v Speaker 4>if we don't blow ourselves up or the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1945
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.000
<v Speaker 4>the universe doesn't send a rock our </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1946
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:37.380
<v Speaker 4>It seems inevitable that we'll continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>this progress.</v>

1947
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It just seems inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's a certain duty that </v>

1948
01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially folks like you have that have</v>

1949
01:31:45.481 --> 01:31:50.481
<v Speaker 4>the scientific know how our knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the information to inform people </v>

1950
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:55.440
<v Speaker 4>that this process is underway and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>better prepare yourself because there's,</v>

1951
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 4>there's no getting away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as we are human beings,</v>

1952
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:04.350
<v Speaker 4>we are never satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a horsepower revolution right </v>

1953
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:07.531
<v Speaker 4>now with cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotten completely on hand and </v>

1954
01:32:07.531 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 4>totally ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're aware if you're a</v>

1955
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 4>car person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in performance cars,</v>

1956
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 4>they've reached this staggering level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

1957
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:16.660
<v Speaker 4>At the highest end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have an American car now called the</v>

1958
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 4>challenger Hellcat.</v>

1959
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I drove one when I was in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has 770 horsepower.</v>

1960
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.530
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking insane and it is a run of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mill,</v>

1961
01:32:27.230 --> 01:32:30.670
<v Speaker 4>not run of the mill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a standard production car.</v>

1962
01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.920
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get it from a Chrysler dealership or</v>

1963
01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 4>you go to a dodge dealership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he pick up an srt,</v>

1964
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 4>challenger it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drive it off the lot.</v>

1965
01:32:37.121 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to go to some flight </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

1966
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:44.460
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to show any incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>proficiency with high performance </v>

1967
01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:47.881
<v Speaker 4>engines and they have cars now that </v>
<v Speaker 4>regularly hit zero to 60 in less than </v>

1968
01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:54.211
<v Speaker 4>three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less than three seconds and they're </v>

1969
01:32:54.211 --> 01:32:55.120
<v Speaker 4>going 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1970
01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is far faster than race cars</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a couple of decades ago and it's </v>

1971
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 4>going to get faster and faster and </v>
<v Speaker 4>faster and if eventually we're all going</v>

1972
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 4>to be driving like formula one race cars</v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1973
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be that bizarre and it </v>

1974
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.690
<v Speaker 4>exists in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing it now in internet speeds.</v>

1975
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing it in processor speeds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers when they.</v>

1976
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:20.500
<v Speaker 4>When they eventually do go public with </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantum computing,</v>

1977
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 4>it's going to reach an entirely new </v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

1978
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand quantum </v>
<v Speaker 4>computing.</v>

1979
01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:29.611
<v Speaker 4>I've read several articles on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to wrap my head around what the </v>

1980
01:33:29.611 --> 01:33:30.640
<v Speaker 4>fuck it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it,</v>

1981
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but apparently in my crude understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it is they're going to be able to </v>

1982
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.930
<v Speaker 4>create computers that aren't just 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times stronger than the,</v>

1983
01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:42.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Mac book I'm using,</v>

1984
01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:47.611
<v Speaker 4>but a million times or 10 million times </v>
<v Speaker 4>or 100 million times where they have </v>

1985
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:52.480
<v Speaker 4>processing power that is literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>unimaginable.</v>

1986
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Like we will get to a point again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 100 years or 500 years from</v>

1987
01:33:58.271 --> 01:34:03.271
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get to a point where we </v>

1988
01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:05.140
<v Speaker 4>are masters of the universe where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally become gods.</v>

1989
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:10.320
<v Speaker 4>We become an entity that has the ability</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate all matter all the time </v>

1990
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 4>and my issue with that is when this gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the hands of everyday folks,</v>

1991
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:22.290
<v Speaker 4>we have a problem already in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country with guns and the problem is </v>

1992
01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:25.531
<v Speaker 4>mostly people with mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gun problem in this country is not </v>

1993
01:34:25.571 --> 01:34:29.200
<v Speaker 4>nearly as bad as people think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I mean by that.</v>

1994
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.980
<v Speaker 4>There are 350 million people in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1995
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 4>The amount of actual mass shootings we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have is very rare.</v>

1996
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.070
<v Speaker 4>When you consider how many people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

1997
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:40.900
<v Speaker 4>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mental health issue,</v>

1998
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 4>but the issue is you're giving a one </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual who is mentally ill,</v>

1999
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.820
<v Speaker 4>they have the ability to get in control </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this device,</v>

2000
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.000
<v Speaker 4>a gun which can cause all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible damage.</v>

2001
01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:55.030
<v Speaker 4>What happens when it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking about a gun,</v>

2002
01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulate matter.</v>

2003
01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.920
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about something that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to radically transform the </v>

2004
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:07.160
<v Speaker 4>environment in some sort of a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this responsibility</v>

2005
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 3>can't be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be</v>

2006
01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:12.690
<v Speaker 4>overemphasized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's it's.</v>

2007
01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:18.140
<v Speaker 4>We could get to a point where an average</v>
<v Speaker 4>human being has the ability to create </v>

2008
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.690
<v Speaker 4>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2009
01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.490
<v Speaker 4>with the average human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has the ability to completely alter life</v>

2010
01:35:23.491 --> 01:35:26.490
<v Speaker 4>as we know it for everyone else who </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists on this planet,</v>

2011
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:28.350
<v Speaker 4>whether that's a thousand years from </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2012
01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:30.990
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 500 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we keep going,</v>

2013
01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:36.170
<v Speaker 4>were these technologies will eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting into the hands of regular </v>

2014
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:36.960
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we stop that?</v>

2015
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we stop doing is that is the real</v>

2016
01:35:40.951 --> 01:35:43.950
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do we concentrate on mental health?</v>

2017
01:35:43.951 --> 01:35:48.951
<v Speaker 4>Do we concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on getting people to live in harmony and</v>

2018
01:35:50.101 --> 01:35:52.560
<v Speaker 4>peace before we create all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologies?</v>

2019
01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Or do we sort of figure it out as we go </v>
<v Speaker 4>along and have it catch up?</v>

2020
01:35:58.910 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of question.</v>

2021
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2022
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:04.900
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is back to why I had,</v>

2023
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:09.970
<v Speaker 3>was trying to do the transhumanist party</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I'm trying to introduce these </v>

2024
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:11.600
<v Speaker 3>concepts into politics because for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

2025
01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I just was reading an article and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2026
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:18.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average kid can go spend a thousand </v>

2027
01:36:18.311 --> 01:36:20.680
<v Speaker 3>dollars on Ebay and create this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>very professional microbiology lab in </v>

2028
01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:24.971
<v Speaker 3>his bedroom where he could then launch </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially very dangerous diseases if </v>

2029
01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:28.670
<v Speaker 3>he knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought the thousand dollars,</v>

2030
01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:33.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 20 years ago that would have been </v>

2031
01:36:33.671 --> 01:36:35.570
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so no one would have had access to it </v>

2032
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:37.841
<v Speaker 3>except you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are the kinds of things where </v>

2033
01:36:37.841 --> 01:36:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a lot of government </v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies,</v>

2034
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 3>politicians are actually thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just saying,</v>

2035
01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:46.601
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll push that off to some other day </v>

2036
01:36:46.601 --> 01:36:46.601
<v Speaker 3>because it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's really not that crazy anymore.</v>

2037
01:36:46.601 --> 01:36:51.220
<v Speaker 3>What's happening is more and more people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are getting more and more access to </v>

2038
01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:53.150
<v Speaker 3>power and that's why hackers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2039
01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:58.151
<v Speaker 3>might be able to at some point in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future bring down entire systems if </v>

2040
01:36:58.151 --> 01:36:59.400
<v Speaker 3>they're able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2041
01:36:59.420 --> 01:36:59.880
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2042
01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:02.630
<v Speaker 3>your questions on how do we stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we try to make everyone,</v>

2043
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in harmony.</v>

2044
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big believer that because to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make them live in harmony is probably </v>

2045
01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.740
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've tried that for ages,</v>

2046
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>programs that make everyone live better.</v>

2047
01:37:14.571 --> 01:37:16.520
<v Speaker 3>We're too competitive as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a species.</v>

2048
01:37:16.521 --> 01:37:21.521
<v Speaker 3>I think you need to use technology to </v>
<v Speaker 3>not only advance the species but sort of</v>

2049
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:23.930
<v Speaker 3>to protect the species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

2050
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:26.520
<v Speaker 3>this is difficult because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try,</v>

2051
01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I try to hold some libertarian values </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those values include not impeding a </v>

2052
01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not impeding the right to use the things</v>

2053
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:36.890
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

2054
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:41.890
<v Speaker 3>But I think that technology can really </v>
<v Speaker 3>help guide us if we use it.</v>

2055
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone talks about surveillance </v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2056
01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.360
<v Speaker 3>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2057
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:48.800
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden we live in this great </v>
<v Speaker 3>surveillance world.</v>

2058
01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:53.801
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything we're doing is tracked and </v>

2059
01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:54.410
<v Speaker 3>watched and there's all these cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is actually,</v>

2060
01:37:54.411 --> 01:37:59.411
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the surveillance has made the </v>

2061
01:37:59.411 --> 01:37:59.990
<v Speaker 3>world safer and better for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2062
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:01.710
<v Speaker 3>for our children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for ourselves.</v>

2063
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.040
<v Speaker 3>And yet we still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of us have the freedoms that I </v>

2064
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:07.040
<v Speaker 3>think we all want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2065
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I still feel like a very free person </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all the time,</v>

2066
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 3>not happy paying taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2067
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.680
<v Speaker 3>everyone else the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is we live in a </v>

2068
01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.691
<v Speaker 3>pretty free world and that's technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>has made it safer at the same time </v>

2069
01:38:18.811 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 3>without really compromising our </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedoms.</v>

2070
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I think we can continue going down that </v>
<v Speaker 3>path where we can use technology to </v>

2071
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:31.550
<v Speaker 3>continue to monitor people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a monitor the kinds of things that make </v>

2072
01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it very dangerous for an individual to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

2073
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a subtype of power in his hands that we </v>

2074
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:39.320
<v Speaker 3>can remake universities or whatever.</v>

2075
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Or just the microbiology lab where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>creates a virus and then releases it </v>

2076
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:47.211
<v Speaker 3>into the water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can use technology to stop </v>

2077
01:38:47.211 --> 01:38:47.211
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

2078
01:38:47.211 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we can use technology to grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>the species as a whole.</v>

2079
01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a very fine balance because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably going to have to give up some </v>

2080
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.951
<v Speaker 3>freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're probably going to have to accept </v>

2081
01:38:57.951 --> 01:38:57.951
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2082
01:38:57.951 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 3>this idea of absolutely no government or</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of too much government,</v>

2083
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:04.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>governments are going to have to change </v>

2084
01:39:04.611 --> 01:39:07.101
<v Speaker 3>as technology grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology is going to be leading </v>

2085
01:39:07.101 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 3>governments from here on out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tech,</v>

2086
01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it's government's gonna have to look to </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology to find their solutions.</v>

2087
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

2088
01:39:12.091 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 3>let's use technology on occasion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>solve this.</v>

2089
01:39:14.590 --> 01:39:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology is in the driver's seat and I</v>

2090
01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 3>don't think a lot of people realize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2091
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:26.120
<v Speaker 3>They think they're in the driver's seat </v>
<v Speaker 3>or they think we can still control that </v>

2092
01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:26.120
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2093
01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.350
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is our life is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined by the amount of structure </v>

2094
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 3>that progress and technology has put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lives.</v>

2095
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:37.140
<v Speaker 3>It's no escaping it anymore and yet it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>done very good thing.</v>

2096
01:39:37.141 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 3>So I think we need to continue with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put more of our faith into it.</v>

2097
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And that might mean more regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more observance,</v>

2098
01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:49.530
<v Speaker 3>more tracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually we're all going to be </v>

2099
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:49.530
<v Speaker 3>interconnected with chips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of,</v>

2100
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 3>you had mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe in 10 years you'll be able to read</v>

2101
01:39:50.281 --> 01:39:51.780
<v Speaker 3>my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2102
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:54.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently put on some of the,</v>

2103
01:39:54.181 --> 01:39:59.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head reading equipment and done a </v>

2104
01:39:59.181 --> 01:40:01.101
<v Speaker 3>few articles on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brainwave reading stuff is </v>

2105
01:40:01.101 --> 01:40:04.011
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a singularity university professor </v>

2106
01:40:04.011 --> 01:40:04.011
<v Speaker 3>Jose credential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2107
01:40:04.011 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 3>we were at the world future society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Florida a few months ago speaking</v>

2108
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:13.461
<v Speaker 3>together and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so spoken language won't be here in 20 </v>

2109
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:13.461
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2110
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Bice said spoken language won't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did an article on that and he said,</v>

2111
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.200
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brainwave.</v>

2112
01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.420
<v Speaker 3>He works at Singularity University as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor there.</v>

2113
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Any brainwave technology is increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>so quickly in the last two years.</v>

2114
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:28.440
<v Speaker 3>It's jumped in another two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to jump in 10 years.</v>

2115
01:40:28.441 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have the ability and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2116
01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:32.640
<v Speaker 3>just last year or I guess it's about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight months ago,</v>

2117
01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:37.980
<v Speaker 3>a man in a person in India and a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>in France had the telepathy thoughts and</v>

2118
01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.170
<v Speaker 3>they were without saying a word to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

2119
01:40:40.171 --> 01:40:41.880
<v Speaker 3>He said hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other one said Chow.</v>

2120
01:40:41.881 --> 01:40:46.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the start in five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is going to.</v>

2121
01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Can you explain that technology to </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks?</v>

2122
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically it uses this egg </v>

2123
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very complicated word to say,</v>

2124
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:59.041
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just say it's that technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>and essentially the brain creates </v>

2125
01:40:59.041 --> 01:41:03.121
<v Speaker 3>certain types of waves when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain types of thoughts and various </v>

2126
01:41:03.121 --> 01:41:06.810
<v Speaker 3>places of the body and very various </v>
<v Speaker 3>places of the brain and the headgear you</v>

2127
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 3>have can read it and it knows based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithms,</v>

2128
01:41:09.971 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 3>based on a lot of repetitious practices.</v>

2129
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking like fly a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2130
01:41:14.861 --> 01:41:19.861
<v Speaker 3>the army is working on flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters with using these brainwave </v>

2131
01:41:19.861 --> 01:41:19.861
<v Speaker 3>headsets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It nose lift,</v>

2132
01:41:19.861 --> 01:41:24.720
<v Speaker 3>it knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned left and knows turn right based </v>

2133
01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:24.720
<v Speaker 3>on the soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 3>repeated like saying okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Experimenting and saying okay,</v>

2135
01:41:26.441 --> 01:41:31.441
<v Speaker 3>this always means the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've put it so good together that </v>

2136
01:41:31.441 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 3>they know when you say hello and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know when you say goodbye now.</v>

2137
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:38.460
<v Speaker 3>And if you can send that to another </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and then it can stimulate that </v>

2138
01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.710
<v Speaker 3>person the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's able to an a very basic level right</v>

2139
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:46.711
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell that person that what you feel or </v>

2140
01:41:46.711 --> 01:41:46.711
<v Speaker 3>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you actually said,</v>

2141
01:41:46.711 --> 01:41:49.810
<v Speaker 3>except it comes through in that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your thoughts and I'm not,</v>

2142
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it very eloquently,</v>

2143
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:56.881
<v Speaker 3>but that's the basic structure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is eventually we'll have </v>

2144
01:41:57.491 --> 01:42:02.491
<v Speaker 3>signals going in and signals coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ultimately can make us here these </v>

2145
01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:04.540
<v Speaker 3>things in our head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2146
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're hearing stuff in her head </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2147
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:11.221
<v Speaker 3>but we're doing through our senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we bypass the census and just go </v>

2148
01:42:11.221 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 3>right to the neurons and stimulate them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the same thing.</v>

2149
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:14.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's essentially what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do with that,</v>

2150
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 3>with that type of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very primitive right now,</v>

2151
01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:23.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's growing so fast and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge amount of people that think the </v>

2152
01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 3>brainwave reading headsets will become </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next iphone technology,</v>

2153
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.770
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2154
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.980
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do we need an iphone when you can </v>

2155
01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:31.980
<v Speaker 3>just wear this little device in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and you're like,</v>

2156
01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.480
<v Speaker 3>tell your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2157
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 3>tell your wife this or tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2158
01:42:34.901 --> 01:42:37.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to take out pizza here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to reserve a flight,</v>

2159
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have Siri that's going to</v>

2160
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:44.670
<v Speaker 3>be much more improved in a few years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things will be digitally just </v>

2161
01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 3>done through your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2162
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:51.450
<v Speaker 3>this singularity professor who I totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe said we probably won't be </v>

2163
01:42:52.421 --> 01:42:54.240
<v Speaker 3>speaking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll be at,</v>

2164
01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 3>we'll be at a conference and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be plugged in and you'll be </v>

2165
01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.140
<v Speaker 3>thinking these things because it's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier just to think it and you know,</v>

2166
01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 3>and is that different than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing right now with our headsets,</v>

2167
01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ears,</v>

2168
01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:07.150
<v Speaker 3>the interface.</v>

2169
01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:12.150
<v Speaker 3>But if you just go right to brainwaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stimulate those places in the brain </v>

2170
01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 3>that know how to recognize it will learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new form of communication.</v>

2171
01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>My article is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2172
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:21.690
<v Speaker 3>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we'll need second languages </v>

2173
01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:23.440
<v Speaker 3>because google translate already </v>
<v Speaker 3>translates things instantaneously.</v>

2174
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:28.740
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I suffered through six years of </v>

2175
01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Spanish and I've been working on trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to teach my daughter Chinese and Spanish</v>

2176
01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 3>right now and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

2177
01:43:30.611 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 3>and are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2178
01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:32.320
<v Speaker 3>we must go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I said,</v>

2179
01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:34.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we really need to,</v>

2180
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.240
<v Speaker 3>what if we all have headsets that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>instant translations with anyone on the </v>

2181
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:39.910
<v Speaker 3>planet through our thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2182
01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:41.590
<v Speaker 3>and this is the kind of thinking where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2183
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:46.591
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real transunion thinking because </v>

2184
01:43:46.591 --> 01:43:46.591
<v Speaker 3>maybe all second languages will die out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will.</v>

2185
01:43:46.591 --> 01:43:50.310
<v Speaker 3>We'll just go to one language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my book I talk about bond,</v>

2186
01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:55.530
<v Speaker 3>which is there's various types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages out there that are better for </v>

2187
01:43:55.530 --> 01:44:00.280
<v Speaker 3>communicating a scientific ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical ideas and they don't consider,</v>

2188
01:44:00.861 --> 01:44:05.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>English has all sorts of imperfections </v>

2189
01:44:05.861 --> 01:44:06.740
<v Speaker 3>in it and that's why it's sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to learn in.</v>

2190
01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Most languages have imperfections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a couple of scientists have worked </v>

2191
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.060
<v Speaker 3>on other forms of languages that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more easier,</v>

2192
01:44:14.061 --> 01:44:16.460
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to program into a computer.</v>

2193
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:21.910
<v Speaker 3>There's types of languages that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer can process a lot more simply </v>

2194
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2195
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:27.250
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to teach a computer a </v>

2196
01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:29.250
<v Speaker 3>language and because you know there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists and a masculine types of </v>

2197
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:33.560
<v Speaker 3>endings and things like that that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>trick things if they're irregular,</v>

2198
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 3>but certain languages don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>irregular things.</v>

2199
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And so scientists worked on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>

2200
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that eventually we might</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrive in 20 years at a perfect language</v>

2201
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:47.530
<v Speaker 3>that we'll all use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be our communication will be a lot </v>

2202
01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:47.530
<v Speaker 3>quicker and more expedient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simpler,</v>

2203
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.480
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll all be done through brainwaves and</v>

2204
01:44:50.481 --> 01:44:50.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2205
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:52.310
<v Speaker 3>the world will be a very different </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2206
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of it without just one single </v>

2207
01:44:57.370 --> 01:44:57.370
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just thinking about things.</v>

2208
01:44:57.370 --> 01:44:58.940
<v Speaker 3>So it'll be some sort of tower of Babel </v>
<v Speaker 3>type shit.</v>

2209
01:44:58.941 --> 01:45:03.510
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have that inside of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>head with some technological</v>

2210
01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Lee created translation device that </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows us to utilize this universal </v>

2211
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:11.810
<v Speaker 4>language that computers create.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2212
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I feel so dumb just listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2213
01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 4>my mouth is starting to unconsciously</v>

2214
01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:20.200
<v Speaker 3>go slack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glazing over and I talk about it,</v>

2215
01:45:20.201 --> 01:45:22.870
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know any of the ins and outs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it because the kind of,</v>

2216
01:45:22.871 --> 01:45:27.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question of like how technically do </v>

2217
01:45:27.871 --> 01:45:29.731
<v Speaker 3>they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The scientists that are working on this </v>

2218
01:45:29.731 --> 01:45:31.270
<v Speaker 3>have spent their entire lives on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other scientists that are trying</v>

2219
01:45:31.271 --> 01:45:33.370
<v Speaker 3>to look into it don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>

2220
01:45:33.371 --> 01:45:36.640
<v Speaker 3>And they're experts on it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have people like myself discussing it's,</v>

2221
01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:38.440
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2222
01:45:38.710 --> 01:45:40.240
<v Speaker 3>it's true that it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2223
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I think the more important thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're developing these things and </v>

2224
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:46.080
<v Speaker 3>especially these brainwave reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies.</v>

2225
01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:49.150
<v Speaker 3>There's now a number of companies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are selling it and I'm sure at the local</v>

2226
01:45:49.151 --> 01:45:50.800
<v Speaker 3>target and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2227
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:51.970
<v Speaker 3>that's already here.</v>

2228
01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.240
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is so crazy.</v>

2229
01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.760
<v Speaker 4>But she's so hard to wrap their mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the potential of something like </v>

2230
01:46:04.651 --> 01:46:05.240
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

2231
01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:06.510
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2232
01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:09.630
<v Speaker 4>if you think about like what originally </v>
<v Speaker 4>what Morse code was,</v>

2233
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:10.620
<v Speaker 3>did he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

2234
01:46:10.621 --> 01:46:11.120
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

2235
01:46:11.121 --> 01:46:11.780
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

2236
01:46:11.781 --> 01:46:12.110
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

2237
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:17.270
<v Speaker 4>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you send a text message and now you can </v>

2238
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.430
<v Speaker 4>talk into your phone and send a text </v>
<v Speaker 4>message.</v>

2239
01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2240
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2241
01:46:19.681 --> 01:46:22.740
<v Speaker 4>they have that google voice thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2242
01:46:22.741 --> 01:46:24.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or uh,</v>

2243
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:26.160
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not google voice,</v>

2244
01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.470
<v Speaker 4>but you could use google voice does </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2245
01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could ask Google questions,</v>

2246
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 4>but I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2247
01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:33.600
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2248
01:46:33.630 --> 01:46:38.630
<v Speaker 4>application on my phone with the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a notepad and I,</v>

2249
01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 4>when I have ideas when I'm in my car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just talked to the phone and it </v>

2250
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:47.811
<v Speaker 4>transcribes it and it's almost perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>except for weird words and it doesn't </v>

2251
01:46:47.811 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 4>understand generally like if you said to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2252
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:55.730
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on new technology that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that people can see like eagles,</v>

2253
01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.630
<v Speaker 4>it'll do that and make it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

2254
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever messed with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2255
01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:02.050
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen it like,</v>

2256
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:02.580
<v Speaker 4>watch this.</v>

2257
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:06.390
<v Speaker 4>We'll do it right now because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so crazy how good it's gotten.</v>

2258
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Like you just press this little button </v>
<v Speaker 4>right here.</v>

2259
01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Concentrate on new technology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows people to see as well as eagles </v>

2260
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

2261
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely perfect.</v>

2262
01:47:21.210 --> 01:47:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just talked like a normal person I</v>

2263
01:47:24.151 --> 01:47:29.151
<v Speaker 4>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I would normally if I was trying </v>

2264
01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:29.151
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2265
01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:32.180
<v Speaker 4>send a message to someone who was trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to communicate to someone and it takes </v>

2266
01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:32.180
<v Speaker 4>it and it's doing it right now while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>

2267
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>

2268
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:35.840
<v Speaker 4>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2269
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:40.850
<v Speaker 4>you should type in the Google the mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waive reading post photos to twitter,</v>

2270
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:47.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they now have devices where you can </v>

2271
01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:49.161
<v Speaker 4>actually post directly to twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook by thinking it based on those </v>

2272
01:47:49.161 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 4>devices I was just telling you about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2273
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:55.500
<v Speaker 4>My thought was the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>Morse code,</v>

2274
01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 4>which they created a language teacher </v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

2275
01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:58.710
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

2276
01:47:58.711 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it it,</v>

2277
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.890
<v Speaker 4>they had to create a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds that may mean an ass,</v>

2278
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of sounds that mean a </v>
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

2279
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was all these different or an o </v>

2280
01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:10.280
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>

2281
01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.920
<v Speaker 4>There's all these different sounds that </v>
<v Speaker 4>correspond with letters and then you had</v>

2282
01:48:13.471 --> 01:48:18.471
<v Speaker 4>a piece that together and create a </v>
<v Speaker 4>language out of it or create a word out </v>

2283
01:48:18.471 --> 01:48:20.280
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're able to just say the word and</v>

2284
01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:25.281
<v Speaker 4>it transcribes it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but eventually if this technology comes </v>

2285
01:48:25.281 --> 01:48:28.341
<v Speaker 4>to fruition and you'll have a thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that thought will be transcribed to </v>

2286
01:48:28.341 --> 01:48:29.610
<v Speaker 4>a universal language that someone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

2287
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 4>someone in Zaire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in South America,</v>

2288
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:36.990
<v Speaker 4>anyone anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what they speak,</v>

2289
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:42.650
<v Speaker 4>we'll use this language and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible that there won't be any other </v>

2290
01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:43.980
<v Speaker 4>languages other than this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2291
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 4>like we used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cursive used to be standard.</v>

2292
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:49.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had alert at growing up,</v>

2293
01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kids don't know it.</v>

2294
01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:57.050
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My daughter is six and they don't teach </v>

2295
01:48:57.050 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 4>cursive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gone and they're going to typing </v>

2296
01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.620
<v Speaker 4>will be gone to typing.</v>

2297
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Probably by the time my 11 month old </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets to six.</v>

2298
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering if they're going to even </v>
<v Speaker 4>do typing because a lot of it will </v>

2299
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:12.840
<v Speaker 4>eventually just be what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>verbally speaking or thinking,</v>

2300
01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:13.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2301
01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:15.210
<v Speaker 4>and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

2302
01:49:15.211 --> 01:49:18.570
<v Speaker 4>All these technologies that we thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>were so breakthrough eventually get to a</v>

2303
01:49:18.571 --> 01:49:20.430
<v Speaker 4>point when they're so obsolete and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

2304
01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:25.700
<v Speaker 4>and then you try to tell a younger </v>
<v Speaker 4>person what it was like and they just </v>

2305
01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:25.920
<v Speaker 4>look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

2306
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a voice navigation system on</v>

2307
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:31.360
<v Speaker 4>your car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2308
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:33.870
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just use everything on my iphone.</v>

2309
01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:36.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm for a transhumanist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not very,</v>

2310
01:49:36.241 --> 01:49:38.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high tech with that side,</v>

2311
01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.530
<v Speaker 4>just like talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2312
01:49:40.531 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 4>but I don't actually have that much </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology in my house.</v>

2313
01:49:43.411 --> 01:49:45.000
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't even have a television.</v>

2314
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.120
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a television now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2315
01:49:48.121 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 4>we just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you watch TV then?</v>

2316
01:49:50.210 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a TV.</v>

2317
01:49:51.821 --> 01:49:55.450
<v Speaker 4>We just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we watched dvds and stuff like that on a</v>

2318
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:56.360
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2319
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 4>we have a big giant screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just don't,</v>

2320
01:49:58.811 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 4>we have no TV whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even local access.</v>

2321
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

2322
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:07.420
<v Speaker 4>So you have a big TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just don't have cable or satellite.</v>

2323
01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with the Internet we just use the </v>

2324
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Internet for everything and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like.</v>

2325
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.050
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because I think TV is one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things where for 30,</v>

2326
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:19.120
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years it was such a mainstay and then</v>

2327
01:50:19.121 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden you're trying to teach </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids and say,</v>

2328
01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:24.730
<v Speaker 4>well they hear it at school and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2329
01:50:24.731 --> 01:50:27.400
<v Speaker 4>well we don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not nearly necessary anymore,</v>

2330
01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.880
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And eventually I'm not even sure a big </v>

2331
01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:32.880
<v Speaker 4>giant screen TV will be necessary.</v>

2332
01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Might just be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I guess one thing that you carry </v>

2333
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 4>around or an eye and a ipad or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2334
01:50:37.841 --> 01:50:42.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's constantly in flux and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the great thing about it is just </v>

2335
01:50:42.841 --> 01:50:42.841
<v Speaker 4>constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2336
01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:44.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2337
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:49.590
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if will you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if in five years you'll be using a </v>

2338
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:52.171
<v Speaker 4>laptop for what you're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might just be using probably be </v>

2339
01:50:52.171 --> 01:50:54.130
<v Speaker 4>something more projected from a hologram</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that from the ceiling.</v>

2340
01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those and I've seen the,</v>

2341
01:50:56.471 --> 01:50:57.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2342
01:50:57.081 --> 01:51:02.081
<v Speaker 4>the new watches that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on like a little bit of a fitbit </v>

2343
01:51:02.081 --> 01:51:06.541
<v Speaker 4>thing and it projects an image on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrist and you could touch it and play </v>

2344
01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:09.640
<v Speaker 4>with it the same way that you would like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a touchscreen on a,</v>

2345
01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:13.180
<v Speaker 4>on an actual phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this following that I have now,</v>

2346
01:51:13.181 --> 01:51:18.181
<v Speaker 4>I got this big iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have an iphone and I also have this </v>

2347
01:51:18.181 --> 01:51:18.850
<v Speaker 4>big Samsung Galaxy s five.</v>

2348
01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:24.210
<v Speaker 4>And with both of them they're so big and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so good that I oftentimes I go on the </v>

2349
01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:25.330
<v Speaker 4>road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't use a laptop anymore.</v>

2350
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:28.670
<v Speaker 4>I answer all my emails on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Samsung and it's just,</v>

2351
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:33.490
<v Speaker 4>it's plenty big for images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's plenty big for a web surfing.</v>

2352
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:37.090
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I even use a laptop is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the companies make,</v>

2353
01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.120
<v Speaker 4>it's another programs actually work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and sometimes the laptop is </v>

2354
01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 4>the only way to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2355
01:51:42.251 --> 01:51:47.251
<v Speaker 4>with the sock flash and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they do that purposely because they </v>

2356
01:51:47.251 --> 01:51:48.520
<v Speaker 4>want you to buy as many gadgets as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

2357
01:51:48.521 --> 01:51:48.970
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2358
01:51:48.971 --> 01:51:50.590
<v Speaker 4>eventually they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2359
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:51.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2360
01:51:51.451 --> 01:51:56.451
<v Speaker 4>I heard something like 30 years worth of</v>
<v Speaker 4>technology now fits into an iphone,</v>

2361
01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years because you can watch movies on</v>

2362
01:51:58.811 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can music on it,</v>

2363
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:02.530
<v Speaker 4>you can do all your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in math class,</v>

2364
01:52:02.531 --> 01:52:04.570
<v Speaker 4>you can do your calculators and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2365
01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:08.440
<v Speaker 4>And television is now on an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's how small it's gone.</v>

2366
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 4>But I bet another 30 years it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to something you're the size of your</v>

2367
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:14.640
<v Speaker 4>thumbnail and inside your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2368
01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:19.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have all this recording will be </v>

2369
01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:19.750
<v Speaker 4>done with no equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just probably be big giant tables.</v>

2370
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember my first computer,</v>

2371
01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I had some crappy Mac that I bought that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it had a one gigabyte</v>

2372
01:52:26.441 --> 01:52:28.120
<v Speaker 4>hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2373
01:52:28.121 --> 01:52:30.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they existed back then.</v>

2374
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:35.850
<v Speaker 4>I got a computer in 1994 from comp USA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which doesn't even exist anymore.</v>

2375
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:39.730
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty sure it was less than</v>

2376
01:52:39.731 --> 01:52:42.910
<v Speaker 4>one gigabyte.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember in the future I,</v>

2377
01:52:42.911 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>I ordered a computer that had a four </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard drive</v>

2378
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy for getting the </v>

2379
01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:54.461
<v Speaker 1>bites now my phone is a hundred and 28 </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigabytes and it's this little tiny </v>

2380
01:52:54.861 --> 01:52:59.861
<v Speaker 1>narrow thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has a case on it and it's narrow </v>

2381
01:52:59.861 --> 01:52:59.861
<v Speaker 1>and it just slides right into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>

2382
01:52:59.861 --> 01:53:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's got a 128 gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in this one,</v>

2383
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung has cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you slide in new ones,</v>

2384
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:11.360
<v Speaker 1>he can stick in 64 gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>128 gigs.</v>

2385
01:53:11.361 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 1>You can just keep sticking in little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny SD cards.</v>

2386
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:19.450
<v Speaker 1>They're so small and there are 128 gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't even make sense </v>

2387
01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:19.450
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2388
01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:21.610
<v Speaker 1>with the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cloud is definitely where the future</v>

2389
01:53:21.611 --> 01:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2390
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be no more gigabytes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our phones.</v>

2391
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:30.011
<v Speaker 1>Everything will just be interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will all have these floating big giant </v>

2392
01:53:30.011 --> 01:53:31.720
<v Speaker 1>databases above us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I already am,</v>

2393
01:53:31.730 --> 01:53:36.730
<v Speaker 1>use the cloud for a lot of my stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I do a lot of videos and photos </v>

2394
01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:39.110
<v Speaker 1>of the kids and it just adds up too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>space on the actual phone.</v>

2395
01:53:39.610 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realized that,</v>

2396
01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could run programs,</v>

2397
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you can just run entire computers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud now,</v>

2398
01:53:45.190 --> 01:53:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just all about the new programs </v>

2399
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.511
<v Speaker 1>coming out and eventually everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>will just be probably a hologram screen </v>

2400
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:54.490
<v Speaker 1>connected to somewhere way up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2401
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously metaphorical but will be </v>

2402
01:53:59.530 --> 01:54:01.670
<v Speaker 1>interconnected that way without actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>even having much of a device.</v>

2403
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.630
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2404
01:54:04.631 --> 01:54:05.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2405
01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:07.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably five years away that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm speaking about.</v>

2406
01:54:07.701 --> 01:54:12.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the cloud is probably one the </v>

2407
01:54:12.701 --> 01:54:14.771
<v Speaker 1>most heavily invested things of gadget </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that they're trying to do </v>

2408
01:54:14.771 --> 01:54:19.421
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually we'll all be </v>

2409
01:54:19.421 --> 01:54:19.421
<v Speaker 1>interconnected to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did an artificial hearts,</v>

2410
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an interesting story because </v>

2411
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:27.221
<v Speaker 1>they just did the second completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>robotic artificial heart surgery on a </v>

2412
01:54:27.221 --> 01:54:31.301
<v Speaker 1>patient in France and robotic hearts </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been around for 10 or 15 years or </v>

2413
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 20.</v>

2414
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:34.080
<v Speaker 1>But they were always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2415
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:37.190
<v Speaker 1>a way to keep someone alive until they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a transplant heart,</v>

2416
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:40.850
<v Speaker 1>but they're now starting to do robotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearts that replace the real heart.</v>

2417
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:46.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only heart that person's </v>

2418
01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:46.180
<v Speaker 1>going to have for the rest of his life </v>
<v Speaker 1>or her life.</v>

2419
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so far been two guys and I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've just,</v>

2420
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:55.361
<v Speaker 1>in the last 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've crossed that with now robotic </v>

2421
01:54:55.361 --> 01:54:56.210
<v Speaker 1>hearts are no longer just a temporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement.</v>

2422
01:54:56.211 --> 01:55:01.160
<v Speaker 1>They are the final replacement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all Wifi,</v>

2423
01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:02.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2424
01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.830
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have wifi.</v>

2425
01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Things about in my article is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be in a fight,</v>

2426
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you could pump up your heart with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone,</v>

2427
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:12.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the ring and then you could</v>

2428
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:16.070
<v Speaker 1>fight that much better if I'm a surfer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and big waves or if you want to meditate</v>

2429
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 1>or sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2430
01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you could put it to sleep.</v>

2431
01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're heart goes slower,</v>

2432
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:24.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of these are the ways you're </v>

2433
01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:24.970
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology in your life.</v>

2434
01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting thing I found about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2435
01:55:25.851 --> 01:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2436
01:55:26.541 --> 01:55:31.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story I did was Dick Cheney or the </v>

2437
01:55:31.541 --> 01:55:34.571
<v Speaker 1>former vice president had this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>little device that was attached to one </v>

2438
01:55:34.571 --> 01:55:34.571
<v Speaker 1>of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2439
01:55:34.571 --> 01:55:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the valves in his heart and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you'd read,</v>

2440
01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:40.730
<v Speaker 1>but he was actually afraid of terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks because that was wifi controlled</v>

2441
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:43.190
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an episode of homeland.</v>

2442
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know they used that kind of technology </v>

2443
01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>to hack into someone's heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the technology is coming.</v>

2444
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:54.561
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to start doing that </v>

2445
01:55:54.561 --> 01:55:54.561
<v Speaker 1>and when people are actually really </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about that kind of stuff too,</v>

2446
01:55:54.561 --> 01:55:58.260
<v Speaker 1>it's actually here today and I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2447
01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just a totally brave new world.</v>

2448
01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:05.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's also pretty awesome because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of the possibilities of </v>

2449
01:56:05.210 --> 01:56:06.300
<v Speaker 1>having a robotic heart and now you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

2450
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:07.520
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2451
01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a go free diving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like free diving and you want to go </v>

2452
01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:13.500
<v Speaker 1>down as far as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple hundred feet.</v>

2453
01:56:13.810 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of time you could </v>

2454
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>program your heart to actually work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2455
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to sleep or do yoga or even </v>

2456
01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:23.240
<v Speaker 1>have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2457
01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.630
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you could program your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart to be a different person than you </v>

2458
01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 1>might've been normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2459
01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:32.260
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things in trance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transcendental man where they were </v>

2460
01:56:32.851 --> 01:56:37.851
<v Speaker 1>talking about the potential using </v>
<v Speaker 1>nanobots or artificial blood cells,</v>

2461
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 1>the you'd be able to hold your breath </v>
<v Speaker 1>under water for an hour,</v>

2462
01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.380
<v Speaker 1>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2463
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:46.080
<v Speaker 1>just using these artificial blood cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get created.</v>

2464
01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:53.091
<v Speaker 1>This last year was one of the big things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that where they now have some kind </v>

2466
01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:53.670
<v Speaker 1>of injection when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2467
01:56:53.671 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 1>someone has a been a drought for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and they can inject it into your</v>

2468
01:56:58.021 --> 01:57:03.021
<v Speaker 1>blood supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the first things that are </v>

2469
01:57:03.021 --> 01:57:03.021
<v Speaker 1>trying to put forth that they can now do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in an accident like that,</v>

2470
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but it works in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're allows you to hold oxygen in your </v>

2471
01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>body a lot longer than you normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have.</v>

2472
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2473
01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:16.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my very first opening articles </v>

2474
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:16.060
<v Speaker 1>after the book was on the transhumanist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>

2475
01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:21.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is this idea that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having so many strict regulations </v>

2476
01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:26.061
<v Speaker 1>regarding drug control and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology you can use during real </v>

2477
01:57:26.061 --> 01:57:27.700
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not make it competition where you,</v>

2478
01:57:27.701 --> 01:57:31.170
<v Speaker 1>anything goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're weightlifters can use any types of</v>

2479
01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:33.450
<v Speaker 1>enhancers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2480
01:57:33.451 --> 01:57:38.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and athletes can use any type of </v>

2481
01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 1>technology they get their hands on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2482
01:57:38.671 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy because,</v>

2483
01:57:39.691 --> 01:57:41.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did this thing with,</v>

2484
01:57:41.490 --> 01:57:43.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2485
01:57:43.141 --> 01:57:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the oxygen cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all swim races will be underwater.</v>

2486
01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's considered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2487
01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:50.430
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2488
01:57:50.431 --> 01:57:55.431
<v Speaker 1>one can go underwater long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why sometimes when you see </v>

2489
01:57:55.431 --> 01:57:55.431
<v Speaker 1>backstrokers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a swimmer.</v>

2490
01:57:55.431 --> 01:57:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They kick as far as they can under water</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can go faster.</v>

2491
01:57:57.211 --> 01:58:02.211
<v Speaker 1>There's less resistance problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can hold their breath long </v>

2492
01:58:02.211 --> 01:58:02.211
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of a sudden,</v>

2493
01:58:02.211 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 1>if you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could change the face of swimming.</v>

2494
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing can happen with </v>

2495
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:08.990
<v Speaker 1>almost any sport that you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially powerlifting,</v>

2496
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:11.460
<v Speaker 1>when you actually need a burst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

2497
01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>instead of lifting what they're lifting </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2498
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:17.991
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to lift three or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>times that with steroids that are just </v>

2499
01:58:17.991 --> 01:58:19.320
<v Speaker 1>designed for it to give you 10 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just pure rage.</v>

2500
01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.450
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for in competition,</v>

2501
01:58:24.451 --> 01:58:29.451
<v Speaker 1>what we look for in sports is someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcending the ability of the average </v>

2502
01:58:29.451 --> 01:58:33.651
<v Speaker 1>person with discipline and focus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive and will that they work really </v>

2503
01:58:35.011 --> 01:58:37.950
<v Speaker 1>hard and concentrate really hard on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their technique.</v>

2504
01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And then they get to some point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there a Michael Jordan or some</v>

2505
01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Olympic power lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could just program it in,</v>

2506
01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:50.251
<v Speaker 4>what would be the point of watching it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would like to eliminate a lot of the </v>

2507
01:58:50.251 --> 01:58:54.570
<v Speaker 4>really magical moments in sport because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to create a bunch of super </v>

2508
01:58:54.570 --> 01:58:55.360
<v Speaker 4>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on the other hand,</v>

2509
01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.250
<v Speaker 4>if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2510
01:58:57.251 --> 01:59:02.251
<v Speaker 4>my take on it is going to be that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to manipulate </v>

2511
01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:04.980
<v Speaker 4>biological bodies in a way where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to literally create an </v>

2512
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:11.251
<v Speaker 4>incredible hulk like someone is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be that and if we're watching athletes </v>

2513
01:59:11.251 --> 01:59:13.600
<v Speaker 4>that are totally natural and have all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these limitations,</v>

2514
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:16.450
<v Speaker 4>but your mailman can jump over your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking house.</v>

2515
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Like we're going to be bored with </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular sports.</v>

2516
01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:25.020
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to have the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But W who is going to watch football if </v>

2517
01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:25.560
<v Speaker 4>everybody's the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2518
01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have a team of 16 hulks on</v>
<v Speaker 4>one side and 16 hawks and the other and </v>

2519
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:33.160
<v Speaker 4>it's all about moving a ball across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

2520
01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:38.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a fucking world are we </v>

2521
01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:38.160
<v Speaker 4>going to be living in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's,</v>

2522
01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from just even a commercial perspective.</v>

2523
01:59:39.701 --> 01:59:44.701
<v Speaker 4>That's why I liked the idea of having </v>
<v Speaker 4>two separate types of sporting </v>

2524
01:59:44.701 --> 01:59:44.701
<v Speaker 4>endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

2525
01:59:44.701 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 4>you have the stuff we have now because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally agree with you.</v>

2526
01:59:47.231 --> 01:59:50.290
<v Speaker 4>I've been an athlete my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did water polo through college and stuff</v>

2527
01:59:50.291 --> 01:59:52.180
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is,</v>

2528
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole point of it is that I worked </v>

2529
01:59:57.450 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 4>my butt off and I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was good at it,</v>

2530
01:59:57.450 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>

2531
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:02.730
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of cheating if someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets to take a drug just because the </v>

2532
02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 4>scientists developed it and he had more </v>
<v Speaker 4>money and that,</v>

2533
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:04.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it and then they're better.</v>

2534
02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:09.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think maybe two fields </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be created like one transhumanist </v>

2535
02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Olympics won Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

2536
02:00:10.691 --> 02:00:11.660
<v Speaker 4>sporting cheap.</v>

2537
02:00:12.230 --> 02:00:14.760
<v Speaker 4>The regular people would pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

2538
02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:18.010
<v Speaker 4>not transhumanist cheat mean that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>

2539
02:00:18.011 --> 02:00:22.180
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that was the big argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Lance Armstrong.</v>

2540
02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Lance Armstrong got busted cheating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2541
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:27.340
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took away his tour de France wins,</v>

2542
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:32.580
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to go back to the person</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hasn't tested positive for drugs on</v>

2543
02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.960
<v Speaker 4>the Tour de France,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go back to like 17th place </v>

2544
02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.850
<v Speaker 4>because everybody was cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it gets to this point where like,</v>

2545
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:46.450
<v Speaker 4>is it cheating and everybody's cheating </v>
<v Speaker 4>or is it just some unfortunate aspect of</v>

2546
02:00:46.451 --> 02:00:51.010
<v Speaker 4>this competition that people don't admit</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they need to do in order to be able</v>

2547
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:52.450
<v Speaker 4>to race like this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2548
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:57.510
<v Speaker 4>I think everything will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do go the transhumanist </v>

2549
02:00:57.510 --> 02:01:00.460
<v Speaker 4>competition route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was sort of become like race </v>

2550
02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 4>car competition where you have a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good driver but then you have engineers </v>

2551
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.900
<v Speaker 4>behind him that make the vehicle so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can get that far.</v>

2552
02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:13.130
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of the cool thing is </v>

2553
02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:14.971
<v Speaker 4>like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he has this engineer from Porsche </v>

2554
02:01:14.971 --> 02:01:17.221
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they become sort of celebrities or </v>

2555
02:01:17.221 --> 02:01:17.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the transhumanist Olympics world,</v>

2556
02:01:17.221 --> 02:01:20.050
<v Speaker 4>I think scientists would maybe become </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrities as much as,</v>

2557
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:23.110
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become popular figures because you would</v>

2558
02:01:23.111 --> 02:01:23.710
<v Speaker 4>really say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2559
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.040
<v Speaker 4>he's the one who made this athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the athlete and this athlete do all </v>

2560
02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:29.880
<v Speaker 4>those records.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it would be kind of different.</v>

2561
02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:33.370
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe even a different word </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be used.</v>

2562
02:01:33.371 --> 02:01:38.371
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be sports anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be something new because it </v>

2563
02:01:38.371 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 4>would be something so different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would be taking the coaches and the</v>

2564
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.550
<v Speaker 3>engineers and scientists behind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete to a whole nother level.</v>

2565
02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would that be?</v>

2566
02:01:47.111 --> 02:01:52.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of what we love about </v>

2567
02:01:52.111 --> 02:01:53.380
<v Speaker 4>sports is the fact that we know it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to become a great athlete.</v>

2568
02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:58.270
<v Speaker 4>It involves like the dedication of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to the movie rocky.</v>

2569
02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things that people loved</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it was that he got up when he was </v>

2570
02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:03.420
<v Speaker 4>tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hit that alarm clock.</v>

2571
02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.680
<v Speaker 4>He drank the raw eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went jogging,</v>

2572
02:02:05.681 --> 02:02:10.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing all these things that he </v>

2573
02:02:10.681 --> 02:02:12.151
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to do to push his body to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reach this level of fitness that allowed</v>

2574
02:02:12.701 --> 02:02:16.250
<v Speaker 4>him to go and fight Apollo creed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2575
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.400
<v Speaker 4>a guy who really was out of his league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He rose the occasion with hardwell and </v>

2576
02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:26.281
<v Speaker 4>to heart and will and determination and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard work that that's what excites us </v>

2577
02:02:27.191 --> 02:02:31.450
<v Speaker 4>about sports is that we know it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do if it becomes easy to do.</v>

2578
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean if the average person can go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some transhumanism clinic and get a shot</v>

2579
02:02:35.921 --> 02:02:38.590
<v Speaker 4>of nanobots and become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2580
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:40.420
<v Speaker 4>some ultra man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2581
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:45.510
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some person that has capabilities far </v>

2582
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:48.050
<v Speaker 4>beyond your normal biological body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2583
02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:49.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we might lose interest.</v>

2584
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.830
<v Speaker 4>We might lose interest.</v>

2585
02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:52.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2586
02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:53.080
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2587
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:58.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is what you said and you </v>

2588
02:02:58.090 --> 02:02:58.090
<v Speaker 3>nailed right on the head when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2589
02:02:58.090 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do in the mail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man is a better basketball player than </v>

2590
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because he's on these,</v>

2591
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:04.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's taking these things or you know,</v>

2592
02:03:05.070 --> 02:03:07.920
<v Speaker 3>a 10 year old who puts on a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>exoskeleton suit,</v>

2593
02:03:07.921 --> 02:03:10.530
<v Speaker 3>just runs as faster than a horse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2594
02:03:10.531 --> 02:03:15.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what if you're in </v>

2595
02:03:15.531 --> 02:03:15.531
<v Speaker 3>Olympia Olympia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sprinter it,</v>

2596
02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but aren't sports kind of silly in that </v>

2597
02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:21.230
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're concentrating on this,</v>

2598
02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:26.010
<v Speaker 3>this thing that we talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this competition aspect of our lives,</v>

2599
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:30.410
<v Speaker 3>but if we reached some incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent point in,</v>

2600
02:03:30.411 --> 02:03:30.970
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the</v>

2601
02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:33.270
<v Speaker 4>physical abilities of people because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology,</v>

2602
02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.550
<v Speaker 4>does it really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sport really matter anymore.</v>

2603
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's kind of a silly thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on about this being the one </v>

2604
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:44.211
<v Speaker 4>thing that we're going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who gives a shit if that ball goes </v>

2605
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:44.211
<v Speaker 4>in that net,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2606
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:45.730
<v Speaker 4>he made a basket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

2607
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Does it really change the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2608
02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Or is it far more impressive that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average person no longer has the </v>

2609
02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:54.630
<v Speaker 4>limitations that the biological body?</v>

2610
02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2611
02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2612
02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I think to some extent probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2613
02:03:59.410 --> 02:04:01.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess when we care for,</v>

2614
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think sports will fade away </v>
<v Speaker 3>because sports has become one of the </v>

2615
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>greatest methods that people use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become great,</v>

2616
02:04:09.371 --> 02:04:14.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's one of the inspiring events </v>

2617
02:04:14.371 --> 02:04:16.891
<v Speaker 3>that we have as a species that brings us</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and so it's hard to see that </v>

2618
02:04:16.891 --> 02:04:21.001
<v Speaker 3>going away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess if everyone has access to </v>

2619
02:04:21.001 --> 02:04:23.641
<v Speaker 3>this incredible technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may not be necessarily like so </v>

2620
02:04:23.641 --> 02:04:24.670
<v Speaker 3>involved in it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2621
02:04:24.671 --> 02:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>the Super Bowl is one of America's big </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant events.</v>

2622
02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really understand why it's that </v>

2623
02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:32.520
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2624
02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.270
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to see that changing anytime </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon.</v>

2625
02:04:34.271 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Even if we get really crazy access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology somehow that's become</v>

2626
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>kind of part of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2627
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>this type of competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

2628
02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2629
02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors that we do.</v>

2630
02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.310
<v Speaker 1>The World Cup just came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that was like when,</v>

2631
02:04:49.311 --> 02:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>when do you actually have so many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>all thinking of the same thing?</v>

2632
02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't like steroids and you know,</v>

2633
02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:00.540
<v Speaker 1>and even supplements to that to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain extent,</v>

2634
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>aren't they essentially look low level </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering of the human body.</v>

2635
02:05:04.951 --> 02:05:09.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a low level genetic </v>

2636
02:05:09.951 --> 02:05:12.711
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you're doing when </v>

2637
02:05:12.711 --> 02:05:14.751
<v Speaker 1>you're adding steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're adding a chemical to a system </v>

2638
02:05:14.751 --> 02:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that forces that system perform and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplary matter.</v>

2639
02:05:15.871 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>That's really not possible without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>

2640
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Now it's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally fine.</v>

2641
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2642
02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>They may say it's unnatural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is unnatural?</v>

2643
02:05:24.961 --> 02:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean in today's Day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is on natural shit.</v>

2644
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Everything's on natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2645
02:05:29.991 --> 02:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean every grading it.</v>

2646
02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you will.</v>

2647
02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2648
02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>from a certain perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is kind of like,</v>

2649
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it comes from certain elements,</v>

2650
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

2651
02:05:39.811 --> 02:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use it.</v>

2652
02:05:40.801 --> 02:05:42.920
<v Speaker 1>What if you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's useful and functional,</v>

2653
02:05:42.921 --> 02:05:47.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't everything that human beings </v>

2654
02:05:47.921 --> 02:05:49.401
<v Speaker 1>create?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact natural because we are natural </v>

2655
02:05:49.401 --> 02:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>and we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a built in curiosity and a built</v>

2656
02:05:50.311 --> 02:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>in thirst and hunger for innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

2657
02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much different is that than a </v>

2658
02:05:58.620 --> 02:05:59.460
<v Speaker 1>natural animal that for just for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is what they do.</v>

2659
02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is natural that they dig a hole in </v>

2660
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the ground and find the routes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for,</v>

2661
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:06.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals that they want to eat.</v>

2662
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:08.430
<v Speaker 1>All these things are natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I invest.</v>

2663
02:06:08.431 --> 02:06:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Why I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been.</v>

2664
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2665
02:06:10.711 --> 02:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>so zoltan the transhumanism stuff you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is so unnatural.</v>

2666
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I say actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's potentially the most natural thing </v>

2667
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.750
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have done.</v>

2668
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Becoming robots might actually be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly natural process,</v>

2669
02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for human beings one day.</v>

2670
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2671
02:06:27.121 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's evolution.</v>

2672
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So how can it not be a natural thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2673
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all perception.</v>

2674
02:06:32.850 --> 02:06:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And if people want to twist it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2675
02:06:34.591 --> 02:06:39.591
<v Speaker 1>it's just too weird for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in any way that it's just too </v>

2676
02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:39.591
<v Speaker 1>weird for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in any,</v>

2677
02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:43.080
<v Speaker 1>like big statements saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural for us to transform ourselves.</v>

2678
02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Whether we're creating steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we're putting microchips inside </v>

2679
02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.471
<v Speaker 1>her head or whether we're just putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>on an exoskeleton suit and climbing </v>

2680
02:06:51.471 --> 02:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

2681
02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always going to be natural </v>

2682
02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.181
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish people would see that technology </v>

2683
02:06:59.181 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 1>more as a natural phenomenon rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>some type of like,</v>

2684
02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>outside thing that comes in as an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we're slowly started using,</v>

2685
02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you had told someone a </v>

2686
02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>century go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2687
02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:14.841
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to be interconnected on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell phone and this and this </v>

2688
02:07:14.841 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 1>internet and we're going to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>video conferencing across the oceans.</v>

2689
02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would have looked at you and said</v>

2690
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>he's got mental problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2691
02:07:20.421 --> 02:07:22.590
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now everyone does it.</v>

2692
02:07:22.591 --> 02:07:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2693
02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I know they have cell phones and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poorest villages in Africa.</v>

2694
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible how far it's come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2695
02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing unnatural about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in fact,</v>

2696
02:07:32.491 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing stuff that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep getting more</v>

2697
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one thing that gives me the </v>

2698
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:43.141
<v Speaker 4>most hope about technology is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another it will raise up the </v>

2699
02:07:43.141 --> 02:07:47.431
<v Speaker 4>level of the quality of life for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that live in poor areas.</v>

2700
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:52.090
<v Speaker 4>And the cell phone is a perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

2701
02:07:52.091 --> 02:07:56.030
<v Speaker 4>It used to be Gordon Gecko on the beach </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that big ass brick phone in,</v>

2702
02:07:56.031 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Wall Street.</v>

2703
02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2704
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 4>this guy's got access to a phone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's walking on the beach.</v>

2705
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 4>This is super high tech and now you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2706
02:08:04.391 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Brazil and seen people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the favelas,</v>

2707
02:08:07.151 --> 02:08:10.100
<v Speaker 4>in these poor neighborhoods that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phones and have smartphones,</v>

2708
02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:15.180
<v Speaker 4>iphones or android phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is becoming more and more </v>

2709
02:08:15.671 --> 02:08:18.610
<v Speaker 4>prevalent all throughout the world in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa and all these different places.</v>

2710
02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:23.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the quality of life and as far </v>

2711
02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:28.111
<v Speaker 4>as the access to health care as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to communicate with each </v>

2712
02:08:28.111 --> 02:08:31.180
<v Speaker 4>other as far as the access to modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>comforts,</v>

2713
02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.600
<v Speaker 4>that's the one thing that gives me the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most hope about the exponential growth </v>

2714
02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:37.930
<v Speaker 4>of technologies that I hope it elevates.</v>

2715
02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:41.740
<v Speaker 4>The quality of life for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are stuck in the lowest one percent,</v>

2716
02:08:41.741 --> 02:08:42.880
<v Speaker 4>five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 percent,</v>

2717
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:45.700
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That slowly,</v>

2718
02:08:45.701 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 4>that life will be a far better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far less suffering,</v>

2719
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:50.470
<v Speaker 4>far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far,</v>

2720
02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:53.710
<v Speaker 4>far easier existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that they,</v>

2721
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:57.670
<v Speaker 4>in fact with this technology can </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on other things because the,</v>

2722
02:08:57.671 --> 02:09:02.671
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology frees up a lot of </v>

2723
02:09:02.671 --> 02:09:04.261
<v Speaker 4>resources and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it allow them to raise up their quality </v>

2724
02:09:04.261 --> 02:09:04.810
<v Speaker 4>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raise up their education,</v>

2725
02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 4>raise up their healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raise up their government,</v>

2726
02:09:07.511 --> 02:09:10.810
<v Speaker 4>like all of these things will in fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>raise the.</v>

2727
02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:15.070
<v Speaker 4>We look at Africa as a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look at the Congo,</v>

2728
02:09:15.071 --> 02:09:20.071
<v Speaker 4>which is this incredibly rich area in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of resources but incredibly poor </v>

2729
02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.320
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the quality of life for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that lived there.</v>

2730
02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:28.520
<v Speaker 4>And if we could somehow or another raise</v>
<v Speaker 4>that up where like the people that live </v>

2731
02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:33.391
<v Speaker 4>in the Congo have the same quality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life as the people that live in the </v>

2732
02:09:33.391 --> 02:09:33.391
<v Speaker 4>average American city city.</v>

2733
02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:35.200
<v Speaker 4>You would have a radically different </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

2734
02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:37.000
<v Speaker 4>a radically different world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2735
02:09:37.001 --> 02:09:41.320
<v Speaker 4>it would change everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be one of the biggest changes</v>

2736
02:09:41.321 --> 02:09:44.860
<v Speaker 4>that technology brings in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The elevation of the quality of life,</v>

2737
02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 4>of the average person on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2738
02:09:47.501 --> 02:09:49.030
<v Speaker 4>and I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2739
02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:54.360
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the big reasons I'm such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>big proponent or a promoter of the </v>

2740
02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Internet because the one thing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet has done,</v>

2741
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:59.230
<v Speaker 4>I did a huge amount of reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think 13 or 14,</v>

2742
02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:03.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Muslim or Middle Eastern countries for</v>

2743
02:10:03.191 --> 02:10:05.380
<v Speaker 4>National Geographic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to various places and,</v>

2744
02:10:05.381 --> 02:10:06.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2745
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:12.540
<v Speaker 4>the great thing about the Internet is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's offered a sense of democracy and </v>

2746
02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:14.020
<v Speaker 4>even though a lot of those places still </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't really have it.</v>

2747
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 4>This is why we had some of the uprisings</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think recently,</v>

2748
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:20.380
<v Speaker 4>is that you get enough people on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet and they find out things.</v>

2749
02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:21.430
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2750
02:10:21.431 --> 02:10:24.730
<v Speaker 4>this is what some person is doing in Los</v>
<v Speaker 4>Angeles.</v>

2751
02:10:24.731 --> 02:10:29.731
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we do that here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's happened because there's </v>

2752
02:10:29.731 --> 02:10:32.860
<v Speaker 4>computers or cell phones that are slowly</v>
<v Speaker 4>appearing in these places that never had</v>

2753
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:33.620
<v Speaker 4>access to that.</v>

2754
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 3>It's inevitable to stay in your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's kind of some type of </v>

2755
02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:43.691
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have access to that kind of </v>

2756
02:10:43.691 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 3>information because it makes you upset </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're gonna,</v>

2757
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.820
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna revolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's brilliant.</v>

2758
02:10:46.821 --> 02:10:51.821
<v Speaker 3>That's why cell phones are so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just even regarding the malaria </v>

2759
02:10:51.821 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>thing we talked about earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Solomon Islands,</v>

2760
02:10:52.101 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons so many people die </v>
<v Speaker 3>from malaria is they can't get access to</v>

2761
02:10:56.091 --> 02:11:01.091
<v Speaker 3>the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you can call someone and have </v>

2762
02:11:01.091 --> 02:11:03.791
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a healthy person make the walk over the </v>

2763
02:11:03.791 --> 02:11:03.791
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can bring you the drugs.</v>

2764
02:11:03.791 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past there's been no way to call.</v>

2765
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:10.390
<v Speaker 3>There's no telephone lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but cell phones have enabled that to </v>

2766
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:13.631
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cell phones is one of the main reasons </v>

2767
02:11:13.631 --> 02:11:13.631
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of villages in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2768
02:11:13.631 --> 02:11:16.490
<v Speaker 3>a lot of villages in Africa have cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phones for this reason,</v>

2769
02:11:16.491 --> 02:11:21.491
<v Speaker 3>for literally medical reasons so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can come in and take out sick </v>

2770
02:11:21.491 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 3>people when otherwise have to walk days </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to get into,</v>

2771
02:11:25.071 --> 02:11:26.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get them to help.</v>

2772
02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2773
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:32.890
<v Speaker 3>this kind of technology is literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the face of how especially poor</v>

2774
02:11:33.201 --> 02:11:35.690
<v Speaker 3>people live and making them live better </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

2775
02:11:35.691 --> 02:11:38.900
<v Speaker 3>And so that mortality rates are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's getting better.</v>

2776
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.630
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally hopeful that tech.</v>

2777
02:11:41.631 --> 02:11:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2778
02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:45.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big brother for technology,</v>

2779
02:11:45.501 --> 02:11:46.520
<v Speaker 3>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2780
02:11:46.710 --> 02:11:49.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a new world order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of conspiracy theorists had</v>

2781
02:11:49.431 --> 02:11:52.550
<v Speaker 3>always leave me threats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I keep saying that,</v>

2782
02:11:52.551 --> 02:11:53.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you threats,</v>

2783
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:55.220
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they leave me threats because I'm,</v>

2784
02:11:55.221 --> 02:12:00.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now saying a lot of stuff like I </v>

2785
02:12:00.221 --> 02:12:00.500
<v Speaker 3>advocate for using microchips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's heads and,</v>

2786
02:12:00.710 --> 02:12:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and using technology as means to improve</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2787
02:12:03.621 --> 02:12:06.800
<v Speaker 3>but they think it's all part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elite trying to control us.</v>

2788
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>And I always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact is that all people around </v>

2789
02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.631
<v Speaker 3>the world are getting more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to this technology that's </v>

2790
02:12:16.631 --> 02:12:16.670
<v Speaker 3>improving their lives.</v>

2791
02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's what the elite do.</v>

2792
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's a lead behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2793
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>but if that's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's a good thing because it's </v>

2794
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.270
<v Speaker 3>happened that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an elite thing.</v>

2795
02:12:26.271 --> 02:12:31.271
<v Speaker 3>It just happens to be that it costs a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money to develop technology at </v>

2796
02:12:31.271 --> 02:12:32.510
<v Speaker 3>first and it takes a few years to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickle down.</v>

2797
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it takes a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but history has shown that most </v>

2798
02:12:37.570 --> 02:12:41.171
<v Speaker 3>technology has trickled down from </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it came from and that some of </v>

2799
02:12:41.171 --> 02:12:42.710
<v Speaker 3>the poorest people in the world have </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to a,</v>

2800
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:46.670
<v Speaker 3>to a lot of the development that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>come through the pipeline.</v>

2801
02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2802
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 3>a few weeks ago I debated John Zerzan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the leading philosopher of the NRA.</v>

2803
02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of capitalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2804
02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:58.020
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

2805
02:12:58.830 --> 02:13:00.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's based gonna,</v>

2806
02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:05.190
<v Speaker 3>anti civilization philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really advocates for going back to </v>

2807
02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:08.900
<v Speaker 3>entirely primitive lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2808
02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:12.680
<v Speaker 3>we had a debate at Stanford University </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it went well.</v>

2809
02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:13.910
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

2810
02:13:13.911 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he represents kind of the anarchists and</v>

2811
02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:22.210
<v Speaker 3>my book has some anarchist theme so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't completely disassociate myself </v>

2812
02:13:22.210 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 3>from some of the radical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary ideas that are there.</v>

2813
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:30.070
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he advocates for things that would </v>

2814
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:33.630
<v Speaker 3>absolutely harm some of the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the world.</v>

2815
02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Harm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2816
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:39.540
<v Speaker 3>basically everyone by giving up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that have made us live longer and</v>

2817
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:43.170
<v Speaker 3>better when you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife is a doctor,</v>

2818
02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:48.171
<v Speaker 3>so she's done a lot of work in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you take away technology and </v>

2819
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:53.300
<v Speaker 3>medicine and modern science from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2820
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:58.320
<v Speaker 3>especially the poorest people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a very hard time surviving.</v>

2821
02:13:58.321 --> 02:14:03.321
<v Speaker 3>They go right back to the way a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribal people had lived for long times </v>

2822
02:14:03.321 --> 02:14:08.121
<v Speaker 3>where people die from a cavity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people die from the simplest of </v>

2823
02:14:08.121 --> 02:14:08.860
<v Speaker 3>infections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2824
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.310
<v Speaker 3>we now have ways to deal with all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2825
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:14.490
<v Speaker 3>So lifespans are growing grain that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing in America,</v>

2826
02:14:14.491 --> 02:14:19.491
<v Speaker 3>they're growing all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're growing in Africa and they are </v>

2827
02:14:19.491 --> 02:14:20.010
<v Speaker 3>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does this guy want?</v>

2828
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:24.990
<v Speaker 3>What does he want to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like a primitive way of life.</v>

2829
02:14:24.991 --> 02:14:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2830
02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:30.580
<v Speaker 3>So he advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says that all harm came from </v>

2831
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:36.020
<v Speaker 3>basically the development of technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of,</v>

2832
02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:39.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically when we lived in tribes and we</v>

2833
02:14:39.991 --> 02:14:43.710
<v Speaker 3>were in very communal tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were much happier as human beings.</v>

2834
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I've heard this shit so many times </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2835
02:14:45.421 --> 02:14:47.100
<v Speaker 3>It drives me bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's this dude's name?</v>

2836
02:14:47.250 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 3>John Zerzan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spelled Z E R,</v>

2837
02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:55.880
<v Speaker 3>z a n.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we literally just had a big kind of </v>

2838
02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 3>public debate at Stanford University </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

2839
02:14:57.211 --> 02:15:00.060
<v Speaker 3>And it went well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a little bit crazy.</v>

2840
02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:03.210
<v Speaker 3>The NRF has outnumbered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transhumanist in the auditorium,</v>

2841
02:15:03.211 --> 02:15:05.740
<v Speaker 3>like four to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a little bit sketchy actually.</v>

2842
02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The black bloc guys,</v>

2843
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:07.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2844
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:09.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2845
02:15:09.271 --> 02:15:14.271
<v Speaker 3>the guys that go through the Oakland </v>
<v Speaker 3>riots or when you have riots and they </v>

2846
02:15:14.271 --> 02:15:15.120
<v Speaker 3>put it on the black stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black masks and whatnot.</v>

2847
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.430
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2848
02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:17.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you see like the,</v>

2849
02:15:17.691 --> 02:15:21.050
<v Speaker 3>the World Trade Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that kind of go to those,</v>

2850
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:22.710
<v Speaker 3>they're called black black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They usually,</v>

2851
02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:26.400
<v Speaker 3>they try to make themselves completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymous and any was.</v>

2852
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:31.401
<v Speaker 3>There are some of those guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a little bit sketchy because </v>

2853
02:15:31.401 --> 02:15:31.401
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a pretty heated.</v>

2854
02:15:31.401 --> 02:15:36.320
<v Speaker 3>These guys think that all transhumanists</v>
<v Speaker 3>are aiming to turn the world into </v>

2855
02:15:36.841 --> 02:15:39.330
<v Speaker 3>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they actually feel quite angry.</v>

2856
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:40.170
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>

2857
02:15:40.171 --> 02:15:45.171
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to kill us by making us become </v>

2858
02:15:45.171 --> 02:15:46.290
<v Speaker 3>different types of entities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Trans humanists say,</v>

2859
02:15:46.291 --> 02:15:51.291
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys want to kill us by taking us </v>

2860
02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:51.291
<v Speaker 3>back to a domestic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2861
02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:55.080
<v Speaker 3>into this kind of very primitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle where most of us couldn't </v>

2862
02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:55.080
<v Speaker 3>survive because we'd all starve.</v>

2863
02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.600
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough hunter and gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want to hunt.</v>

2864
02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to take us back essentially to</v>

2865
02:15:59.581 --> 02:16:01.960
<v Speaker 3>a hunter and gatherer lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2866
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:03.420
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their platform.</v>

2867
02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 100 percent of their platform,</v>

2868
02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:08.240
<v Speaker 3>the whole world hunter and gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter.</v>

2869
02:16:08.290 --> 02:16:10.830
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent and the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't work with 7 billion.</v>

2870
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:11.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2871
02:16:11.281 --> 02:16:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2872
02:16:12.171 --> 02:16:17.171
<v Speaker 3>they know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet they advocate in the same way that </v>

2873
02:16:17.171 --> 02:16:17.260
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2874
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.880
<v Speaker 3>some people advocate things that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make a point that technology </v>

2875
02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.661
<v Speaker 3>has made human beings unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And our point is that technology has </v>

2876
02:16:26.661 --> 02:16:28.410
<v Speaker 3>made human beings live better and longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and happier.</v>

2877
02:16:28.710 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 3>And so they advocate</v>

2878
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:30.910
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a big,</v>

2879
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 4>pretty big movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2880
02:16:31.991 --> 02:16:33.570
<v Speaker 4>there's certainly a lot bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 4>transhumans.</v>

2881
02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.800
<v Speaker 4>So all these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hunt for their own food.</v>

2882
02:16:35.801 --> 02:16:39.220
<v Speaker 4>They know that vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all hypocrites in that sense.</v>

2883
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:44.430
<v Speaker 4>And because even this is not criticism </v>
<v Speaker 4>of there and there's really no way for,</v>

2884
02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:50.460
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for to even get a Mr Jersey on to a </v>

2885
02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:54.290
<v Speaker 4>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to fly in from Oregon to malaria.</v>

2886
02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:57.340
<v Speaker 4>We use speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wears clothes,</v>

2887
02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 4>but he has a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

2888
02:16:59.321 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 4>John Sears on is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the,</v>

2889
02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:05.670
<v Speaker 4>he was the confidence of the unabomber </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why he.</v>

2890
02:17:05.710 --> 02:17:07.660
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of taken over the unibomber </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

2891
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:09.090
<v Speaker 4>He will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew the unibomber.</v>

2892
02:17:09.170 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 4>He knew he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a good friend of his who was </v>

2893
02:17:14.170 --> 02:17:14.260
<v Speaker 4>there during the entire court </v>
<v Speaker 4>proceedings.</v>

2894
02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:15.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Christ.</v>

2895
02:17:15.461 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 4>So this is why I had a lot of threats </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

2896
02:17:18.101 --> 02:17:23.101
<v Speaker 4>when you're debating him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sorta debating some of the ideas </v>

2897
02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:23.101
<v Speaker 4>of the unibomber who still has a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>following.</v>

2898
02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:24.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UNIBOMBER,</v>

2899
02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:27.190
<v Speaker 4>they screwed his mind up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Harvard Lsd Studies,</v>

2900
02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.990
<v Speaker 4>I actually don't know that much about </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2901
02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2902
02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 4>He was a part of those original lsd </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies and I believe it was the sixties</v>

2903
02:17:35.081 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 4>before they made lsd illegal and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking torched that guy's brain.</v>

2904
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2905
02:17:40.390 --> 02:17:45.390
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harvard did a bunch of series of </v>

2906
02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:48.360
<v Speaker 4>experiments on people with LSD and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>results of those experiments are all </v>

2907
02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.770
<v Speaker 4>classified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a documentary called the net</v>

2908
02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:55.980
<v Speaker 4>that went into great detail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was a German documentary </v>

2909
02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:56.920
<v Speaker 4>that talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very public.</v>

2910
02:17:56.921 --> 02:18:01.921
<v Speaker 4>It's public knowledge that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in the Harvard lsd studies and </v>

2911
02:18:01.921 --> 02:18:04.960
<v Speaker 4>it's very likely that they cooked his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking brain with extraordinary,</v>

2912
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:10.140
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily large doses of Lsd in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these clinical settings and who knows </v>

2913
02:18:10.390 --> 02:18:12.670
<v Speaker 4>what kind of tests they ran on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys and.</v>

2914
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:18.030
<v Speaker 4>But he came out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to Berkeley and made enough money </v>

2915
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:21.010
<v Speaker 4>essentially teaching just to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build this house,</v>

2916
02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:26.130
<v Speaker 4>this little small cabin up in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>and start his plan to murder people who </v>

2917
02:18:26.130 --> 02:18:27.670
<v Speaker 4>were involved in the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

2918
02:18:27.930 --> 02:18:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fact that anybody could leave</v>
<v Speaker 4>out that just look only purely at his </v>

2919
02:18:33.131 --> 02:18:38.131
<v Speaker 4>philosophy and leave out the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they cook this guy's brain on acid and </v>

2920
02:18:38.131 --> 02:18:42.721
<v Speaker 4>who knows what kind of dosages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you go back to some of the </v>

2921
02:18:42.721 --> 02:18:47.701
<v Speaker 4>studies that they did in the 19 fifties </v>
<v Speaker 4>with soldiers and they did studies with </v>

2922
02:18:47.701 --> 02:18:47.701
<v Speaker 4>housewives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2923
02:18:47.701 --> 02:18:51.220
<v Speaker 4>there was varying doses like to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>people a couple,</v>

2924
02:18:51.930 --> 02:18:56.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what would be the average hit,</v>

2925
02:18:56.530 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 4>what you would call a couple of hits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>acid.</v>

2926
02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Now I don't know what the actual dosage </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be,</v>

2927
02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:02.380
<v Speaker 4>but they would give them 100 hits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2928
02:19:02.381 --> 02:19:03.720
<v Speaker 4>they would give them totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>

2929
02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:09.020
<v Speaker 4>They would cook their fucking brain with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff and this guy came out of </v>

2930
02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.920
<v Speaker 4>those studies and there's a direct link.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has to be.</v>

2931
02:19:12.130 --> 02:19:17.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a direct link to several </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have undergone large doses </v>

2932
02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:20.300
<v Speaker 4>of LSD and severely diminished mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacities afterwards.</v>

2933
02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 4>So really diminished abilities to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalize reality to,</v>

2934
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 4>to view the world through same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

2935
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>same lens that they had before they took</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2936
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It really can fuck people's heads up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was one of them.</v>

2937
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:39.280
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that this guy is a proponent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of penske's ideas.</v>

2938
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2939
02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2940
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 1>the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot scenario,</v>

2941
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:48.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the summoning,</v>

2942
02:19:48.111 --> 02:19:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the demon scenario put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some potential that we could be</v>

2943
02:19:52.131 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 1>doing something horribly bad by creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerating technology.</v>

2944
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>But if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2945
02:19:57.700 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

2946
02:19:58.461 --> 02:20:00.440
<v Speaker 1>We're limiting ourselves to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

2947
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's throw away fucking weapons.</v>

2948
02:20:02.271 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's kill things with our face like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars.</v>

2949
02:20:04.371 --> 02:20:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to go super low tech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everything is technology.</v>

2950
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 1>No fucking stone ax is technology course</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't eat.</v>

2951
02:20:12.801 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It's funny enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even advocate for a lot of.</v>

2952
02:20:15.351 --> 02:20:20.351
<v Speaker 1>He says domestic affairs and he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was really good friends with for </v>

2953
02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>awhile and then they had a falling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the process has become kind of </v>

2954
02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the leader of that movement since </v>
<v Speaker 1>because key has been in prison,</v>

2955
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:33.910
<v Speaker 1>we're probably not representing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas accurately but,</v>

2956
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:37.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so zero's and essentially you know,</v>

2957
02:20:37.281 --> 02:20:37.970
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2958
02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows what he's advocating </v>
<v Speaker 1>would kill billions of people.</v>

2959
02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think know his main message is that </v>

2960
02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for example,</v>

2961
02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:50.540
<v Speaker 1>he blames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says school shootings is our,</v>

2962
02:20:50.541 --> 02:20:55.541
<v Speaker 1>a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the increase of school shootings in </v>

2963
02:20:55.541 --> 02:20:57.641
<v Speaker 1>America are a result of our discontent </v>
<v Speaker 1>with technology and these are wanting </v>

2964
02:20:57.641 --> 02:20:59.450
<v Speaker 1>some of the things we debated about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Stanford.</v>

2965
02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I disagree.</v>

2966
02:21:00.951 --> 02:21:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I think there are anomalies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2967
02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Their mental health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are exactly.</v>

2968
02:21:04.971 --> 02:21:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And mental health issues happen for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of reasons.</v>

2969
02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most,</v>

2970
02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:16.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone has people with mental </v>

2971
02:21:16.050 --> 02:21:16.050
<v Speaker 1>health have access to guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just goes wrong sometimes.</v>

2972
02:21:16.050 --> 02:21:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the media explodes it and you </v>

2973
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:20.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately I think,</v>

2974
02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people feel the same way,</v>

2975
02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:27.941
<v Speaker 1>that Sarah Sans ideas are way out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's not taking in the whole </v>

2976
02:21:28.521 --> 02:21:30.350
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I feel.</v>

2977
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:33.650
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2978
02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.050
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in charge now,</v>

2979
02:21:36.051 --> 02:21:37.970
<v Speaker 1>or at least he's written a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

2980
02:21:37.971 --> 02:21:42.971
<v Speaker 1>were a lot of people follow for </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially millions of anarchistic </v>

2981
02:21:42.971 --> 02:21:44.330
<v Speaker 1>around the world that are taking very </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious issue with.</v>

2982
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And so they have kind of are some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those same people that are now,</v>

2983
02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I think they attacked recently a google </v>
<v Speaker 1>bus,</v>

2984
02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:54.660
<v Speaker 1>a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's been some other attacks </v>

2985
02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:57.730
<v Speaker 1>including physical attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure what happened with </v>

2986
02:21:57.730 --> 02:22:01.331
<v Speaker 1>the Google bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was some physical attacks </v>

2987
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:01.331
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're basically,</v>

2988
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2989
02:22:01.810 --> 02:22:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it's combined with the occupy movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2990
02:22:03.861 --> 02:22:06.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all those sort of fringe groups are</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to say,</v>

2991
02:22:06.531 --> 02:22:08.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too much surveillance,</v>

2992
02:22:08.781 --> 02:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>there's too much government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2993
02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:12.350
<v Speaker 1>there's too much this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too much technology involved.</v>

2994
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And of course transhumanists are pitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of against it all.</v>

2995
02:22:15.051 --> 02:22:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Saying actually technology is improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lives of everyone.</v>

2996
02:22:19.281 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And you guys couldn't even send your </v>
<v Speaker 1>text or do arrange any of your movements</v>

2997
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 1>without all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without</v>

2998
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:28.740
<v Speaker 4>all this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's happened is,</v>

2999
02:22:28.741 --> 02:22:33.741
<v Speaker 4>ever since that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have been sort of under attack as the </v>

3000
02:22:33.741 --> 02:22:38.151
<v Speaker 4>guy who went against their Zan and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably going to have another public </v>

3001
02:22:38.151 --> 02:22:39.000
<v Speaker 4>debate because him and I liked each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

3002
02:22:39.001 --> 02:22:44.001
<v Speaker 4>We were fine talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet we represent totally extremes.</v>

3003
02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:47.430
<v Speaker 4>And he really does advocate going back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a,</v>

3004
02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:50.720
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a truly a hunter gatherer lifestyle.</v>

3005
02:22:50.721 --> 02:22:52.420
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't do that himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3006
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:55.830
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grow my own food.</v>

3007
02:22:55.831 --> 02:23:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I grow vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have chickens that I get eggs from and</v>

3008
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't think you can have.</v>

3009
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:06.330
<v Speaker 4>It's not for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't want to.</v>

3010
02:23:06.450 --> 02:23:08.490
<v Speaker 4>My friend Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the host of this show,</v>

3011
02:23:08.491 --> 02:23:10.230
<v Speaker 4>mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hunting show.</v>

3012
02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:12.600
<v Speaker 4>He has a really great point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3013
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:17.690
<v Speaker 4>we've allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Society has come up with all sorts of </v>

3014
02:23:17.690 --> 02:23:18.300
<v Speaker 4>methods where we don't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3015
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:22.080
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>eliminating our own waste,</v>

3016
02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:27.140
<v Speaker 4>for getting rid of our own garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to be responsible for </v>

3017
02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:29.901
<v Speaker 4>digging a hole and burying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to be responsible for our </v>

3018
02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:30.920
<v Speaker 4>own sewage system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to do that anymore.</v>

3019
02:23:30.930 --> 02:23:35.930
<v Speaker 4>Society figured out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's nothing wrong with a </v>

3020
02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:35.930
<v Speaker 4>supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His idea is that,</v>

3021
02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a disconnect when you just pick</v>

3022
02:23:38.401 --> 02:23:42.690
<v Speaker 4>up a piece of meat that's neatly wrapped</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Saran wrap and the little foam,</v>

3023
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:45.160
<v Speaker 4>you know trey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

3024
02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:48.750
<v Speaker 4>that's a part of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of civilization.</v>

3025
02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 4>You can go back to hunting if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is an option,</v>

3026
02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's very difficult to do and most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not going to do it.</v>

3027
02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's the reason I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like doing it.</v>

3028
02:23:58.111 --> 02:24:00.600
<v Speaker 4>It makes me feel connected to what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>

3029
02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:05.600
<v Speaker 4>But you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with going to the </v>

3030
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:05.600
<v Speaker 4>supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3031
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:05.600
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3032
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:08.220
<v Speaker 4>this idea that we need to go back to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter gatherer lifestyle.</v>

3033
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:12.270
<v Speaker 4>This is a short sided idea because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>life fucking sucked.</v>

3034
02:24:12.570 --> 02:24:13.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people die,</v>

3035
02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:15.090
<v Speaker 4>they broke their legs and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>

3036
02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Get a cavity and they die from cavities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3037
02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:20.160
<v Speaker 4>it's just infections,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin infections,</v>

3038
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3039
02:24:21.181 --> 02:24:23.700
<v Speaker 4>you had an open wound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead septic,</v>

3040
02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no antibiotics,</v>

3041
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that's technology.</v>

3042
02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:29.470
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3043
02:24:29.650 --> 02:24:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I find that incredibly shortsighted </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3044
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.410
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3045
02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I have had the luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the ways I actually even got </v>

3046
02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.960
<v Speaker 4>involved with National Geographic </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had visited a tribe in Vanuatu</v>

3047
02:24:39.961 --> 02:24:44.961
<v Speaker 4>on my sail trip and I was the very first</v>
<v Speaker 4>a foreigner in this tribe in 1995 and </v>

3048
02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:52.660
<v Speaker 4>they had never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think only two or three people had </v>

3049
02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:52.660
<v Speaker 4>actually been off the hill or off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain.</v>

3050
02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:57.561
<v Speaker 4>There are a couple of mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains to get through in this </v>

3051
02:24:57.561 --> 02:24:58.410
<v Speaker 4>mountain range and been to the ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing even a town.</v>

3052
02:24:58.411 --> 02:25:03.411
<v Speaker 4>So most that people had never seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone outside of people in their </v>

3053
02:25:03.411 --> 02:25:07.041
<v Speaker 4>village.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was the very first one to </v>

3054
02:25:07.041 --> 02:25:08.871
<v Speaker 4>actually get access into this and I went</v>
<v Speaker 4>back later for National Geographic and </v>

3055
02:25:08.871 --> 02:25:12.681
<v Speaker 4>filmed them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I have actually seen firsthand a </v>

3056
02:25:12.681 --> 02:25:16.821
<v Speaker 4>truly indigenous and authentic tribe and</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost about 40 percent of the kids do </v>

3057
02:25:21.391 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 4>not live until they're like twelfth or </v>
<v Speaker 4>13th</v>

3058
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>year because they die from various </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3059
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.920
<v Speaker 1>That's no way to run a society when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing almost half of your population,</v>

3060
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 1>people you love because of stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3061
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Snakebites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria,</v>

3062
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

3063
02:25:38.231 --> 02:25:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3064
02:25:38.681 --> 02:25:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean stuff that we can deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3065
02:25:40.691 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that's why primitive societies are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>into fertility.</v>

3066
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:47.761
<v Speaker 1>Rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were so incredible infant </v>

3067
02:25:47.761 --> 02:25:47.761
<v Speaker 1>mortality rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just ridiculous,</v>

3068
02:25:47.761 --> 02:25:47.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3069
02:25:47.761 --> 02:25:50.260
<v Speaker 1>so much death and it's not a place to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

3070
02:25:50.261 --> 02:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3071
02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:51.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3072
02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I've never been in that </v>

3073
02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:56.740
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there a couple times,</v>

3074
02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>never been in that village when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in a state of mourning.</v>

3075
02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's always in a state of mourning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mourning their,</v>

3076
02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:01.470
<v Speaker 1>their rights late last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

3077
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:06.550
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to be in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mourning because someone is always </v>

3078
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a society like that,</v>

3079
02:26:07.001 --> 02:26:12.001
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly difficult to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with technological innovation because </v>

3080
02:26:12.001 --> 02:26:12.001
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly worried about staying </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

3081
02:26:12.001 --> 02:26:14.170
<v Speaker 1>feeding your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting off the enemy,</v>

3082
02:26:14.171 --> 02:26:16.960
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an animal nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

3083
02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3084
02:26:17.591 --> 02:26:18.820
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

3085
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:22.030
<v Speaker 1>in our debate we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this,</v>

3087
02:26:22.031 --> 02:26:22.270
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3088
02:26:22.271 --> 02:26:24.970
<v Speaker 1>this is what is so great about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3089
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:26.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3090
02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>our society is that we have time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure time to dedicate to the things </v>

3091
02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:32.260
<v Speaker 1>that matter to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3092
02:26:32.430 --> 02:26:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a cavity,</v>

3093
02:26:33.491 --> 02:26:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you can replace it with a fake tooth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3094
02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I can eat steak again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3095
02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:40.150
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've asked all your teeth,</v>

3096
02:26:40.151 --> 02:26:42.220
<v Speaker 1>now you're stuck eating shrubs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

3097
02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than chewing gum.</v>

3098
02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying though.</v>

3099
02:26:50.321 --> 02:26:55.321
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I think people they fuck up </v>

3100
02:26:55.321 --> 02:26:56.960
<v Speaker 1>with this either or thing they fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this black away too far.</v>

3101
02:26:57.010 --> 02:27:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not a black and white issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it is complex and we all have </v>

3102
02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 1>unlimited amount of technology that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>must use to exist in this world today.</v>

3103
02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a cold environment that </v>

3104
02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:11.500
<v Speaker 1>is technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a vehicle,</v>

3105
02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 1>a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things.</v>

3106
02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:18.120
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are human creations and human </v>

3107
02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:20.851
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fucking house itself is a human </v>

3108
02:27:20.851 --> 02:27:21.190
<v Speaker 1>creation and if you want to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

3109
02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:23.070
<v Speaker 1>then you want technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

3110
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:25.810
<v Speaker 1>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not like installation?</v>

3111
02:27:25.811 --> 02:27:28.150
<v Speaker 1>We'll guess what installation was </v>
<v Speaker 1>created by humans.</v>

3112
02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:30.940
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to use a lighter gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that as fuck face.</v>

3113
02:27:31.090 --> 02:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3114
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:35.110
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start all your fire with </v>
<v Speaker 1>flint.</v>

3115
02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

3116
02:27:36.641 --> 02:27:37.840
<v Speaker 1>you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3117
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:38.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3118
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

3119
02:27:41.770 --> 02:27:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And they are taking the either or </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying,</v>

3120
02:27:44.141 --> 02:27:45.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the middle ground?</v>

3121
02:27:45.191 --> 02:27:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3122
02:27:46.450 --> 02:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's important also that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanists take a step back and try </v>

3123
02:27:51.450 --> 02:27:53.920
<v Speaker 1>to work with other groups and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3124
02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:56.620
<v Speaker 1>there are times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I agreed with a few of his points.</v>

3125
02:27:56.621 --> 02:28:01.621
<v Speaker 1>There are times that technology does </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienate us or make us forget some of </v>

3126
02:28:01.621 --> 02:28:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the better parts that we've just talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3127
02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3128
02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:06.070
<v Speaker 1>what do we really want to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that's totally robotic?</v>

3129
02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>

3130
02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>we do need to keep some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculousness as we discussed in our </v>

3131
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>lives or some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3132
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.290
<v Speaker 1>the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3133
02:28:14.291 --> 02:28:15.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3134
02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:20.120
<v Speaker 1>an advocation should going and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate going back words to such an </v>

3135
02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was such a farfetched</v>

3136
02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:24.650
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3137
02:28:24.651 --> 02:28:25.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3138
02:28:25.161 --> 02:28:25.730
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3139
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big movement and there's a lot of</v>

3140
02:28:28.191 --> 02:28:30.620
<v Speaker 4>people that have gone down that path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3141
02:28:30.621 --> 02:28:35.621
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the individual that's involved in </v>

3142
02:28:35.621 --> 02:28:35.621
<v Speaker 4>that movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want.</v>

3143
02:28:35.621 --> 02:28:39.251
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of area in Alaska if you </v>

3144
02:28:39.251 --> 02:28:42.221
<v Speaker 4>so choose to go and get some land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>build a house and live off the land and </v>

3145
02:28:42.221 --> 02:28:43.760
<v Speaker 4>live a subsistence living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's for you,</v>

3146
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:45.020
<v Speaker 4>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3147
02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.000
<v Speaker 4>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can live like that.</v>

3148
02:28:47.001 --> 02:28:50.510
<v Speaker 4>And there's a bunch of shows dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the people that do it.</v>

3149
02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Lena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life below zero,</v>

3150
02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:54.500
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite ones is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that.</v>

3151
02:28:54.501 --> 02:28:57.560
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to think that society has to do that</v>

3152
02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:58.460
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3153
02:28:58.461 --> 02:29:03.461
<v Speaker 4>you're digging your heels in on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>process that is impossible to slow down </v>

3154
02:29:03.730 --> 02:29:04.670
<v Speaker 4>the train left long time.</v>

3155
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:06.110
<v Speaker 4>There's no changing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3156
02:29:06.130 --> 02:29:07.790
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what we're about now.</v>

3157
02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:10.100
<v Speaker 4>It's what we've been about since they </v>
<v Speaker 4>invented metal.</v>

3158
02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:11.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3159
02:29:11.181 --> 02:29:13.910
<v Speaker 4>it's been a slow process that combustion</v>
<v Speaker 4>engine,</v>

3160
02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:15.140
<v Speaker 4>tires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roads,</v>

3161
02:29:15.350 --> 02:29:19.520
<v Speaker 4>all of it is almost an unstoppable </v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

3162
02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Three d printing is fascinating to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was one of the things I wanted </v>

3163
02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:28.541
<v Speaker 4>to bring up when it came to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were talking about the ability </v>

3164
02:29:28.541 --> 02:29:32.051
<v Speaker 4>to use cell phones to get medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by the ability to </v>

3165
02:29:32.051 --> 02:29:36.071
<v Speaker 4>actually produce things that produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in like things that are necessary</v>

3166
02:29:36.471 --> 02:29:41.360
<v Speaker 4>for survival in these villages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The the ability to instead of have goods</v>

3167
02:29:41.361 --> 02:29:46.361
<v Speaker 4>shipped in to produce them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately maybe even possibly produce </v>

3168
02:29:46.361 --> 02:29:50.831
<v Speaker 4>medicine if technology continues to </v>
<v Speaker 4>improve to produce whatever nano bots </v>

3169
02:29:51.381 --> 02:29:56.381
<v Speaker 4>that we're going to be able to inject </v>
<v Speaker 4>into our bodies to have a machine that </v>

3170
02:29:56.381 --> 02:30:00.731
<v Speaker 4>makes those things so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally fix people on the spot in any </v>

3171
02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:04.160
<v Speaker 4>remote location with these types of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologies.</v>

3172
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:06.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's something that we have to</v>

3173
02:30:06.621 --> 02:30:07.440
<v Speaker 4>look forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3174
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:12.670
<v Speaker 4>if eventually you can have something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fits in a backpack that you can </v>

3175
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:17.081
<v Speaker 4>take anywhere in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled by some type of wireless </v>

3176
02:30:17.081 --> 02:30:17.960
<v Speaker 4>signals and you could promote your like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3177
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:22.961
<v Speaker 4>I need something for this person because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they broke their leg and make it right </v>

3178
02:30:22.961 --> 02:30:23.030
<v Speaker 4>there on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3179
02:30:23.031 --> 02:30:28.031
<v Speaker 4>imagine what it would do for huge swaths</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the population that are actually </v>

3180
02:30:28.031 --> 02:30:32.830
<v Speaker 4>don't have access to that type of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could create the malaria </v>

3181
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 4>medicine right on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean it,</v>

3182
02:30:33.430 --> 02:30:35.390
<v Speaker 4>it absolutely stands to change the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

3183
02:30:35.391 --> 02:30:40.391
<v Speaker 4>And I think three d printing is probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most exciting things that </v>

3184
02:30:40.391 --> 02:30:41.920
<v Speaker 4>have happened in this decade so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3185
02:30:41.921 --> 02:30:44.690
<v Speaker 4>as far as things in the press and things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're looking forward to.</v>

3186
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:49.990
<v Speaker 4>And I think it has the possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of totally transforming manufacturing </v>

3187
02:30:50.151 --> 02:30:52.790
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might come a time when everyone in</v>

3188
02:30:52.791 --> 02:30:55.640
<v Speaker 4>their house has one and anything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you need,</v>

3189
02:30:55.641 --> 02:30:58.430
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a lava lamp or a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3190
02:30:58.431 --> 02:31:00.020
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a table or A.</v>

3191
02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'll be able to create parts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it or create it and put it together and </v>

3192
02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:05.930
<v Speaker 4>everything will come with plans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3193
02:31:05.931 --> 02:31:08.500
<v Speaker 4>and we can do now with printers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

3194
02:31:08.730 --> 02:31:13.730
<v Speaker 4>with photograph printers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can print these beautiful high </v>

3195
02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:14.390
<v Speaker 4>resolution photographs from a cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

3196
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:19.630
<v Speaker 4>He take your cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many megapixels these </v>

3197
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 4>things have now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this new iphone,</v>

3198
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:23.400
<v Speaker 4>the Lens in the camera on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

3199
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:28.550
<v Speaker 4>So you take these incredibly rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures and then you print them and </v>

3200
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:32.780
<v Speaker 4>there's large foot and put it on a frame</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you would never know if you looked </v>

3201
02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:36.531
<v Speaker 4>at that frame photo that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that came off of a regular computer </v>

3202
02:31:36.531 --> 02:31:36.531
<v Speaker 4>printer from a cell phone.</v>

3203
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing and this is something that </v>

3204
02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:41.540
<v Speaker 4>didn't exist 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>

3205
02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:45.741
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the technology wasn't </v>

3206
02:31:45.741 --> 02:31:45.741
<v Speaker 4>available 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten years ago.</v>

3207
02:31:45.741 --> 02:31:46.830
<v Speaker 4>They looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

3208
02:31:46.831 --> 02:31:48.930
<v Speaker 4>They look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

3209
02:31:48.931 --> 02:31:53.931
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the future you're going to probably </v>

3210
02:31:53.931 --> 02:31:56.090
<v Speaker 4>print them in your frame and put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there on your desk and you're </v>

3211
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.090
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3212
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:57.180
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a hologram.</v>

3213
02:31:57.310 --> 02:31:58.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

3214
02:31:58.300 --> 02:31:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3215
02:31:59.010 --> 02:32:01.950
<v Speaker 4>it's going to already be that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is a crazy.</v>

3216
02:32:02.310 --> 02:32:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen this new technology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're using?</v>

3217
02:32:04.321 --> 02:32:09.321
<v Speaker 4>What was that shit called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The with the little elephant and the </v>

3218
02:32:09.321 --> 02:32:11.190
<v Speaker 4>guy's hand that was with um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3219
02:32:11.430 --> 02:32:16.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one we did with Lewis from unbox </v>

3220
02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:16.430
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll find it,</v>

3221
02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:21.220
<v Speaker 4>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you even know about </v>

3222
02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:21.220
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some incredible.</v>

3223
02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:24.771
<v Speaker 4>Is that Google that's working on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some insane new technology that allows </v>

3224
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:29.970
<v Speaker 4>them to project three d images that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving with shadows on your hand.</v>

3225
02:32:30.210 --> 02:32:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would have star wars.</v>

3226
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:34.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen this.</v>

3227
02:32:34.231 --> 02:32:35.130
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

3228
02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:39.060
<v Speaker 4>How dare you magically magically put </v>
<v Speaker 4>this up,</v>

3229
02:32:39.061 --> 02:32:40.830
<v Speaker 4>put this up so he can get a look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

3230
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:44.010
<v Speaker 4>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a website that shows some of the</v>

3231
02:32:44.011 --> 02:32:49.011
<v Speaker 4>demos of what's going to be capable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to be possible with this </v>

3232
02:32:49.011 --> 02:32:49.530
<v Speaker 4>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's unbelievable.</v>

3233
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:54.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one that really gets me because </v>

3234
02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I have daughters and there's a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>ballerina dancing on this girl's bed.</v>

3235
02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:58.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

3236
02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's brilliant.</v>

3237
02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3238
02:33:01.591 --> 02:33:06.591
<v Speaker 4>this guy has this for folks listening to</v>
<v Speaker 4>this magic leap l e a p is the name of </v>

3239
02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:07.980
<v Speaker 4>this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can google it.</v>

3240
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:13.220
<v Speaker 4>This guy has his hands open and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a small elephant floating and dancing in</v>

3241
02:33:13.261 --> 02:33:18.261
<v Speaker 4>his hands and they're going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to project things that aren't really.</v>

3242
02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:23.100
<v Speaker 4>They're out in the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have,</v>

3243
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:25.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>floating dragons.</v>

3244
02:33:25.410 --> 02:33:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be like,</v>

3245
02:33:27.090 --> 02:33:32.090
<v Speaker 4>there's a picture here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at of these kids looking </v>

3246
02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:35.151
<v Speaker 4>at these beautiful sea horses that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>floating above their desk in their </v>

3247
02:33:35.151 --> 02:33:35.550
<v Speaker 4>classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one gets me,</v>

3248
02:33:35.730 --> 02:33:39.060
<v Speaker 4>this little girl watching a ballerina </v>
<v Speaker 4>dance on her bed.</v>

3249
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the projection </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism is,</v>

3250
02:33:42.601 --> 02:33:45.260
<v Speaker 4>what the technologies involved in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you know,</v>

3251
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:47.370
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does it come from?</v>

3252
02:33:47.430 --> 02:33:49.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God,</v>

3253
02:33:49.021 --> 02:33:51.480
<v Speaker 4>it looks insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally incredible that.</v>

3254
02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:56.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine all the billboards that are all </v>

3255
02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:56.600
<v Speaker 4>going to be taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just going to project stuff,</v>

3256
02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:58.710
<v Speaker 4>but that's just cause car crashes </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

3257
02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:01.110
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a real elephant.</v>

3258
02:34:01.111 --> 02:34:06.111
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an elephant fucking magic leap </v>

3259
02:34:06.111 --> 02:34:06.111
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3260
02:34:06.111 --> 02:34:09.831
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole host of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will change the entire world of </v>

3261
02:34:09.831 --> 02:34:09.831
<v Speaker 4>advertising.</v>

3262
02:34:09.831 --> 02:34:12.000
<v Speaker 4>It's just like know the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you'll just be like,</v>

3263
02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:14.070
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it'll change the entire thing.</v>

3264
02:34:14.071 --> 02:34:15.150
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen that yet.</v>

3265
02:34:15.151 --> 02:34:16.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did that come out?</v>

3266
02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:19.180
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty recent this month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3267
02:34:19.390 --> 02:34:21.600
<v Speaker 4>How dare you not be on the cutting edge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new,</v>

3268
02:34:21.610 --> 02:34:26.610
<v Speaker 4>the transhumanism guy working too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you to get on the twitter with </v>

3269
02:34:26.610 --> 02:34:27.600
<v Speaker 4>the young kids today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3270
02:34:27.601 --> 02:34:29.380
<v Speaker 4>we didn't find out about the Lewis came </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>

3271
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:31.460
<v Speaker 4>explain it to us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's um,</v>

3272
02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:34.470
<v Speaker 4>it's mindblowing and this is obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3273
02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:39.000
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty in tune with this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you weren't aware of this and I mean</v>

3274
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 4>how many other technologies are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>verge of announcing that these guys have</v>

3275
02:34:42.761 --> 02:34:47.761
<v Speaker 4>been working on for years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these folks are about to put out and </v>

3276
02:34:47.761 --> 02:34:48.220
<v Speaker 4>just we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not aware of yet.</v>

3277
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.900
<v Speaker 4>When that came out I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3278
02:34:49.901 --> 02:34:52.000
<v Speaker 4>this is one of those leaps that I never </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw coming.</v>

3279
02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:54.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at that guy's hands.</v>

3280
02:34:54.130 --> 02:34:59.130
<v Speaker 4>If that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's a working model that's not a </v>

3281
02:34:59.130 --> 02:34:59.590
<v Speaker 4>CGI representation of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually going to be able to do.</v>

3282
02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:02.170
<v Speaker 4>That's mindblowing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

3283
02:35:02.171 --> 02:35:07.171
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope it's not like the hover board </v>

3284
02:35:07.171 --> 02:35:09.631
<v Speaker 4>thing where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did you see the hoverboard </v>

3285
02:35:09.631 --> 02:35:09.631
<v Speaker 4>commercial that came in and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

3286
02:35:09.631 --> 02:35:11.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it ended up not being real,</v>

3287
02:35:11.411 --> 02:35:16.411
<v Speaker 4>but then I think in the last few months </v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually did do one that was sorta </v>

3288
02:35:16.411 --> 02:35:16.411
<v Speaker 4>real or sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3289
02:35:16.411 --> 02:35:20.500
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a surfer and a skateboarder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I look forward to that kind of thing.</v>

3290
02:35:20.501 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 4>It just sounds like it's something I </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreamt of,</v>

3291
02:35:22.181 --> 02:35:24.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a young kid.</v>

3292
02:35:24.370 --> 02:35:29.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>combination of like that hoverboard </v>

3293
02:35:29.370 --> 02:35:30.580
<v Speaker 4>technology along with those scooters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are those things called?</v>

3294
02:35:30.581 --> 02:35:31.790
<v Speaker 4>Those gyroscope scooters.</v>

3295
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm talking about what are those </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys segues.</v>

3296
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those segways.</v>

3297
02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever written a segway know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing,</v>

3298
02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:38.870
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

3299
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good buddy of mine and he was doing </v>

3300
02:35:44.490 --> 02:35:45.010
<v Speaker 4>that move the Paul Blart mall cop and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3301
02:35:45.011 --> 02:35:48.860
<v Speaker 4>in that movie he's riding around in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>silly segue and uh,</v>

3302
02:35:48.970 --> 02:35:50.770
<v Speaker 4>he got one because of he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3303
02:35:50.771 --> 02:35:52.120
<v Speaker 4>they are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3304
02:35:52.121 --> 02:35:53.430
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're riding a scooter.</v>

3305
02:35:53.431 --> 02:35:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Is that really fun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I rode one.</v>

3306
02:35:55.661 --> 02:35:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is incredible.</v>

3307
02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:01.090
<v Speaker 4>You lean forward to make it go and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>lean back to make it stop.</v>

3308
02:36:01.091 --> 02:36:04.190
<v Speaker 4>You turned like you shift your weight to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn with it.</v>

3309
02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:06.450
<v Speaker 4>If they're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really amazing.</v>

3310
02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:11.580
<v Speaker 4>I know that they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can just rent them for a </v>

3311
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:11.580
<v Speaker 4>vacation vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really fun,</v>

3312
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:11.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really.</v>

3313
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:12.790
<v Speaker 4>The problem is when they run out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>batteries,</v>

3314
02:36:12.791 --> 02:36:15.760
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked because George Bush was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

3315
02:36:15.761 --> 02:36:20.761
<v Speaker 4>it went out of batteries and went flying</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the top of it because it's just </v>

3316
02:36:20.761 --> 02:36:21.730
<v Speaker 4>stops and it just falls down.</v>

3317
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:27.030
<v Speaker 4>So like when the battery's out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you fucking tilt forward and fall </v>

3318
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:30.781
<v Speaker 4>flat on your face because the gyroscope </v>
<v Speaker 4>is somehow or another balancing your </v>

3319
02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:32.650
<v Speaker 4>weighed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as you're moving with this thing,</v>

3320
02:36:32.890 --> 02:36:37.890
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of correcting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like going back and forth with you and </v>

3321
02:36:37.890 --> 02:36:40.210
<v Speaker 4>when it runs out of batteries long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long do they go?</v>

3322
02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Just good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3323
02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:44.740
<v Speaker 4>how long can those teslas go when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3324
02:36:44.741 --> 02:36:46.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even those things.</v>

3325
02:36:46.301 --> 02:36:48.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean those are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're only good for like 300 miles</v>

3326
02:36:49.090 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 4>on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3327
02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3328
02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:53.510
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3329
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:56.790
<v Speaker 4>the electric car thing is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're going to,</v>

3330
02:36:56.950 --> 02:37:01.950
<v Speaker 4>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They accelerate far quicker than the </v>

3331
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:05.350
<v Speaker 4>horsepower engine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Quicker but comparable.</v>

3332
02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Like we were talking about horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 4>wars,</v>

3333
02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:11.470
<v Speaker 4>like these new teslas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Tesla Model D,</v>

3334
02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's comparable to like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really high end,</v>

3335
02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 4>like a</v>

3336
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.100
<v Speaker 1>sports car right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think they're doing zero to 60 in</v>

3337
02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:24.130
<v Speaker 1>under four seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They that ability with an electric car </v>

3338
02:37:24.130 --> 02:37:27.941
<v Speaker 1>and especially because I think they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>four wheel drives is not as much </v>

3339
02:37:27.941 --> 02:37:29.690
<v Speaker 1>traction issues as they have with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>two wheel drive cars.</v>

3340
02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:32.110
<v Speaker 1>They're getting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3341
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have gears the way like you </v>

3342
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>have to go first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gear second gear third,</v>

3343
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:41.381
<v Speaker 1>they just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know because it doesn't have a </v>

3344
02:37:41.381 --> 02:37:43.541
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to sort of regulate the </v>

3345
02:37:43.541 --> 02:37:45.881
<v Speaker 1>power through a transmission the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way as a completely different kind of </v>

3346
02:37:45.881 --> 02:37:46.260
<v Speaker 1>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all,</v>

3347
02:37:46.270 --> 02:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all pretty amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to race motorcycles growing up </v>

3348
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:54.450
<v Speaker 1>and I've been following a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the electric motorcycle market too,</v>

3349
02:37:54.451 --> 02:37:56.570
<v Speaker 1>which just slowly developing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know about that,</v>

3350
02:37:56.630 --> 02:38:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's not nearly as complex and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if anyone's making any money </v>

3351
02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:05.411
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're of course trying to do the </v>

3352
02:38:05.411 --> 02:38:07.631
<v Speaker 1>same types of things and they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the same types of things with all </v>

3353
02:38:07.631 --> 02:38:10.901
<v Speaker 1>sorts of vehicles now including </v>
<v Speaker 1>watercraft vehicles and boats and stuff </v>

3354
02:38:10.901 --> 02:38:10.901
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3355
02:38:10.901 --> 02:38:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And so the entire market it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally change.</v>

3356
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the technologies I love most is </v>

3357
02:38:19.330 --> 02:38:21.641
<v Speaker 1>the exoskeleton technology because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a feeling that within five years </v>

3358
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:25.310
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Panasonic is releasing its first</v>

3359
02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:28.760
<v Speaker 1>exoskeleton commercially in the next few</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

3360
02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:31.580
<v Speaker 1>at least according to some articles I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

3361
02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3362
02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>it's post costs around $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many are going to be </v>

3363
02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:42.041
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's even on schedule </v>

3364
02:38:42.041 --> 02:38:44.021
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a few months ago and </v>

3365
02:38:44.021 --> 02:38:46.840
<v Speaker 1>apparently going to be able to walk a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit on and lift some very heavy </v>

3366
02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:49.871
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm assuming within five years </v>

3367
02:38:49.871 --> 02:38:50.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to run and play sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>and think of some of the activity.</v>

3368
02:38:50.930 --> 02:38:55.930
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change the way a lot of </v>

3369
02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:58.420
<v Speaker 1>old unfit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obese people handle their existence </v>

3370
02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:00.110
<v Speaker 1>because either a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3371
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3372
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:03.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them can't go outside right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

3373
02:39:03.721 --> 02:39:08.721
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of them can't get to the goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bathroom to the frigerator </v>

3374
02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:08.721
<v Speaker 1>comfortably.</v>

3375
02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're wearing one of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a lot easier for a lot </v>

3376
02:39:12.850 --> 02:39:16.331
<v Speaker 1>of unfit people to move so that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionize American specialist since </v>

3377
02:39:16.331 --> 02:39:17.510
<v Speaker 1>we have so much obesity and diabetes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3378
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty sure in five years you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see a lot more sporting events.</v>

3379
02:39:21.350 --> 02:39:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things like people running with it </v>

3380
02:39:26.350 --> 02:39:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3381
02:39:26.350 --> 02:39:29.801
<v Speaker 1>you just look outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will be jogging and their </v>

3382
02:39:29.801 --> 02:39:31.631
<v Speaker 1>exoskeleton suits and they're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be very soon able to jog as </v>

3383
02:39:31.631 --> 02:39:35.411
<v Speaker 1>quickly as maybe horses or even as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day they'll probably be able to outrun </v>

3384
02:39:35.411 --> 02:39:36.620
<v Speaker 1>cheetahs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really just a matter of,</v>

3385
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:38.210
<v Speaker 1>of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3386
02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:39.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

3387
02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.380
<v Speaker 1>55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 miles an hour or something,</v>

3388
02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:45.050
<v Speaker 1>something crazy that might be 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3389
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:50.230
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great thing about the exoskeleton </v>

3390
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:52.610
<v Speaker 1>technology is that it offers the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people to use it.</v>

3391
02:39:52.610 --> 02:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some technologies like only 10 percent </v>

3392
02:39:57.610 --> 02:39:59.570
<v Speaker 1>of the population would actually use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exoskeleton technology is uh,</v>

3393
02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:01.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get a huge amount,</v>

3394
02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.770
<v Speaker 1>will become probably a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3395
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a multibillion dollar industry very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

3396
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It already is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I wore one of the cruder,</v>

3397
02:40:07.101 --> 02:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>one's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say cruder,</v>

3398
02:40:09.201 --> 02:40:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's fairly prototypical model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3399
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:17.520
<v Speaker 1>there was a show that I did for Scifi </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Joe Rogan questions everything.</v>

3400
02:40:17.521 --> 02:40:22.521
<v Speaker 1>And one of them we went to this place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I put the suit on and it kind of </v>

3401
02:40:22.521 --> 02:40:26.700
<v Speaker 1>walks with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like Kinda like makes your legs walk.</v>

3402
02:40:26.701 --> 02:40:31.701
<v Speaker 1>And for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a guy who was paralyzed from the </v>

3403
02:40:31.701 --> 02:40:32.160
<v Speaker 1>waist down and he used this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could walk around with it,</v>

3404
02:40:32.430 --> 02:40:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's attached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a tether to this power pack and it's</v>

3405
02:40:36.391 --> 02:40:39.640
<v Speaker 1>very large and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're totally bald still.</v>

3406
02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's going to be smaller and smaller</v>

3407
02:40:42.481 --> 02:40:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and the power supply is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller.</v>

3408
02:40:44.791 --> 02:40:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And as battery technology continues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve,</v>

3409
02:40:47.641 --> 02:40:52.641
<v Speaker 1>that's when things are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger and stranger and Harvard right </v>

3410
02:40:52.641 --> 02:40:55.941
<v Speaker 1>now is working on a soft one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a soft excos exoskeleton suit and </v>

3411
02:40:55.941 --> 02:41:00.921
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons we're working on is </v>

3412
02:41:00.921 --> 02:41:02.601
<v Speaker 1>for military people that are carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>these really heavy backpacks and it's </v>

3413
02:41:02.601 --> 02:41:04.980
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to be something sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the steel one where it helps you to</v>

3414
02:41:04.981 --> 02:41:05.490
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3415
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:08.520
<v Speaker 1>it helps you to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not supposed to be like you can</v>

3416
02:41:08.521 --> 02:41:13.521
<v Speaker 1>lift stuff with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just supposed to help you go much </v>

3417
02:41:13.521 --> 02:41:15.690
<v Speaker 1>further distances without getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like adding 20,</v>

3418
02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:19.500
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of your walking capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you know,</v>

3419
02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen already the test on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and uh,</v>

3420
02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:22.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty brilliant.</v>

3421
02:41:23.130 --> 02:41:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about this armor that </v>

3422
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Harvard that hardens on impact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Harvard exoskeleton.</v>

3423
02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do,</v>

3424
02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>what do we see in here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walking in it.</v>

3425
02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the soft.</v>

3426
02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I think that will really</v>

3427
02:41:36.931 --> 02:41:41.931
<v Speaker 1>catch on because people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit afraid of the metal thing </v>

3428
02:41:41.931 --> 02:41:42.270
<v Speaker 1>to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is one that I think,</v>

3429
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>

3430
02:41:44.131 --> 02:41:45.120
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a drug.</v>

3431
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:46.800
<v Speaker 1>It's an outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That jogging outfit.</v>

3432
02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3433
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And some of the tests that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this stuff is.</v>

3434
02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So this makes you stronger and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you faster and you got a little </v>

3435
02:41:55.861 --> 02:41:58.260
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack back there with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries on it.</v>

3436
02:41:58.790 --> 02:42:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the battery packs are gonna get </v>

3437
02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:05.481
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so interesting is these </v>

3438
02:42:05.481 --> 02:42:08.091
<v Speaker 1>people are working on this technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people that are working on battery </v>

3439
02:42:08.091 --> 02:42:12.051
<v Speaker 1>technology will develop smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller batteries and it'll get to a </v>

3440
02:42:12.051 --> 02:42:16.521
<v Speaker 1>point where they all work together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just create these things that we just </v>

3441
02:42:16.521 --> 02:42:16.770
<v Speaker 1>can't even wrap our hands around right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3442
02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean I look for it because I've </v>

3443
02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:24.681
<v Speaker 1>been a motorcycle rider most of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the exoskeleton business is very</v>

3444
02:42:25.261 --> 02:42:30.261
<v Speaker 1>similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of like what more cycle writing </v>

3445
02:42:30.261 --> 02:42:30.261
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's recreational.</v>

3446
02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you could put on an exoskeleton </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit and go play different types of </v>

3447
02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:36.660
<v Speaker 1>sports or go climbing or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that,</v>

3448
02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you might find yourself able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you never would have done </v>

3449
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3450
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have strength more strength and more</v>

3451
02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.240
<v Speaker 1>endurance and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think an entire recreational,</v>

3452
02:42:48.330 --> 02:42:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3453
02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise is going to occur because of </v>

3454
02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:57.681
<v Speaker 1>it where people start using exoskeleton </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology in the same way that they </v>

3455
02:42:57.681 --> 02:43:01.341
<v Speaker 1>would use recreational motorcycles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational boats where we now go do </v>

3456
02:43:01.341 --> 02:43:05.080
<v Speaker 1>exoskeleton things together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We climbed mountains,</v>

3457
02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:10.480
<v Speaker 1>climbed cliffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never would've been able to climb </v>

3458
02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:10.480
<v Speaker 1>just because we can lift ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>

3459
02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And we have grip that we never would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had.</v>

3460
02:43:11.711 --> 02:43:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's play catch with a boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3461
02:43:13.511 --> 02:43:14.250
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3462
02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:15.940
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

3463
02:43:15.941 --> 02:43:17.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's pretty.</v>

3464
02:43:17.410 --> 02:43:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It could change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of recreational things and</v>

3465
02:43:20.651 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3466
02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3467
02:43:24.791 --> 02:43:29.791
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so much money to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in that the technology is going to </v>

3468
02:43:29.791 --> 02:43:31.090
<v Speaker 1>grow a lot quicker than perhaps other </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>

3469
02:43:31.450 --> 02:43:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So I'm totally excited about it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3470
02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:35.590
<v Speaker 1>as I told my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ruined one of my articles.</v>

3471
02:43:35.591 --> 02:43:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I want one for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the first one coming out.</v>

3472
02:43:37.781 --> 02:43:38.950
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not.</v>

3473
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this artificial skin?</v>

3474
02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:46.280
<v Speaker 4>They've developed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bulletproof that's made out of </v>

3475
02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:46.280
<v Speaker 4>spider silk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3476
02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:50.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an artificial skin that they </v>

3477
02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:50.400
<v Speaker 4>believe they're going to be able to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>on human beings.</v>

3478
02:43:50.401 --> 02:43:51.990
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make people bulletproof.</v>

3479
02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of the artificial skin.</v>

3480
02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard of the bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

3481
02:43:56.610 --> 02:43:59.910
<v Speaker 4>Discovery Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to see if you want to google</v>

3482
02:43:59.911 --> 02:44:04.911
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the folks who are listening to your </v>

3483
02:44:04.911 --> 02:44:06.350
<v Speaker 4>bulletproof skin made from spider silk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so crazy.</v>

3484
02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Spiders are coming to the aid of burn </v>
<v Speaker 4>victims.</v>

3485
02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:15.240
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out a way to use spider silk and</v>

3486
02:44:15.241 --> 02:44:18.660
<v Speaker 4>combine it and some sort of a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create artificial skin.</v>

3487
02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:24.320
<v Speaker 4>And so this Dutch artist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>along with forensic genomicists genomics</v>

3488
02:44:26.610 --> 02:44:30.540
<v Speaker 4>genomics consortium in the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>created a Swatch,</v>

3489
02:44:31.050 --> 02:44:32.750
<v Speaker 4>a swatch right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

3490
02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:37.920
<v Speaker 4>of nearly bulletproof skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made from spider silk and human skin </v>

3491
02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:42.021
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That project takes its name from the </v>

3492
02:44:42.021 --> 02:44:44.511
<v Speaker 4>maximum weight and velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A type one bulletproof vest can </v>

3493
02:44:44.521 --> 02:44:47.640
<v Speaker 4>withstand from a 22 caliber long rifle </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullet.</v>

3494
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:50.410
<v Speaker 4>So this is the image that you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at it as.</v>

3495
02:44:50.430 --> 02:44:55.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a bullet that's headed towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>this piece of artificial skin that </v>

3496
02:44:55.430 --> 02:44:59.271
<v Speaker 4>they've created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is as this technology </v>

3497
02:44:59.271 --> 02:45:02.031
<v Speaker 4>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're eventually going to be able to </v>

3498
02:45:02.031 --> 02:45:05.091
<v Speaker 4>replace human skin with artificial skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bulletproof.</v>

3499
02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:08.100
<v Speaker 4>What's.</v>

3500
02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

3501
02:45:09.481 --> 02:45:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That's another like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3502
02:45:10.891 --> 02:45:12.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now nothing happened to me.</v>

3503
02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you car accident.</v>

3504
02:45:13.741 --> 02:45:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get scratched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3505
02:45:15.161 --> 02:45:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll be</v>

3506
02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:16.690
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3507
02:45:16.691 --> 02:45:21.691
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna come a point in time where </v>

3508
02:45:21.691 --> 02:45:24.400
<v Speaker 4>we're going to see people removing their</v>
<v Speaker 4>parts and changing,</v>

3509
02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:26.680
<v Speaker 4>exchanging them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could see the impact of this.</v>

3510
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Watch the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This again,</v>

3511
02:45:28.361 --> 02:45:33.361
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see the impact of this is so </v>

3512
02:45:33.361 --> 02:45:35.971
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is on new scientists have this </v>

3513
02:45:35.971 --> 02:45:36.370
<v Speaker 4>bullet hitting this spider silk skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And looked,</v>

3514
02:45:36.430 --> 02:45:39.490
<v Speaker 4>it just bounces it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you see the impact of the bullet,</v>

3515
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:43.210
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't break the skin,</v>

3516
02:45:43.211 --> 02:45:48.211
<v Speaker 4>which is just fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's an artificial skin that </v>

3517
02:45:49.091 --> 02:45:52.450
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be able to replace your </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin with some day.</v>

3518
02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:53.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3519
02:45:54.130 --> 02:45:56.230
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine.</v>

3520
02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally can't imagine mean it's </v>

3521
02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:01.560
<v Speaker 4>hitting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going,</v>

3522
02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:02.230
<v Speaker 4>you're still going to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the impact of the bullet.</v>

3523
02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:05.020
<v Speaker 4>When there was other stuff that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

3524
02:46:05.050 --> 02:46:10.050
<v Speaker 4>this armor that they've created for </v>
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle riders that hardens on </v>

3525
02:46:10.050 --> 02:46:10.050
<v Speaker 4>impact,</v>

3526
02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:14.270
<v Speaker 1>that you can mush it in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pliable until it receives an impact</v>

3527
02:46:14.390 --> 02:46:19.390
<v Speaker 1>and they do a demo with it where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hammer and they're playing with </v>

3528
02:46:19.390 --> 02:46:23.111
<v Speaker 1>it and towing it and pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he hits it with a hammer and </v>

3529
02:46:23.111 --> 02:46:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard as a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could have this armor on,</v>

3530
02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:26.930
<v Speaker 1>fall off your motorcycle and it protects</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3531
02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Like as if you're covered in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly hard like polymers shell or </v>

3532
02:46:32.140 --> 02:46:33.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds similar that you know,</v>

3533
02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:36.500
<v Speaker 1>they now have the bicycle helmets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflate when you fall,</v>

3534
02:46:36.501 --> 02:46:40.190
<v Speaker 1>it knows that through a balance and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can like if you're going to fall and</v>

3535
02:46:40.191 --> 02:46:43.970
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be an impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it inflates like very instantaneous,</v>

3536
02:46:43.971 --> 02:46:48.971
<v Speaker 1>sort of like an airbag so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wear it around your collar and it's </v>

3537
02:46:48.971 --> 02:46:49.270
<v Speaker 1>just like something right here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

3538
02:46:49.810 --> 02:46:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it protects your neck and I felt like</v>

3539
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:57.730
<v Speaker 1>one of my articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it because I thought with </v>

3540
02:46:57.730 --> 02:46:58.820
<v Speaker 1>aerial skiing where they're doing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five jumps,</v>

3541
02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.220
<v Speaker 1>if you know you're going to blow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just,</v>

3542
02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the last moment a full body </v>

3543
02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:09.221
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this kind of technology that kind </v>

3544
02:47:09.221 --> 02:47:09.740
<v Speaker 1>of like blow up stuff could protect us </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of things.</v>

3545
02:47:09.741 --> 02:47:14.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future I suppose we could wear </v>

3546
02:47:14.741 --> 02:47:14.741
<v Speaker 1>suits that protect us from our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiocy.</v>

3547
02:47:14.741 --> 02:47:14.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3548
02:47:14.741 --> 02:47:19.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean what if the entire know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it would work for </v>

3549
02:47:19.661 --> 02:47:22.121
<v Speaker 1>something like airplanes or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually we want to get to that </v>

3550
02:47:22.121 --> 02:47:22.400
<v Speaker 1>point when we are invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

3551
02:47:22.401 --> 02:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>nothing we can do can harm us and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be great.</v>

3552
02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I said that's the stuff </v>

3553
02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:32.020
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're showing on the screen.</v>

3554
02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:32.020
<v Speaker 1>This is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3555
02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:34.040
<v Speaker 1>this is this impact stuffs a cc the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skies,</v>

3556
02:47:34.041 --> 02:47:39.041
<v Speaker 1>moving it around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now watch when he hits it with his </v>

3557
02:47:39.041 --> 02:47:39.860
<v Speaker 1>hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

3558
02:47:40.370 --> 02:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>

3559
02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:42.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just showing how pliable it is.</v>

3560
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the same stuff.</v>

3561
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the same one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that I saw when he hits it,</v>

3562
02:47:48.921 --> 02:47:50.420
<v Speaker 1>it's hard as a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3563
02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:53.060
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it might be just a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of impact.</v>

3564
02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Resistant like it gave in a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that I saw,</v>

3565
02:47:57.261 --> 02:47:59.210
<v Speaker 1>he hit it with a hammer and just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dunk,</v>

3566
02:47:59.380 --> 02:48:02.150
<v Speaker 1>like he was playing with it is pliable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you hit it with a hammer,</v>

3567
02:48:02.151 --> 02:48:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

3568
02:48:04.210 --> 02:48:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I just a million things coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3569
02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:08.290
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3570
02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's great because it's just going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make us all safer without and make </v>

3571
02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:13.420
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3572
02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:13.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be able to do crazier </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3573
02:48:13.701 --> 02:48:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved seeing about.</v>

3574
02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:17.840
<v Speaker 1>You've seen this in sports in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

3575
02:48:17.841 --> 02:48:21.320
<v Speaker 1>20 years there doing stuff when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids like bicycle riding,</v>

3576
02:48:21.970 --> 02:48:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they're doing double,</v>

3577
02:48:23.751 --> 02:48:25.370
<v Speaker 1>triple stuff flips and stuff.</v>

3578
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Even in surfing the stuff they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves they're writing now,</v>

3579
02:48:30.621 --> 02:48:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you would've thought would've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed everyone,</v>

3580
02:48:32.271 --> 02:48:37.271
<v Speaker 1>but they do it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the great things about a </v>

3581
02:48:37.271 --> 02:48:40.391
<v Speaker 1>lot of the technologies just allows us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do new things we never thought </v>

3582
02:48:40.391 --> 02:48:41.120
<v Speaker 1>possible and push ourselves to new </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits.</v>

3583
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think the future is probably a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the past has been.</v>

3584
02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:48.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's going to be a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness that we,</v>

3585
02:48:48.141 --> 02:48:49.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all see in full,</v>

3586
02:48:49.491 --> 02:48:54.491
<v Speaker 1>I think every day there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many companies working on the </v>

3587
02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:54.491
<v Speaker 1>weirdest stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3588
02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:59.381
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could probably do another </v>

3589
02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:01.421
<v Speaker 1>podcast in six months in everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about today will be </v>

3590
02:49:01.421 --> 02:49:04.361
<v Speaker 1>obsolete now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll probably be some new stuff six </v>

3591
02:49:04.361 --> 02:49:04.361
<v Speaker 1>months down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3592
02:49:04.361 --> 02:49:06.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of what exponential </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth is about,</v>

3593
02:49:06.681 --> 02:49:06.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3594
02:49:06.890 --> 02:49:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the growth happens so quickly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as time goes on,</v>

3595
02:49:10.561 --> 02:49:11.940
<v Speaker 1>it happens quicker and quicker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

3596
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

3597
02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until it's just,</v>

3598
02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:15.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say six months.</v>

3599
02:49:15.781 --> 02:49:20.781
<v Speaker 1>It could be three months at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>after and then one and a half of course </v>

3600
02:49:20.781 --> 02:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually it will be like that.</v>

3601
02:49:21.091 --> 02:49:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it'll just be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spike is straight up and you know,</v>

3602
02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>

3603
02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It seems almost impossible to think like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3604
02:49:28.831 --> 02:49:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but when you actually look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modeling it,</v>

3605
02:49:31.041 --> 02:49:36.041
<v Speaker 1>it actually is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are huge amounts of new companies </v>

3606
02:49:36.041 --> 02:49:37.140
<v Speaker 1>working on stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day they get an idea,</v>

3607
02:49:37.141 --> 02:49:40.220
<v Speaker 1>they think something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get funding and they just,</v>

3608
02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy world we live in,</v>

3609
02:49:42.661 --> 02:49:45.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy getting crazier.</v>

3610
02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Totally and changing rapidly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more brilliant I think as as </v>

3611
02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the days go by.</v>

3612
02:49:52.170 --> 02:49:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
