43
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a fucking weird contract.</v>

44
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Did you eat before you went to bed before you had this dream?</v>

51
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe more.</v>

52
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 3>We know that certain</v>

53
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>compounds in food definitely affect like Melatonin definitely affects the way</v>

57
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say these Alpha brain pills and we've been saying they</v>

58
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>definitely affected.</v>

59
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>We've just been hearing about that.</v>

60
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Took tressel told him,</v>

61

<v Speaker 1>No I don't.</v>

66
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe it's just a placebo effect.</v>

67
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe it.</v>

68
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Just we'll see about that because of the dreams,</v>

69
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 1>the dreams that the number one reason why I'm pretty convinced it's not a</v>

70
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect is because I have these fucking weird dreams,</v>

71
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

72
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>They're like super potent dreams where a lot of times during them I'm aware that</v>

73
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a dream,</v>

74
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but the dream is so strong.</v>

75
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>There's like no getting that on it.</v>

76
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm always like,</v>

77
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:33.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>this is a dream,</v>

79
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

80
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

81
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.991
<v Speaker 1>This is just a dream.</v>

82
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:36.824
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>

83
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you have ever have a lucid dream before?</v>

84
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I like this now.</v>

85
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I never had any,</v>

86
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 3>like I've,</v>

87
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I've had moments,</v>

88
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but I've always in the middle of the moment freaked out and realize,</v>

89
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:47.721
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

90
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I am flying.</v>

91
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm controlling my fly.</v>

92
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>This amazing.</v>

93
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>But it felt so fucking real right before I woke up,</v>

95
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>but I was only able to hold onto it.</v>

96
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Slippery for a few seconds.</v>

97
00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

98
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Now since taking these fucking pills,</v>

99
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I hold onto it for like a half an hour sometimes and you do crazy shit.</v>

100
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God</v>

101
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.801
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

102
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Is that like the guy who like when you're playing grand theft auto,</v>

103
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 3>when you get the baseball bat and just walk around and beat the shit out of</v>

104
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:14.831
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

105
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 3>you don't even play the game.</v>

106
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Mine was super bizarre and I've told the story.</v>

107
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:19.650
<v Speaker 1>So in the interest of brevity,</v>

108
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a werewolf and a gorilla were 69 in each other.</v>

109
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:24.414
<v Speaker 1>And my dream,</v>

110
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a big,</v>

111
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.130
<v Speaker 1>big fucking Brown Werewolf and a big gray gorilla and there were 69 each other</v>

112
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:37.521
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to walk really quietly because I didn't want them to wake up</v>

113
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want him to come after it.</v>

114
00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It was so vivid.</v>

115
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It was the most ridiculous fucking vivid dream I've ever had.</v>

116
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I can remember the texture on the wall.</v>

117
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I could remember what the table looked like where there was 69 and each other,</v>

118
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 3>I think worst turbo itching at the worst Joe Rogan during the other day.</v>

119
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 3>And I was in it.</v>

120
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

121
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.670
<v Speaker 3>it was all about you.</v>

122
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 3>And it was gang raped by a mummy.</v>

123
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.951
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

124
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:01.101
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

125
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:01.934
<v Speaker 3>it was worse.</v>

126
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 3>I did Alpha brain and,</v>

127
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and it was very creepy and I like almost don't even want to say it cause it was,</v>

128
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but I woke up and I told my girlfriend gay shit,</v>

129
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:10.131
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

130
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 3>I woke up and they will go time to devote to my European cues.</v>

131
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's best to keep you seeking support.</v>

132
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

133

138
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 3>over and kissed you.</v>
