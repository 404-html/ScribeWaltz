<v Speaker 1>but you all,</v>

12

<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the guys that do have like a,</v>

15
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>a hot woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a best friend that they're not</v>

16
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>banging and they pretend no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just totally platonic.</v>

17
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never trust that guy unless he</v>

18
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>has like an insanely hot wife that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or,</v>

19
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>or if they used to date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

20
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

21
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>If they legitimately have nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other anymore.</v>

22
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have exes that like I wouldn't</v>

23
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>want to sleep with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in their hot,</v>

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

25
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over,</v>

26
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're still friends friendly and</v>

27
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>did not your best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking weird.</v>

28
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's weird when anybody,</v>

29
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>like when a guy is like working in angle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying really hard to like position</v>

30
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>himself as better than he positioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as being like different than</v>

31
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>every other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys out there doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>really negative things.</v>

33
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I read this one guy's fucking twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>page other day.</v>

34
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like he's.</v>

35
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>He might be the ultimate White Knight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give out his twitter</v>

36
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>

37
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>He might be like the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I met him,</v>

38
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>he probably has almost no blood in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>veins is blood sugar is probably zero.</v>

39
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>He probably faints all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so weak.</v>

40
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things he said is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

41
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I still practice feminists,</v>

42
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>still practice feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I no longer associate.</v>

43
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I no longer would you say advertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself as a feminist because I feel like</v>

44
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's up to women to decide whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not I'm doing feminism correctly.</v>

45
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll still practice feminism,</v>

46
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but I will no longer advertise myself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feminist.</v>

47
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

48
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't even know what to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started playing in a rock band and my</v>

50
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 2>20th century I didn't do much martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts at all.</v>

51
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>After you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you practice music before that?</v>

52
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Like when did you get involved in music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a growing up as a kid,</v>

53
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lee and Alice Cooper are like my</v>
<v Speaker 2>two Glam rock came from the makeup and,</v>

54
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 2>and a late mid twenties I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing in a band and I really liked</v>

55
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 2>performing and I did a lot of jumping</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kicking and wearing tight pants and</v>

56
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and David Lee Roth.</v>

57
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

58
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

59
00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>but you and David Lee Roth in the New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York dolls know very drunk,</v>

60
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fucked up like through the whole</v>

61
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:11.000
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we would go and we.</v>

62
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told Eddie this story.</v>

63
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't told a lot of people this</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

64
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 2>but people ask me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends ask me about it recently,</v>

65
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>but I was basically on tour.</v>

66
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>So I do that for like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

67
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 2>14 years and we're touring England in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>

68
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

69
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy and a few places like that we did</v>

70
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>really well over there and I had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure from just doing so much drugs</v>

71
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.721
<v Speaker 2>and drinking so much and like a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you basically I had been,</v>

72
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>when I came back the doctor said the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vodka and red bull was actually the</v>

73
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>biggest component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I took a lot of speed over</v>

74
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>the three days without sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me drink more vodka,</v>

75
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 2>red bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically as the sugar leaves your</v>

76
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes down and you and you get sick</v>

77
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>and when the alcohol then leaves your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

78
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>it draws more sugar and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypoglycemic seizure.</v>

79
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So I've lived laying on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt terrible for like 10 hours and</v>

80
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden apparently I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelled something and people came over</v>

81
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and I felt this electricity shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>down my arms into my hands and they just</v>

82
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 2>locked up and I rolled back down.</v>

83
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>My eyes rolled in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was 10 seconds later and</v>

84
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>everyone's looking at me like I just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out,</v>

85
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then apparently it was like a minute</v>

86
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 2>or something and I went back and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor said,</v>

87
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get your life together.</v>

88
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 2>And I started training martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 2>again pretty much that day.</v>

89
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 2>And then I trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then five,</v>

91
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>then seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I was doing Jujitsu Monday,</v>

92
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday 7:00 AM noon and 6:00 PM and</v>

93
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday and Thursday noon and 6:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wait a minute,</v>

94
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you were training Jujitsu three times a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

95
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>

96
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.011
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>

97
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday,</v>

98
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Thursday for about six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people kind of knew me a little</v>

99
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on television doing stuff.</v>

100
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I was like a reality show judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the network said,</v>

101
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fight.</v>

102
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Well why don't we do a TV show about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

103
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of allowed me.</v>

104
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I really want it to be in the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

105
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love the second I kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

106
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been not living a crazy lifestyle.</v>

107
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>All I wanted to do his martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then real really from that minute</v>

108
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I kind of did.</v>

109
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's all I was interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get started rapping you do</v>

110
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you consider that rap kind of started</v>

111
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>off in spoken word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started off,</v>

112
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 2>just kind of spirals into hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

113
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who've spoken word and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit basically in poetry,</v>

114
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but it was exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

115
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>spoken word has potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have people like being.</v>

116
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 2>People love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a dream.</v>

117

118
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>dream speech was referred to as spoken</v>
