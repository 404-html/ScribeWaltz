00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no season 10 was the best.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.343
<v Speaker 1>We're to live.</v>

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.141
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anything.</v>

5
00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:05.974
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anything,</v>

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to fight companion.</v>

8
00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>If you never heard one of these podcasts before,</v>

9
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>this is not a normal podcast,</v>

10
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it becomes a normal podcast.</v>

11
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>So take a chance,</v>

12
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:21.724
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

13
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Brendan shops in the motherfucking house and my brother Eddie Bravo,</v>

14
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>

15
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and we're watching the fights.</v>

16
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>This is fight night live from Japan.</v>

17
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:33.514
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

18
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett versus big country.</v>

19
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Roy Nelson.</v>

20
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.771
<v Speaker 1>That's the main event.</v>

21
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Uriah hall versus Musashi.</v>

22
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a fight I really want to say that's tonight too.</v>

23
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a big fucking fight.</v>

24
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a juicy one.</v>

25
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.063
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one,</v>

26
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>a huge one for you.</v>

27
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big chance for Moose saucy when he has to take a chance.</v>

28
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Musafa.</v>

29
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>He's given them a shot.</v>

30
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.131
<v Speaker 1>He's given them a shot.</v>

31
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're Ryan Hall shows up.</v>

32
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>That's Uriah Hall is best moments inside the octagon.</v>

33
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Like Uriah Hall,</v>

34
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I think when he's sharp is one of the fastest fucking one.</v>

35
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

36
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>185 pounds.</v>

37
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

38
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>He's so athletic.</v>

39
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what wouldn't take one of them the most?</v>

40
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

41
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>the biggest curiosities about that dude's when he broke his foot,</v>

42
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>fucked it up real bad.</v>

43
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you could look down in between rounds.</v>

44
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at his toe.</v>

45
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>His Toe was Jack.</v>

46
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>The bone was sticking out of it.</v>

47
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Hobbles back to his corner.</v>

48
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Then the bell starts the next round.</v>

49
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing kicks with it.</v>

50
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing kicks with it and he's moving around like he doesn't feel fucking</v>

51
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

52
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as the rounds over that mean that he's wobbling,</v>

53
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it'd be barely walk at the end of the fight.</v>

54
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>That takes some serious mental toughness for sure.</v>

55
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Which is your eyes biggest knock,</v>

56
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:39.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>His mental.</v>

58
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

59
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I trained with the guy for a year.</v>

60
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

61
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a athletically.</v>

62
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>He's the biggest freak.</v>

63
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>He's his own worst enemy.</v>

64
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

65
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.943
<v Speaker 1>if the.</v>

66
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.263
<v Speaker 1>If the.</v>

67
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>If the hall shows up with the right mind frame.</v>

68
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

69
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

70
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best in the world.</v>

71
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a big fucking f.</v>

72
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>

73
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Moussaka is five guys,</v>

74
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>just like you're at home.</v>

75
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>He's beat Osp.</v>

76
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Hector,</v>

77
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Lumbar,</v>

78
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>back in the day holding flat,</v>

79
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>big disclosive bank Osp has mad potential,</v>

80
00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:08.121
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

81
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>and I think he gets better every time he fights.</v>

82
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Like the shogun knockout was a big fucking deal.</v>

83
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I was super shocked by that.</v>

84
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>The Pack Cummins knock on.</v>

85
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

86
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

87
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 1>OSP is getting better every single time we see him,</v>

88
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>but like it would come to the execution of techniques.</v>

89
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>There's just some shit that uriah hall can do that Osp can't quite do.</v>

90
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see,</v>

91
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>but those will be shielded off against world class competition.</v>

92
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't beat any ebo right?</v>

93
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

94
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You're hunting kind of c level guys.</v>

95
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You're 100 percent.</v>

96
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

97
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.573
<v Speaker 1>And that was my,</v>

98
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 1>my kind of original point was that Uriah Hall,</v>

99
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>like his movement inside the octagon,</v>

100
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>like when he's sharp as he can be,</v>

101
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>he can do some freaky shit.</v>

102
00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

103
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>He can.</v>

104
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>You see that Ron stallings fight when you get that right hand,</v>

105
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right hand is a God damn late Matrix Shit Matrix shift,</v>

106
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of stringing together those moments when it's crucial and OSP</v>

108
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>has definitely been able to do that more than him.</v>

109
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

110
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.993
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>

111
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.123
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>

112
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but when it becomes too like those spectacular movements that Uriah Hall dues,</v>

113
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.620
<v Speaker 1>when I see Osp,</v>

114
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I see a super strong,</v>

115
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>really tough guy who obviously works real hard and is better every time you see</v>

116
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:16.121
<v Speaker 1>him fight,</v>

117
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Like those fucking power left kicks.</v>

119
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.450
<v Speaker 1>He throws a crazy athlete and he's.</v>

120
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>He's got total world championship potential.</v>

121
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>If that guy keeps accelerating at the pace he's at now you can see Osp at a</v>

122
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>world championship level in a year,</v>

123
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe even two years.</v>

124
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

125
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.023
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>

126
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but what you're Ryan Hall does,</v>

127
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>he does that every now and then.</v>

128
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>You get these bursts of that next level shit.</v>

129
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You get these bursts of that.</v>

130
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:38.801
<v Speaker 1>Ron stallings,</v>

131
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>righthand the we'll kick that.</v>

132
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>He knocked that kid out on tough and again,</v>

133
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>he's not fighting this the highest level of competition when he's pulling these</v>

134
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.061
<v Speaker 1>techniques off,</v>

135
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>but they're there for.</v>

136
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>They're there but not,</v>

137
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but he just hasn't done it.</v>

138
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

139
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>against a high level guy.</v>

140
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Then when he started pulling that shit like people that shit off tonight against</v>

141
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>them saucy,</v>

142
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>like most aussies kind of seen this man.</v>

143
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

144
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>he's made some good good.</v>

145
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>

146
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.210

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Have to talk to my wife about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't do it for,</v>

171
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.381
<v Speaker 2>for being gay.</v>

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>He would do it to get the fucking pictures.</v>

175
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.240

<v Speaker 1>The golden rule.</v>

185
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>The Internet.</v>

186

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 1>someone somewhere has photoshop with Dick in your mouth.</v>

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 3>They always involve like 100 black dicks.</v>

198
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I could have 50 arms and shit is ridiculous.</v>

199
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.961
<v Speaker 3>They're funny.</v>

200
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:05.794
<v Speaker 3>His helmet,</v>

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:08.001
<v Speaker 3>He's always done.</v>

204
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 3>It was like a funny sense of humor,</v>

205
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 3>but some people can do it and they can get so close that girls get really mad</v>

206
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 3>because like famous actresses have been like in porn scenes,</v>

207
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.530
<v Speaker 3>they just put their body in,</v>

208
00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>they more for girls.</v>

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.861
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

211
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 3>You can do anything now with that stuff.</v>

212
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 3>With photo editing,</v>

213
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>they can literally have you wrestling a dinosaur.</v>

214
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:26.991
<v Speaker 3>All their needs.</v>

215
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 3>You're faced anything from game of thrones.</v>

216
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 3>When they made her walk through the city naked,</v>

217
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 3>turns out it wasn't her body.</v>

218
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

219
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.161
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

220
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.994
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

221
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.903
<v Speaker 3>Is the body.</v>

222
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what Red Band set?</v>

223
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>

224
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

225
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.794
<v Speaker 3>he would probably know.</v>

226
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it is true.</v>

227
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it makes sense to watch that shit.</v>

228
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Was that chick I was probably be like,</v>

229
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

230
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 3>you can make a dragon.</v>

231
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't give me fake tits.</v>

232
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.913
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

233
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to see my real teeth?</v>

234
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>That's creepy.</v>

235
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to stare into my asshole.</v>

236
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 3>I walked on the street.</v>

237
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 3>She was totally naked and you got like a hundred,</v>

238
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 3>200 people that are working as extras that are the slaves and the peasants</v>

239
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

240
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 3>So they're all going to see her naked too.</v>

241
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.033
<v Speaker 3>That's not fun.</v>

242
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

243
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 3>You see her ass all and she's like,</v>

244
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 3>bear crawling through the city.</v>

245
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I've been naked in a couple of things.</v>

246
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I was naked in this,</v>

247
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

248
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 3>thing that I did for a news radio once.</v>

249
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 3>I had to be naked in front of the whole idea was like I was waiting for this</v>

250
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 3>chick in her apartment and uh,</v>

251
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

252
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.511
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to,</v>

253
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:21.344
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

254
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I forget the whole premise.</v>

255
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was trying to get her to date me or something like that.</v>

256
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:26.140
<v Speaker 3>So I lit a bunch of candles.</v>

257
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I took my clothes off.</v>

258
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Do they pay extra for that or no?</v>

259
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

260
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

261
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.323
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

262
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you have something over your junk and no knowledge of my Dick was hanging out</v>

263
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 3>and when she came in I covered it up.</v>

264
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I had to cover it up.</v>

265
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the scene of the movie.</v>

266
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:38.931
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

267
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:39.171
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

268
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 3>it's you or I forget the premise.</v>

269
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 3>It was on news radio was long time ago.</v>

270
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It was not uncomfortable for sure.</v>

271
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

272
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 3>And then there was another one that I did for the vh one fashion awards.</v>

273
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 3>It was like 1997.</v>

274
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I did this thing where I played this photographer that was crazy and he,</v>

275
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything about photography.</v>

276
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 3>I was just to try to get laid.</v>

277
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole thing.</v>

278
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

279
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I would say to the girl,</v>

280
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 3>do you have any problems with nudity?</v>

281
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.131
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

282
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

283
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.271
<v Speaker 3>and next thing you know,</v>

284
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking pictures of her while naked.</v>

285
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 3>So I had to be naked in front of her.</v>

286
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 3>That was European.</v>

287
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 3>She didn't get back in the day.</v>

288
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.171
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day,</v>

289
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

290
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I was seven.</v>

291
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I was in line behind Tony to suits.</v>

292
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:13.494
<v Speaker 3>I remember that guy.</v>

293
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a wild man for from Peru,</v>

294
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jujitsu and a neck tie.</v>

295
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 3>He didn't exactly.</v>

296
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 3>He did a 2003 Abu Dhabi.</v>

297
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 3>And when we were weighing in,</v>

298
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I killed myself to get down to 1:45 and I'm in line and he's in front of me and</v>

299
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 3>we both got our underwear on.</v>

300
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 3>And you see the Japanese press right there.</v>

301
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:31.510
<v Speaker 3>You see Brazilian press holy,</v>

302
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 3>the Gracie sitting down where I'm waiting to weigh in.</v>

303
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Tony goes first,</v>

304
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 3>he drops his under what gets naked.</v>

305
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 3>No one says shit.</v>

306
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.961
<v Speaker 3>He gets naked,</v>

307
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 3>he weighs any makes way.</v>

308
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 3>And then I come in and I was so close I got,</v>

309
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's cool to get naked.</v>

310
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I pulled down</v>

311
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 3>and the Japanese press come up quick and start taking pictures of your Dick,</v>

312
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.671
<v Speaker 3>me naked,</v>

313
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 3>standing there naked.</v>

314
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing comfortable poses and like most</v>

315
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 4>of most muscular poses,</v>

316
00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 4>one post I then I went like this,</v>

317
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.070
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

318
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 4>Then I did the opposite of the incredible hulk and I got all a submissive and</v>

319
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.041
<v Speaker 4>just covered my balls.</v>

320
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Like I was really shy and it got.</v>

321
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 4>That's the picture they use.</v>

322
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 4>They put that Shit on magazine.</v>

323
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

324
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

325
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 4>is there anything that could pay you now to do that?</v>

326
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 4>To get naked and film some shit on TV?</v>

327
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 4>I just thought he just passed.</v>

328
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big a deal.</v>

329
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

330
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 4>What's the big deal?</v>

331
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 4>You're someone sees your Dick people that were so crazy about your body.</v>

332
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 4>But if someone was like,</v>

333
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.240
<v Speaker 4>oh Joe went on TV music awards and wants you to be on stage.</v>

334
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

335
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that would be something I'd be into doing and pass the seems very</v>

336
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:38.814
<v Speaker 4>embarrassing.</v>

337
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 4>But the idea behind it is that there's something wrong with you being naked,</v>

338
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

339
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 4>and like that.</v>

340
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.280
<v Speaker 4>We don't know that we all.</v>

341
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:45.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

342
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 4>look at this crowd of people,</v>

343
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

344
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 4>You Watch these two dudes fight.</v>

345
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know who they are.</v>

346
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.230
<v Speaker 4>You Watch these two.</v>

347
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Does a good scrap actually had his humbly just got dropped.</v>

348
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Look at all those people in the audience and you'll notice they all have clothes</v>

349
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

350
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

351
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of ridiculous.</v>

352
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Clothes are kind of ridiculous.</v>

353
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 4>You just want everyone to be naked.</v>

354
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

355
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>

356
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.700
<v Speaker 4>this idea that we've created this outer wear,</v>

357
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of a fucking weird homemade hermit crab thing.</v>

358
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 4>We've created this outer shell that we must have on except in the most intimate</v>

359
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.154
<v Speaker 4>moments.</v>

360
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's something almost.</v>

361
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 4>There's almost something where the human race realized how sexual and fucking</v>

362
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 4>crazy it is and like,</v>

363
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

364
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 4>the only way we're going to get anything done is if we invent close cover shit</v>

365
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

366
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 4>We just can't have people just fucking.</v>

367
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 4>Every time they run into each other,</v>

368
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 4>first husband just cover up their checks or make that makes sense.</v>

369
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

370
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the oldest civilizations on earth,</v>

371
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.381
<v Speaker 4>it's the Middle East,</v>

372
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:40.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

373
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.820
<v Speaker 4>And aren't those the ones who cover the women up the most?</v>

374
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.303
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

375
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 4>ever have to deal with jealousy or possessiveness.</v>

376
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Mad Genius.</v>

377
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Like $50,</v>

378
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.230
<v Speaker 4>billion dollars,</v>

379
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

380
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 4>that's the least they could do.</v>

381
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're getting though.</v>

382
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:02.881
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

383
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like a cracker Jack.</v>

384
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.510
<v Speaker 4>There was like a loyalty guy that was arrested in La for sexual assault.</v>

385
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Some woman came screaming out of his place.</v>

386
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 4>She was like half naked or something like that.</v>

387
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

388
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.620
<v Speaker 4>That he was arrested and he,</v>

389
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have immunity and it's a one of a series of events that have happened</v>

390
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:26.691
<v Speaker 4>with like really rich people from the Middle East in Beverly Hills over the last</v>

391
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 4>couple of weeks.</v>

392
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 4>Because the other one that happened was there was a race.</v>

393
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I talked about it with you now with me.</v>

394
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 4>We went to,</v>

395
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 4>we went to Disneyland.</v>

396
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 4>They have this thing called Saudi summer and in the summer in Saudi Arabia,</v>

397
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 4>it's apparently it's unfucking God the hot.</v>

398
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people come over from Saudi Arabia to la and they buy these crazy</v>

399
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 4>powerhouses in beverly hills.</v>

400
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.110
<v Speaker 4>And they bring over these cars that he's multimillion dollar cars,</v>

401
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 4>like a blue gotti.</v>

402
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>They run like a one and a half million dollar and they have</v>

403
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Arab license plates on them.</v>

404
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have like,</v>

405
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a registered car in America that could.</v>

406
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.020
<v Speaker 1>They bring them over here in.</v>

407
00:12:00.021 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to drive them around.</v>

408
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And so they're driving these cars around and they're racing through the streets</v>

409
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>of Beverly Hills and they get video of it.</v>

410
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>People get video of these people in million dollar cars running red lights.</v>

411
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 1>This guy in a porsche gt,</v>

412
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:11.651
<v Speaker 1>three is chasing them,</v>

413
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 1>runs a red light or runs a stop sign.</v>

414
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy to watch.</v>

415
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's wild and out out.</v>

416
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>These people are at,</v>

417
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>there's other people at the intersection.</v>

418
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>These guys are flying through the stop sign with a Porsche Jesus in Beverly</v>

419
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Hills.</v>

420
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the cars pulling in the Ferrari smoking and all these people are</v>

421
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 1>taking videos on people.</v>

422
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole neighborhood is out and they all have their iphones.</v>

423
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>They're video taping it in the street.</v>

424
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>So that happens.</v>

425
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 1>And then right after that happened,</v>

426
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>this incident happened.</v>

427
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So apparently a lot of these people like they're asking for diplomatic immunity</v>

428
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 1>because they're rich and man,</v>

429
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that amazing?</v>

430
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:45.514
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

431
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:45.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

432
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

433
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're saying.</v>

434
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Like some,</v>

435
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>some of these people that do things like that over here,</v>

436
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't prosecute them because they have something called diplomatic immunity.</v>

437
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

438
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

439
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>That means is they have a lot of dirt on the people running the ship.</v>

457
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>There's cars to the left and to the right.</v>

458
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>That guy just blows through this neighborhood.</v>

459
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:22.991

<v Speaker 1>Can't do that here.</v>

462
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what all these people in the street and they're filming the Ferrari.</v>

463
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That's like a million dollar car.</v>

464
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

466
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a La Ferrari.</v>

467
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a million dollar car.</v>

468
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Plus it might even be more than a middle of the GT three.</v>

469
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.250
<v Speaker 1>There's the big run.</v>

470
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys have insane amounts of money and they're buying up giant</v>

471
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 1>houses in Beverly Hills and homeboy do with the girl though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I know he got arrested.</v>

477
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what the actual reality of the cases,</v>

478
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 1>but I know the dude got arrested.</v>

479
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.361
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

480
00:13:58.361 --> 00:13:58.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

481
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Narcos,</v>

482
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

483
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.153
<v Speaker 1>This shit.</v>

484
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It makes game of thrones look like Harry Potter,</v>

485
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.783
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

486
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>

487
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to get into it.</v>

488
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I just got just 10 episodes.</v>

489
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:13.234
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

490
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.423
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>

491
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 1>knocked out 10 and two days.</v>

492
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>You're done with it yet.</v>

493
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I just finished this week.</v>

494
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.663
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile I'm stuck.</v>

495
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck on a bad show right now.</v>

496
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

497
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Empire?</v>

498
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:24.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

499
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the strain is empire bad.</v>

500
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.781
<v Speaker 1>I heard it.</v>

501
00:14:26.781 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

502
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

503
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 1>The first,</v>

504
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 1>the first season was good.</v>

505
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have anything else to watch,</v>

506
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.193
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

507
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

508
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

509
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.163
<v Speaker 1>if there's no,</v>

510
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 1>it's better than watching whatever's on at two in the morning on regular TV.</v>

511
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.230
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

512
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>as season one or season two just started.</v>

513
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I just watched the season premiere yesterday.</v>

514
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Whoa dude.</v>

515
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Rogers is finally looking like Kenny Rogers again.</v>

516
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 1>They reversed some of that,</v>

517
00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:52.110
<v Speaker 1>a crazy facial surgery that they did on</v>

518
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

519
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 4>That was some sad shit dude.</v>

520
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.120
<v Speaker 4>He looked like monetarily Silva to know he got it.</v>

521
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.830
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look anything like him.</v>

522
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 4>They pulled his face way.</v>

523
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 4>Where do the girls do that too?</v>

524
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 4>They get while they go to a bad doctor.</v>

525
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

526
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 4>apparently if you go to a good doctor that knows what they're doing,</v>

527
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.770
<v Speaker 4>they can,</v>

528
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

529
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 4>they can tighten you up and it looks pretty good.</v>

530
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 4>I feel like they all look the same.</v>

531
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.990
<v Speaker 4>They all look the exact same.</v>

532
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 4>The ones that we're recognizing or the ones that are terrible.</v>

533
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why we say they all look the same.</v>

534
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some attractive older women that have had like little nips and</v>

535
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.494
<v Speaker 4>Tucks,</v>

536
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

537
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 4>but I think when we see something like Kenny Rogers,</v>

538
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:28.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

539
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 4>there's something hideous about it,</v>

540
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

541
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.200
<v Speaker 4>If someone chose to squeeze their face tight to erase some of the lines,</v>

542
00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 4>bomber man,</v>

543
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.703
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

544
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Because.</v>

545
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

546
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Because especially that guy,</v>

547
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 4>he was like this beloved character,</v>

548
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

549
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:42.211
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

550
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 4>the whole,</v>

551
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 4>the gambler series.</v>

552
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.091
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Lefthand seats.</v>

555
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think those guys like the celebrities,</v>

556
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 4>like they're so used to people seeing them for that so that they don't want to</v>

557
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 4>ever let it go.</v>

558
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.560
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

559

<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this about when it comes to girls bodies,</v>

618
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.390
<v Speaker 4>you prefer 10 pounds overweight or 10 pounds underweight?</v>

619
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Ten pounds over every time.</v>

620
00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

621
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Every time.</v>

622
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

623
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 4>hop over.</v>

624
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.380
<v Speaker 4>Little fat ain't going to hurt nobody.</v>

625
00:17:43.381 --> 00:17:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Little little belly roll.</v>

626
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Nah.</v>

627
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Gives you a little extra gas.</v>

628
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.810
<v Speaker 4>No one wants a bag of bones in the bed.</v>

629
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel everything.</v>

630
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 4>I want to be</v>

631
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.190
<v Speaker 2>skinny for other girls.</v>

632
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

633
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

634
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 2>When you think when you see those girls walking around the ring,</v>

635
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.040
<v Speaker 2>they want to be like a skinny as possible.</v>

636
00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Like in this culture.</v>

637
00:17:57.951 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 2>In our culture in Brazil,</v>

638
00:17:59.311 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

639
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.331
<v Speaker 2>They're not like that man.</v>

640
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Those girls are thick,</v>

641
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.770
<v Speaker 2>but they have flat stomach.</v>

642
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.653
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

643
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.960
<v Speaker 2>They're in very good shape because we're in very good shape.</v>

644
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

645
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>they're all in very good shape,</v>

646
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>but there's just so much worry about putting a little weight on anybody.</v>

647
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Like a girl that has like a little,</v>

648
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>like an extra 10 pounds.</v>

649
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.100
<v Speaker 2>If I'm managing the green girls,</v>

650
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking even Mickey d's.</v>

651
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.753
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

652
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that though.</v>

653
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that they think they know?</v>

654
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 2>All they do is drink fucking coffee and water and like ice cubes for dinner.</v>

655
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Especially a few days before.</v>

656
00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

657
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:30.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

659
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>

660
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Get that full rack of ribs.</v>

661
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Girls.</v>

662
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.931
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

663
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

664
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.951
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

665
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:35.201
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

666
00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird thing because every guy talked to almost universally has the</v>

667
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:40.261
<v Speaker 2>same opinion,</v>

668
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

669
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of body weight on a girl doesn't bother you at all.</v>

670
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.540
<v Speaker 2>You're not my friend if you like skinny bitches,</v>

671
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 2>fucking skinny girls.</v>

672
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>No Way with like a skinny girls.</v>

673
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.870
<v Speaker 2>There's some skinny girls are hot as fuck.</v>

674
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 2>So some girls are just sexy,</v>

675
00:18:58.411 --> 00:18:58.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

676
00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

677
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>There's girls but the appointment,</v>

678
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but no one.</v>

679
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't look hot.</v>

680
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 2>If they look like they're hungry,</v>

681
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you know she's not supposed to look hungry.</v>

682
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to be all nervous because I'm going to</v>

683
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.940
<v Speaker 2>feed this poor kid Jesus Christ rice at the time when he come over,</v>

684
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 2>that idea that these poor models have that.</v>

685
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 2>They have to be coat racks like shit.</v>

686
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.080
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

687
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:23.140
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

688
00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I guys want to be real big.</v>

689
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Most girls aren't in big muscular dude's just other dudes are.</v>

690
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.131
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

691
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 2>There's guys out there that did look at a girl go,</v>

692
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:32.131
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

694
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 2>big tits and like no ass.</v>

695
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a balance thing that I think people recognize and there's one thing that</v>

696
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like big weightlifter dudes do is if no one's coaching them,</v>

697
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 2>they'll get out of fucking balance where they go way titty heavy and way bicep</v>

698
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:52.863
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

699
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:53.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

700
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Then they get these skinny ass next and you're like,</v>

701
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.041
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

702
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I know if the weight goes weird on you,</v>

703
00:19:58.141 --> 00:19:58.891
<v Speaker 2>you can't handle it.</v>

704
00:19:58.891 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Look at that skinny neck.</v>

705
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 2>You have this.</v>

706
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 2>What is holding you together?</v>

707
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Like your pillar that the whole column in the center is made out of dog shit.</v>

708
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't do that.</v>

709
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't have giant biceps and old skinny neck.</v>

710
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:11.994
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>

711
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys that compete in the Olympia.</v>

712
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Phil Heath is my boy,</v>

713
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:16.860

718
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

719
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Or just be a girl.</v>

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 2>There's girls that are like bodybuilder type chicken,</v>

724
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but they're just not that big that just.</v>

725
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:35.551
<v Speaker 2>They just started.</v>

726
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:36.960
<v Speaker 2>They're like a year and a half into it.</v>

727
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

728
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.450
<v Speaker 2>It looks like they're in great shape there.</v>

729
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 2>They're probably going to get too big and a couple of years,</v>

730
00:20:42.721 --> 00:20:44.150
<v Speaker 2>but they're like white belts,</v>

731
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.151
<v Speaker 2>shoulders,</v>

732
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:45.391
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

733
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:46.460
<v Speaker 2>If she has like big shoulders,</v>

734
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.313
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

735
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking</v>

736
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.173
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

737
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

738
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.151
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

739
00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory about why a girl wouldn't be into a big body builder dude.</v>

740
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Like that type of thing wouldn't be bigger.</v>

741
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Is better because I think like evolutionarily,</v>

742
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>like in the girl's DNA,</v>

743
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>she wants a man that can survive and I think in everybody knows that a guy like</v>

744
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

745
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.320
<v Speaker 1>like there's so much maintenance involved first of all,</v>

746
00:21:09.321 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and staying that big.</v>

747
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It's so preposterous.</v>

748
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's so unnatural.</v>

749
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And how many flights of stairs can that guy go up before his heart explodes?</v>

750
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Super Fuck you mean for a regular person like Bill Gates,</v>

751
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:21.470
<v Speaker 1>you bribe.</v>

752
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Been like,</v>

753
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

754
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 1>so your regular athlete at Guy Even the gym,</v>

755
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:25.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I do a few thing these guys don't have.</v>

757
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in comparison to the demands that those fucking bodies have.</v>

758
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.621
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention.</v>

759
00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 1>These bitches are eating fucking chicken breast and asparagus every other hour</v>

760
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and just sweating and sweating,</v>

761
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 1>sweating and have no body fat.</v>

762
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Like they're literally close to blacking out every time they stand up.</v>

763
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>When those guys get down to that shred their asked cheeks have like fucking</v>

764
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:48.934
<v Speaker 1>rubber tire.</v>

765
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.740
<v Speaker 2>You know when girls crossed that threshold of the assets and hip start to lift</v>

766
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 2>so much that it's almost like a guy's muscular ass.</v>

767
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Big Muscular.</v>

768
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:01.884
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>

769
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.530
<v Speaker 2>It's rounded.</v>

770
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Fuck from the profile.</v>

771
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Looks fucking amazing.</v>

772
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>But when you look at it straight back and she's walking like a dude too much</v>

773
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 2>lower bar for sex,</v>

774
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.830
<v Speaker 2>like looks like Shankar went straight on that.</v>

775
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Did I ever tell you about this big 230 pound dude just pumped me in front of a</v>

776
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:23.164
<v Speaker 2>girl before.</v>

777
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.360
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

778
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 2>my aunt hooked me up with this chick.</v>

779
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 2>She used to always tried to hook up with chicks and she's like,</v>

780
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I got a new one for you.</v>

781
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 2>She's at my,</v>

782
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.263
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>

783
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 2>she works with,</v>

784
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Speaker 2>her name is dawn and we're going to go out.</v>

785
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.223
<v Speaker 2>So I went out with.</v>

786
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I went out with dawn and my aunt,</v>

787
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>we went to go meet a guy that my aunt was seen,</v>

788
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but he brings this giant 230 pound linebacker.</v>

789
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.070
<v Speaker 2>And so it's three dudes and chicks.</v>

790
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

791
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.141
<v Speaker 2>there's a little problem.</v>

792
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:50.974
<v Speaker 2>Where at Bennigan's?</v>

793
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

795
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't drinking,</v>

796
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:53.734
<v Speaker 2>so I'm thinking this,</v>

797
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 2>this is probably not going to happen tonight.</v>

798
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So we gotta go on the dance with this girl.</v>

799
00:22:57.411 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 2>So freak,</v>

800
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.800
<v Speaker 2>zero alcohol and she's a freak.</v>

801
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 2>She's all over me making out with me.</v>

805
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.630
<v Speaker 2>that we take a break,</v>

806
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 2>we take a break.</v>

807
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 2>The linebacker comes up and asked her to dance.</v>

808
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>He's on the dance floor,</v>

809
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 2>making out there looking at me,</v>

00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

816
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.690
<v Speaker 2>He owns a scrub.</v>

817
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>The clubs over the lights turn on.</v>

818
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 2>The lights turned on and</v>

819
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 2>he's looking at me and he's leaning against.</v>

820
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure out what we're going to do and he's holding the lights</v>

821
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:36.724

<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

868
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but if the industry was that it was,</v>

876
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.481
<v Speaker 2>I didn't finish it.</v>

877
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:54.060
<v Speaker 2>We get to,</v>

00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 2>We're going to figure out where the hell she lived.</v>

884
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I lost my purpose.</v>

885
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.700

889
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 2>So she was all over me.</v>

890
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:07.820
<v Speaker 2>She was just a wild girl,</v>

893
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:11.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>but this next one's a real.</v>

956
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is where we decide where he's going to go 100</v>

957
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:45.950
<v Speaker 1>off to the races.</v>

958
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 1>The Habib,</v>

959
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Norma madoff where people don't know what the fight is.</v>

960
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Habib number got mad.</v>

961
00:26:49.851 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Office undefeated.</v>

962
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a former world champion and one of the best grapplers in MMA.</v>

963
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.840
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking octopus and he beat the champ already in Dos Anjos.</v>

964
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Seton dos Anjos.</v>

965
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 1>He ragdolled them.</v>

966
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.140
<v Speaker 1>He ragdolled dos Anjos.</v>

967
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And especially the second and third round he starts breaking guys,</v>

968
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.310
<v Speaker 1>but this pressure is fucking takedowns are nasty,</v>

969
00:27:07.311 --> 00:27:07.771
<v Speaker 1>is ground up,</v>

970
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:08.604
<v Speaker 1>house nasty.</v>

971
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 1>He's so dominant in grappling,</v>

972
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but he's coming off that injury,</v>

973
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>a long layoff.</v>

974
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.150
<v Speaker 1>So if there's any time to catch him,</v>

975
00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's now and you know,</v>

976
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>who knows how much damage he had done to his knee because there was more than</v>

977
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>one injury.</v>

978
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.580
<v Speaker 1>There was several injuries,</v>

979
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't just like heard it,</v>

980
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.093
<v Speaker 1>got it repaired,</v>

981
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>did the proper due diligence.</v>

982
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:27.991
<v Speaker 1>And then came back.</v>

983
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:28.651
<v Speaker 1>There was another,</v>

984
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 1>there was another injury I believe during Rehab.</v>

985
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.183
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

986
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 1>he heard it at surgery,</v>

987
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 1>went to Rehab,</v>

988
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:35.911
<v Speaker 1>did all that,</v>

989
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:36.391
<v Speaker 1>got better,</v>

990
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>hurt it again.</v>

991
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 1>So we're dealing with a real problem here.</v>

992
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And it also could be one of the reasons why he's so fucking good.</v>

993
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 1>He's so good because he's relentless for Roche's bulldog.</v>

994
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

995
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:48.771
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

996
00:27:48.771 --> 00:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>That mother,</v>

997
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker doesn't take a step back.</v>

998
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 1>He attacks attacks.</v>

999
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 1>That's all those boys at k though.</v>

1000
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.420
<v Speaker 1>we'll think about it as well.</v>

1002
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 1>But particularly him.</v>

1003
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the grand plan though,</v>

1004
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 1>teams got like that too.</v>

1005
00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:59.870
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1006
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 1>look at his knees and look and look at dc had a knee injury.</v>

1007
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:04.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1008
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.281
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>

1009
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't,</v>

1010
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 1>isn't that like a part of that package,</v>

1011
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 1>like a part of that package is your red line in your body.</v>

1012
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what it comes with the territory.</v>

1013
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1014
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to break some shit.</v>

1015
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Spar DC one time.</v>

1016
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:13.861
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1017
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1018
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are we doing?</v>

1019
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:18.541
<v Speaker 1>Pressure?</v>

1020
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1021
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1022
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 1>just coming around.</v>

1023
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 1>How many want to go shop?</v>

1024
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

1025
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.633
<v Speaker 1>Nah Man,</v>

1026
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool.</v>

1027
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.650
<v Speaker 1>She's just keeps coming.</v>

1028
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.633
<v Speaker 1>Keeps coming.</v>

1029
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen anything like it.</v>

1030
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you work with Kane,</v>

1031
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:33.490
<v Speaker 1>him and Cain both feed off each other and I think that was like a,</v>

1033
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.400
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1034
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 1>like a huge contributing factor to who he is right now.</v>

1035
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100 percent.</v>

1036
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You can get that Olympic drive.</v>

1037
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And when those two get together,</v>

1038
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 1>both of them together just fucking sharpening rockhold into the mix.</v>

1039
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.793
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1040
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And a bunch of other guys there now to touch other guys in there.</v>

1041
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Now where rockhold right now on fire.</v>

1042
00:28:52.651 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a big fight.</v>

1043
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That fucking December's the best fight in middleweight history.</v>

1044
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:57.144
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1046
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1047
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I think other than the vandelay not vandelay other than the Anderson Weidman,</v>

1048
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>the first fight before weidman knocked him out,</v>

1049
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Speaker 1>but before that fight,</v>

1050
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that was the biggest fight in history because Weidman was a crusher.</v>

1051
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 1>We knew why it was a crusher.</v>

1052
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>We saw a whiteman did the Munoz.</v>

1053
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.120
<v Speaker 1>We saw this dude's just looks unstoppable.</v>

1054
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Coffee's shit.</v>

1055
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Super Solid.</v>

1056
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Wrestler,</v>

1057
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 1>knockout power.</v>

1058
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And then Anderson was the motherfucker and we before that fight.</v>

1059
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That was the biggest fight.</v>

1060
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere before that,</v>

1061
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.400
<v Speaker 1>when he got in and I feel like we.</v>

1062
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>We've seen the best that I understand.</v>

1063
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I think now what we did before that was the or fight man,</v>

1064
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.981
<v Speaker 1>the fight before,</v>

1065
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 1>but he chose the matrix.</v>

1066
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1067
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.431
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1068
00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:39.264
<v Speaker 1>I know mom.</v>

1069
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.351
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1070
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:40.690
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1071
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Bonner's at the same level.</v>

1072
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:44.350
<v Speaker 1>But the way he won was so shocked.</v>

1073
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

1074
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified and Banos on some shit and he was on some shit.</v>

1075
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And then before that he had destroyed shale.</v>

1076
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 1>The veto or front kick.</v>

1077
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:52.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1078
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1079
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Anderson hadn't even been in trouble except for the fight fighting.</v>

1080
00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew he came into that fight with injured ribs pretty much after the</v>

1081
00:29:58.991 --> 00:29:59.201
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1082
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:00.034
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew.</v>

1083
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I feel like Weidman's beating dudes in their prime right now</v>

1084
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.860
<v Speaker 1>called beating dudes in the.</v>

1085
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.790
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about fucking monsters and now these two meet the both in</v>

1086
00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 1>the front and Anderson fought Weidman.</v>

1087
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Anderson rather was considered the greatest pound for pound fighter ever.</v>

1088
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.913
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1089
00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point it maybe it was that fight maybe was in camp.</v>

1090
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 1>He lost that.</v>

1091
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>That edge.</v>

1092
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1093
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He could have been that.</v>

1094
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 1>He lost that edge or could it be what Weidman's just that motherfucker.</v>

1095
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.441
<v Speaker 1>He's just.</v>

1096
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 1>That could be that motherfucker,</v>

1097
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but before that fight,</v>

1098
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the biggest fight of all time and I think it still holds up.</v>

1099
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I think this is right up there with them.</v>

1100
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like style ron rankled Weidman's a better style matchup.</v>

1101
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Like why men will.</v>

1102
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:38.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1103
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:39.041
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1104
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1105
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought Anderson Weidman was amazing style.</v>

1106
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Like it's always,</v>

1107
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 1>why am I going to deal with them on the feet?</v>

1108
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.061
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1109
00:30:45.061 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

1110
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I feel because I was going off trail and Anderson and chill could kind of do</v>

1111
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:53.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want and kept taking him down to Kipp Tavi Nick,</v>

1112
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1113
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.530
<v Speaker 1>That first fight first and kind of basically beat him.</v>

1114
00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Then ended up fucking up at the very end again,</v>

1115
00:30:58.811 --> 00:30:59.680
<v Speaker 1>con that triangle.</v>

1116
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm at a better striker than shale,</v>

1117
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.903
<v Speaker 1>better wrestler.</v>

1118
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like you put those together if you wanted to,</v>

1119
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.150
<v Speaker 1>he could make it a boring fight and win that fight every time you got to.</v>

1120
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 1>You got a good point.</v>

1121
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.551
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1122
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:10.181
<v Speaker 1>you've got a good point,</v>

1123
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 1>especially about wyman submission ability,</v>

1124
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.130
<v Speaker 1>who he's nasty.</v>

1125
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 1>He's submission ability is definitely,</v>

1126
00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but channels is underrated.</v>

1127
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Mean did submit shogun and economy.</v>

1128
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:18.431
<v Speaker 1>That gay teen.</v>

1129
00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone expected that shale can submit.</v>

1130
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Guys who did the arm triangle to the arm triangle Stan Stan.</v>

1131
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a motherfucker man.</v>

1132
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:25.391
<v Speaker 1>He's a strong,</v>

1133
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.320
<v Speaker 1>powerful wrestler.</v>

1134
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1135
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:27.360
<v Speaker 1>chase has been,</v>

1136
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 1>had inconsistent performances,</v>

1137
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but like when he was at his best in that Anderson fight,</v>

1138
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

1139
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1140
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.760
<v Speaker 1>he's net.</v>

1141
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.001
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

1142
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:35.020
<v Speaker 1>how about the Marquardt fight?</v>

1143
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking nasty.</v>

1144
00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.243
<v Speaker 1>Mean Chael Sonnen.</v>

1145
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1146
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a title to come.</v>

1147
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I love chill and Weidman is a really good wrestler,</v>

1148
00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:44.290
<v Speaker 1>but I think like chill at his best.</v>

1149
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1150
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He showed the same level of wrestling mobility.</v>

1151
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1152
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but as far as the mixed martial artists,</v>

1153
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 1>that's just mixed martial artist.</v>

1154
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman striking is nasty machita.</v>

1155
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:56.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Much more dangerous with his power.</v>

1157
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>You see the Ryan Hall fight?</v>

1158
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that fight?</v>

1159
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1160
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>

1161
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Has the same left hook.</v>

1162
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:03.611
<v Speaker 1>The same left.</v>

1163
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:04.001
<v Speaker 1>Tosh hails.</v>

1164
00:32:04.001 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Never been like a really good striker.</v>

1165
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.800
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1166
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Really like put it together.</v>

1167
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Chuck GSP style.</v>

1168
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 1>He looked good in the Anderson fight the first round when he caught Anderson</v>

1169
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:12.971
<v Speaker 1>with the straight left.</v>

1170
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:13.180
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1171
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.540
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

1172
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.390
<v Speaker 1>He came out good.</v>

1173
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>But the difference I think is why many laser crusher,</v>

1175
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 1>he crushes guys and we has you hurt.</v>

1176
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 1>He turns into a fucking monster monster.</v>

1177
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>He turns it on and smashes.</v>

1178
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1180
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you saw that in the first year I haul fight.</v>

1181
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it in a punch of the fucking.</v>

1182
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.830
<v Speaker 1>The Munoz fight was one of the most terrifying elbow.</v>

1183
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

1184
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I think Weidman rockhold is definitely a fight for the ages,</v>

1185
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm as excited about that as I was the Anderson Weidman five for some</v>

1186
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:39.801
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1187
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1188
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.680
<v Speaker 4>more excited about it with them.</v>

1189
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 4>I kind of,</v>

1190
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get any more.</v>

1191
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean both of those fights to me like the top of the.</v>

1192
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:46.870
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1193
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I see that.</v>

1194
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.291
<v Speaker 4>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1195
00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is the biggest one ever.</v>

1196
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I think they're both like the same level of huge.</v>

1197
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I think the Anderson Weidman fight is just as big as this,</v>

1198
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:55.870
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1199
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1200
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1201
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 4>that fight was a crazy fight and the way it ended with Anderson Clowning,</v>

1202
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1203
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 4>and why may catch him with that left hook.</v>

1204
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:03.021
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1205
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 4>while it was happening,</v>

1206
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I could not fucking believe my eyes.</v>

1207
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I think it kind of fucked Weidman because no one took him serious and then they</v>

1208
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:10.151
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

1209
00:33:10.151 --> 00:33:10.331
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1210
00:33:10.331 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 4>the rematch then fucking inches like falls off.</v>

1211
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1212
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.611
<v Speaker 4>Then we're like,</v>

1213
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:14.444
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

1214
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 4>but then widen it finally kind of gets his credit when he fights machida.</v>

1215
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1216
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.840
<v Speaker 4>And then he destroys vittorio,</v>

1217
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 4>but he's still like,</v>

1218
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1219
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 4>To me should be the biggest star in the UFC.</v>

1220
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1221
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 4>All American dude beats the very best at one 85.</v>

1222
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck what division one to talk about.</v>

1223
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.901
<v Speaker 4>One 85.</v>

1224
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:30.734
<v Speaker 4>He's American.</v>

1225
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 4>He speaks well.</v>

1226
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 4>He's Super Smart,</v>

1227
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:32.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1228
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 4>He's a family guy.</v>

1229
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why it's not a bigger star.</v>

1230
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.740
<v Speaker 4>You got a really good point,</v>

1231
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1232
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good point.</v>

1233
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not like he doesn't have the ability.</v>

1234
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.251
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1235
00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:43.780
<v Speaker 4>He's like fucking are Nolan Ryan saying you think it's because he likes school</v>

1236
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 4>rep?</v>

1237
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Just don't know what it is.</v>

1238
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 4>He's not a shit talker.</v>

1239
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1240
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Ricky's not a big shit talker,</v>

1241
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1242
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.460
<v Speaker 4>inside the gun.</v>

1243
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.070
<v Speaker 4>He is a mother fucker.</v>

1244
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:53.391
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1245
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 4>He's got something.</v>

1246
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 4>There's something about him that you can tell.</v>

1247
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Like when guys go into it with him,</v>

1248
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.100
<v Speaker 4>like they see it on them.</v>

1249
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:00.940
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1250
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.551
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

1251
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:01.891
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's.</v>

1252
00:34:01.891 --> 00:34:02.270
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1253
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 4>There's a few guys like that.</v>

1254
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:04.031
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>

1255
00:34:04.031 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 4>when guys lock eyes with them to see it in them.</v>

1256
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1257
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 4>And he's one of those and that's why the Anderson stare down with him was so</v>

1258
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 4>interesting when Anderson got mouth to mouth with him and Wyman looked and he</v>

1259
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:13.791
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

1260
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:14.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not afraid of you dude.</v>

1261
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

1262
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 4>But there was a reality to it.</v>

1263
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 4>There was a reality to it that Anderson was like,</v>

1264
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

1265
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:20.601
<v Speaker 4>Some shit.</v>

1266
00:34:20.601 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 4>What have I done know?</v>

1267
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Weidman wants to fight at a.</v>

1268
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.020
<v Speaker 4>He wants to fight Jon Jones,</v>

1269
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.533
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones.</v>

1270
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 4>And he thinks he can beat them.</v>

1271
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Well it's illegal.</v>

1272
00:34:30.081 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 4>And Jon Jones had some shit going.</v>

1273
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:32.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1274
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:33.081
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1275
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on with the John Jones situation,</v>

1276
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 4>but I know he comes fresh out of prison.</v>

1277
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Beats the fuck out of anyone in the world.</v>

1278
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 4>He might not have to go to prison.</v>

1279
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.890
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys think about?</v>

1280
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Knows we haven't talked about the rules are to you?</v>

1281
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1282
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.640
<v Speaker 4>I wish them that.</v>

1283
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.471
<v Speaker 4>I want to see him back,</v>

1284
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:45.920
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1285
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.070
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want them to keep telling this kind of behavior.</v>

1286
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:51.580
<v Speaker 4>I think I liked John at his best.</v>

1287
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.270
<v Speaker 4>John's a fucking really interesting,</v>

1288
00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 4>intelligent guy with a crazy amount of stress,</v>

1289
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>a crazy amount of responsibility.</v>

1290
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.320
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have a fighter like given the UFC right now.</v>

1291
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 4>We just don't.</v>

1292
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1293
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.220
<v Speaker 4>he's definitely different than everybody else.</v>

1294
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.630
<v Speaker 4>What about Nick Diaz?</v>

1295
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys feel about that?</v>

1296
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst travesty I've ever heard of an ego thing in any of the</v>

1297
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 4>regulatory decisions that I've ever heard about the center getting involved as</v>

1298
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:17.324
<v Speaker 4>well that you're talking.</v>

1299
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

1300
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.750
<v Speaker 4>they took his livelihood from five years for me that they did it based on one</v>

1301
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 4>test that's not nearly as accurate as the other two tests.</v>

1302
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 4>The other two tests which were run by the world antidoping agency,</v>

1303
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 4>the ones that take blood,</v>

1304
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.670
<v Speaker 4>those are way more accurate and those.</v>

1305
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 4>He passed two of them.</v>

1306
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.530
<v Speaker 4>He passed two of those blood cells</v>

1307
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 1>and then they take this urine test and they run it through this laboratory,</v>

1308
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 1>but urine is just not nearly as accurate.</v>

1309
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:45.984
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>

1310
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.590
<v Speaker 1>So them getting on him for that is fucking crazy.</v>

1311
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1312
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:50.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1313
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they were upset that he took the fifth.</v>

1314
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1315
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.481
<v Speaker 1>Four minutes.</v>

1316
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Fifty six seconds right now in the cocoon.</v>

1317
00:35:56.711 --> 00:35:56.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1318
00:35:56.811 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Diego Brandao fight.</v>

1319
00:35:57.841 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting fight.</v>

1320
00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.251
<v Speaker 1>Cocoon.</v>

1321
00:35:59.251 --> 00:35:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1322
00:35:59.321 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 1>have you never seen him before?</v>

1323
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 1>He's got a weird style.</v>

1324
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 1>A style that does not work.</v>

1325
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody will.</v>

1326
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson lit him up with Tony.</v>

1327
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:08.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1328
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:09.690
<v Speaker 1>He got cracked again.</v>

1329
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Bombs.</v>

1330
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1331
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.720
<v Speaker 1>She goes ragdoll.</v>

1332
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1333
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up.</v>

1334
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:17.671
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1335
00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:18.001
<v Speaker 1>Diego.</v>

1336
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:18.834
<v Speaker 1>Brandao.</v>

1337
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1338
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.001
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1339
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Vicious stoppage.</v>

1340
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Diego Brandao.</v>

1341
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.630
<v Speaker 1>That was Tommy hearns.</v>

1342
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Hagler and shit.</v>

1343
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1344
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.121
<v Speaker 1>Beat down.</v>

1345
00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And Tommy hearns.</v>

1346
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Hagler went a full round.</v>

1347
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not.</v>

1348
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Went into the second round when God was open.</v>

1349
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Coon iced.</v>

1350
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:34.951
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1351
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the drawing board.</v>

1352
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1353
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.103
<v Speaker 1>Put your hands up.</v>

1354
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:37.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1355
00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:37.831
<v Speaker 1>cocoon.</v>

1356
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1357
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.560
<v Speaker 1>he used to have um,</v>

1358
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of success with that.</v>

1359
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He has like a 45 degree front kick that he throws.</v>

1360
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it or it's like a combination of a roundhouse kick and a front</v>

1361
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:47.941
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>

1362
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

1363
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.250
<v Speaker 1>He hit guys right in the liver with it.</v>

1364
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nasty,</v>

1365
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1366
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

1367
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.440
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it before you.</v>

1368
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 1>The one who told me about it,</v>

1369
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you were the first one who told me,</v>

1370
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but you feel like you like.</v>

1371
00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen this guy in Japan?</v>

1372
00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.480
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing this kick.</v>

1373
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 1>You Go.</v>

1374
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a roundhouse kick,</v>

1375
00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:02.610
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't like a front kick.</v>

1376
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like something different.</v>

1377
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's in between and he started like A.</v>

1378
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1379
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 1>like a side snapping front.</v>

1380
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Snap kick to the balls of your feet to deliver.</v>

1381
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>

1382
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1383
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 1>When you throw a round kick,</v>

1384
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 1>when you throw around Kyc and you hit with the Shin,</v>

1385
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most powerful way you can throw it because your foot doesn't</v>

1386
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:21.234
<v Speaker 1>give in.</v>

1387
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Like when you throw a kick with your foot,</v>

1388
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 1>your foot kind of gives a little and you can hurt someone,</v>

1389
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not nearly as effective with like the ball of the foot as it is with</v>

1390
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:30.610
<v Speaker 1>the heel.</v>

1391
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 1>The heel is way more effective because the heel doesn't have any give like this.</v>

1392
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You can have a little bit of resistance because of your foot and it's like</v>

1393
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.920
<v Speaker 1>hitting someone almost like with like a cushion behind it.</v>

1394
00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1395
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but the way cocoon was doing it,</v>

1396
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he had done it so many times and his technique was so sharp.</v>

1397
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 1>There was not much movement in his foot and when he would pull his foot back,</v>

1398
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

1399
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 1>really dig the ball of the foot in.</v>

1401
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 1>There was like really high level stuff.</v>

1402
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of cool Christian guys are really good at that.</v>

1403
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>They develop that ability to throw those front snap kicks with like they just,</v>

1404
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.311
<v Speaker 1>it gets.</v>

1405
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 1>So the technique,</v>

1406
00:38:04.171 --> 00:38:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it's so sharp that at the end of it they're so good at like thrusting the ball</v>

1407
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:08.590
<v Speaker 1>of the foot in there.</v>

1408
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's another one of those kicks ban.</v>

1410
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to see more of a cowboy uses that a lot now.</v>

1411
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.640
<v Speaker 1>He used that on Jim Miller.</v>

1412
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>He's thrown that front kick to the body,</v>

1413
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but you're so same thing.</v>

1414
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.840
<v Speaker 1>You're hitting the guy with the ball of the foot and bonded it.</v>

1415
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Connor did it to Chad on or did it Kinda.</v>

1416
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Does it align the body?</v>

1417
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1418
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Anderson did face.</v>

1419
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1420
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.103
<v Speaker 1>Anderson did it.</v>

1421
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 1>He was the first time is aiming just for the liver,</v>

1422
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't done it.</v>

1423
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to say he's done it a few times in Japan and he's got some hands do</v>

1424
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.453
<v Speaker 1>that he liked.</v>

1425
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 1>He has a great combo where he'll open you up with hands and then he'll just to</v>

1426
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 1>land that thing and then vice versa.</v>

1427
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:41.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1428
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 1>he hit Tony in that fight.</v>

1429
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean he definitely caught Tony with some good shop.</v>

1430
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Tony can take a punch to man.</v>

1431
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I just think Tony Hits even harder.</v>

1432
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1433
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

1434
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.140
<v Speaker 1>she might be the hardest hitter.</v>

1435
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.860
<v Speaker 1>This weight for Rochus.</v>

1436
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson's ferocious.</v>

1437
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1438
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 1>back to that ds thing though.</v>

1439
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:56.760
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1440
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.593
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>

1441
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.330
<v Speaker 1>What can you do?</v>

1442
00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I think they do.</v>

1443
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I think they take it to court and I think they win easy.</v>

1444
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a problem with winning.</v>

1445
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at the facts,</v>

1446
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.371
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>

1447
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1448
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.730
<v Speaker 1>he passed to water tests that are much more stringent.</v>

1449
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.163
<v Speaker 1>The fact that,</v>

1450
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1451
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1452
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:12.821
<v Speaker 1>there's a threshold,</v>

1453
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 1>like they don't want you to be high while you're competing.</v>

1454
00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that's reasonable.</v>

1455
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.461
<v Speaker 1>What the thresholds are.</v>

1456
00:39:17.461 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Very low threshold is so low or so high rather than like you could have smoked</v>

1457
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:27.170
<v Speaker 1>pot a couple of days ago and you should pass according to Jeff Novitsky and Jeff</v>

1458
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.521
<v Speaker 1>Novitsky should know.</v>

1459
00:39:27.521 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1460
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.983
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1461
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1462
00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I think they're reasonable about it.</v>

1463
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I think what's reasonable or unreasonable is they're not willing to take into</v>

1464
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 1>consideration those other two tests.</v>

1465
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:36.521
<v Speaker 1>Like give.</v>

1466
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 1>There were reason like if they looked at the chain of custody from the time,</v>

1467
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 1>like the blood was drawn,</v>

1468
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>it was all done to the water standard,</v>

1469
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.151
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1470
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:43.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1471
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 1>world anti-doping,</v>

1472
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:44.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1473
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 1>If it was done to that standard,</v>

1474
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 1>they should accept that those are better,</v>

1475
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.040
<v Speaker 1>more stringent tests and in fact they shouldn't even need to perform their own</v>

1476
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>tests as long as there's no suspicion of corruption.</v>

1477
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no suspicion that someone's changing results are trying to protect a</v>

1478
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 1>fighter in the UFC doesn't do that.</v>

1479
00:39:59.620 --> 00:39:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1480
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 1>it'd be if they did.</v>

1481
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1482
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 1>she looked at all the different people that have been popped,</v>

1483
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1484
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't want those guys pop.</v>

1485
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Although did you hear the bell for thing?</v>

1486
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear that thing?</v>

1487
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to bring that up.</v>

1488
00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:09.904
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1489
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1490
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.593
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1491
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.321
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying.</v>

1492
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:13.531
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1493
00:40:13.531 --> 00:40:14.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1494
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're friends with Lorenzo,</v>

1495
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>well he had um,</v>

1496
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.950
<v Speaker 1>apparently they had accidentally sent out some results of one of vittores tests</v>

1497
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:28.000
<v Speaker 1>before he fought Jon Jones and he had been flagged as having high testosterone,</v>

1498
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is while he had a testosterone exemption.</v>

1499
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think the issue is not that he used testosterone.</v>

1500
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I think he was allowed to then that was back when the UFC was kind of involved</v>

1501
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:39.450
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1502
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>They were allowed to have testosterone use exemptions.</v>

1503
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1504
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

1505
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't correct.</v>

1506
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was doing anything illegal.</v>

1507
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just high.</v>

1508
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think like that they were talking about it in an article I read that the</v>

1509
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 1>doctor would tell you like say if you're the upper upper threshold is like</v>

1510
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:55.831
<v Speaker 1>$1,200,</v>

1511
00:40:55.831 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently like really crazy,</v>

1512
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1513
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 1>If the doctor saw that you were 1100,</v>

1514
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:00.401
<v Speaker 1>when they test you,</v>

1515
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:00.461
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1516
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:00.671
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1517
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:00.911
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1518
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:01.744
<v Speaker 1>you're a little high,</v>

1519
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 1>like 10 above 10 is high.</v>

1520
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So we want you to drop your dose down a little bit and that that's what their</v>

1521
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:07.361
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

1522
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 1>What do we know what Victoria was that?</v>

1523
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Well I know at one point he was tested at 1475.</v>

1524
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1525
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Which is like super silver back.</v>

1526
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla Hyena.</v>

1527
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Dick fucked up.</v>

1528
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 1>But people have tested real high before.</v>

1529
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean Nate Marquardt was actually pulled out of a fight.</v>

1530
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Rick's Charlie Brennaman,</v>

1531
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Brenham,</v>

1532
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>and took his place last minute and one against Rick Story.</v>

1533
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucking fight.</v>

1534
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Biggest fight of his career.</v>

1535
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>And they pulled it out because of Israel results.</v>

1536
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>

1537
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>

1538
00:41:37.971 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

1539
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Like he had an exemption.</v>

1540
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1541
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at his results and they're like,</v>

1542
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:42.074
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1543
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>What and what are you doing?</v>

1544
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.023
<v Speaker 1>I know nate,</v>

1545
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you know I,</v>

1546
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.380
<v Speaker 1>well I know the,</v>

1547
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.343
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1548
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:54.330
<v Speaker 1>tough titers when fighters are relying on Dr who's another ego you don't like</v>

1549
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.693
<v Speaker 1>who the uh,</v>

1550
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.780
<v Speaker 1>could you tell him how much did to.</v>

1551
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

1552
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>

1553
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how much he's going to take to put him in.</v>

1554
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>His legal limit is his doctor now is Dr. gives them the same amount every week</v>

1555
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 1>and then he's giving it to them on a Monday and nate's getting tested on a</v>

1556
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:10.394
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>

1557
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.440
<v Speaker 1>He's had a chance for his levels to naturally go lower go.</v>

1558
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>But when a guy's about to fight,</v>

1559
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 1>the Dr. May likely say for best performance,</v>

1560
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to fight at your best,</v>

1561
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you should have it as high as possible.</v>

1562
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So take your injection right before your way in or something along those lines</v>

1563
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and that way it'll be at its peak the next day.</v>

1564
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Or even if you're used to getting a shot on Monday and you're flying out to the</v>

1565
00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:32.661
<v Speaker 1>client on Tuesday,</v>

1566
00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you do a daily can fuck with the results.</v>

1567
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:36.270
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that nate's not used to it.</v>

1568
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1569
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that like when he was at the peak,</v>

1570
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:44.380
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it's peak was that if that was normal that he was taken at that</v>

1571
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.671
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1572
00:42:44.671 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>like that's not even human.</v>

1573
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.113
<v Speaker 1>Like these are high,</v>

1574
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 1>what you call hyper human levels with doctors refer to as a hyper human level.</v>

1575
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So you get to certain levels like 15,</v>

1576
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 1>1600 and you're like Jesus Christ,</v>

1577
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you go into those freak bodybuilder levels.</v>

1578
00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 1>What are the real pillars that those guys want to go?</v>

1579
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 1>They're not even human.</v>

1580
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 1>They take so much growth.</v>

1581
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.233
<v Speaker 1>They're not there.</v>

1582
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:10.370
<v Speaker 1>They're so ridiculously muscular and so just overwhelmingly cartoonishly</v>

1583
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.253
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1584
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at just dry age.</v>

1585
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.330
<v Speaker 1>They get addicted to that man and I look at those guys and I think what's the</v>

1586
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 1>end of the road like for those guys?</v>

1587
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Like how long can you run it at that?</v>

1588
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think you just get fat after awhile.</v>

1589
00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:25.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Homeboy from England.</v>

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.720
<v Speaker 1>A dorian yates is one of the best of all time.</v>

1598
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 1>He's fit healthy.</v>

1599
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.063

1603
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 1>He's thick like an athlete,</v>

00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:40.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1608
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1609
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 1>he's super open about it.</v>

1610
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Talks about all the shitty took,</v>

1611
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:45.200
<v Speaker 1>talks about what everybody does.</v>

1612
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:45.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1613
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:49.070
<v Speaker 1>he's super open about it to tells you exactly what his dosage were.</v>

1614
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:49.691
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't,</v>

1615
00:43:49.691 --> 00:43:49.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1616
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't any higher than anybody else,</v>

1617
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but he also highlights that the reason why he got so good,</v>

1618
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 1>the reason why he was Mr Olympia was he was willing to fucking work harder.</v>

1619
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't just the drop.</v>

1620
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:00.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1621
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:01.244
<v Speaker 1>they're all in June.</v>

1622
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.840
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

1623
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference.</v>

1624
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a work ethic.</v>

1625
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.633
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1626
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 1>not a sport,</v>

1627
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 1>not a sport,</v>

1628
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.060
<v Speaker 1>not a spectator sport.</v>

1629
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It's something different.</v>

1630
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to put it,</v>

1631
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1632

<v Speaker 1>like how can you say that?</v>

1633
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>That is like boxing.</v>

1634
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Boxing is a sport.</v>

1635
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Soccer as a sport,</v>

1636
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:14.743
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to win,</v>

1637

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to do something faster and move quicker when you don't move like</v>

1639
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:19.471
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>like you know that when you think about</v>

1725
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Guerrilla marketing can become an addict.</v>

1726
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 4>They're so good and you're healthy.</v>

1727
00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Delicious.</v>

1728
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Pickles are good for you.</v>

1729
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.290
<v Speaker 4>They're like one of those weird snacks where you're,</v>

1730
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.850
<v Speaker 4>it's okay to eat bad about it.</v>

1731
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.361
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1732
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:19.194
<v Speaker 4>the pickle juice,</v>

1733
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 4>I want to have sugar in them.</v>

1734
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 4>But the pickle juice people drink for electrolytes.</v>

1735
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 4>We used to have it on the sidelines.</v>

1736
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.633
<v Speaker 4>This is um,</v>

1737
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 4>this is the tyrone tyron Woodley.</v>

1738
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Johny Hendricks fight.</v>

1739
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Didn't,</v>

1740
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.120
<v Speaker 4>didn't woodley say that Johnny Hendricks bit him.</v>

1741
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Denise say bit him or some shit.</v>

1742
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

1743
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.013
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1744
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.063
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

1745
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:41.731
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

1746
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:42.421
<v Speaker 4>you know my band.</v>

1747
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 4>That's like a frozen moment in time.</v>

1748
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 4>It's real hard unless you see the actual video of what it looked like when the</v>

1749
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:51.480
<v Speaker 4>hand made contact with the face because everybody knows that like in the middle</v>

1750
00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:52.930
<v Speaker 4>of a crazy grappling censorship,</v>

1751
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 4>occasionally a hand will go where it's not supposed to go.</v>

1752
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit if you can kind of shape.</v>

1753
00:46:57.531 --> 00:46:57.931
<v Speaker 4>He is in.</v>

1754
00:46:57.931 --> 00:46:58.764
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1755
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 4>You'll throw both in amazing shape on both amazing fighters.</v>

1756
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a really interesting fight.</v>

1757
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1758
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Woodley is a training a lot now with.</v>

1759
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm a duke.</v>

1760
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.970
<v Speaker 4>Duke roufus help is striking out.</v>

1761
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.100
<v Speaker 4>That's his biggest profits is striking really well.</v>

1762
00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it's this problem.</v>

1763
00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:15.654
<v Speaker 4>I think he's,</v>

1764
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 4>I think his,</v>

1765
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:22.670
<v Speaker 4>he's almost got like too much of a gift in his power and speed and when you use</v>

1766
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 4>that gift,</v>

1767
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.920
<v Speaker 4>you know he can do shit like the way he can move.</v>

1768
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 4>He can move as fast as anybody through faster than anybody,</v>

1769
00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 4>but that requires a lot</v>

1770
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.680
<v Speaker 1>of energy and you gotta know when to do it,</v>

1771
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 1>when not to too long.</v>

1772
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1773
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>so I think he has,</v>

1774
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:35.411
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

1775
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:35.940
<v Speaker 1>he has a.</v>

1776
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 1>it's compared to a guy who doesn't have that kind of horsepower.</v>

1777
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 1>He has a like a unique situation.</v>

1778
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We have to.</v>

1779
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.620
<v Speaker 1>He has to figure out when to sprint and when to lay back and I think you saw way</v>

1780
00:47:47.621 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 1>more than the Calvin Gaslin fight and that was a fight that he worked with Duke.</v>

1781
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Duke is like such a smart,</v>

1782
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 1>polished striker that I think tyra can only get better training with him,</v>

1783
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

1784
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.610
<v Speaker 1>what's scary about that dude is always that,</v>

1785
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that fucking bum rush,</v>

1786
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:01.331
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1787
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:01.511
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1788
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he has to do with Woodley.</v>

1789
00:48:03.941 --> 00:48:04.511
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he say,</v>

1790
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:04.841
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1791
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 1>let's drag this into rounds and try and be Johnny Hendricks.</v>

1792
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:08.250
<v Speaker 1>You ain't gonna beat.</v>

1793
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.011
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think?</v>

1794
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I think you.</v>

1795
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 1>You get better at everything.</v>

1796
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.981
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

1797
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think like saying,</v>

1798
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:13.091
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1799
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the only way you can win this is a sprint.</v>

1800
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that guy is getting better and I think they're all think you can up his</v>

1801
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 1>cardio 100 percent.</v>

1802
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I really changes his approach.</v>

1803
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Changes his approach.</v>

1804
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Just slightly be a little bit more efficient and you know,</v>

1805
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.560
<v Speaker 1>just know when to sprint when night.</v>

1806
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes with experience too.</v>

1807
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't agree.</v>

1808
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot of fights though.</v>

1809
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 1>It does have a lot of fights,</v>

1810
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1811
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 1>coming into it as a wrestler,</v>

1812
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the actual amount of strikelee here,</v>

1813
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:36.821
<v Speaker 1>you seem like,</v>

1814
00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 1>look how fast fuck Jesus fucking monster.</v>

1815
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I think when you look at his actual striking experience though,</v>

1816
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as much as say his grappling experience.</v>

1817
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.420
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>

1818
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:46.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1819
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 1>so he's got to catch up and certain what?</v>

1820
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.570
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy fight.</v>

1821
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.523
<v Speaker 1>Him contact.</v>

1822
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:51.363
<v Speaker 1>Jesus cried.</v>

1823
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.181
<v Speaker 1>That was the big one.</v>

1824
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 1>The J here on fight.</v>

1825
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 1>That was the one where you say,</v>

1826
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:55.141
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1827
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:56.520
<v Speaker 1>if this to his bum rushes you,</v>

1828
00:48:56.521 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa fucking terrifying problem.</v>

1829
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Speaker 1>But then it didn't work in the Rory Macdonald Fight,</v>

1830
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Rory Macdonald figured out a way how to solve the riddle that is that big right</v>

1831
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:06.440
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

1832
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 1>And the bum rush kept his hands up high and did that.</v>

1833
00:49:09.671 --> 00:49:09.791
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1834
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:10.091
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1835
00:49:10.091 --> 00:49:10.201
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1836
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the extension thing with his arms,</v>

1837
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 1>he's thrown a lot of jams going to drag in the later rounds.</v>

1838
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:14.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1839
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 1>rory avoided all the craziness.</v>

1840
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:17.621
<v Speaker 1>Craziness.</v>

1841
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1842
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

1843
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.390
<v Speaker 1>That's Ross do of Rasa.</v>

1844
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Hobbies,</v>

1845
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.230
<v Speaker 1>a wizard east.</v>

1846
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Every seat is breakdowns.</v>

1847
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 1>He breaks down fights and talks about technique and why guys are good at.</v>

1848
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my favorite casino as far as MMA coaches go.</v>

1849
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:30.723
<v Speaker 1>He's number one.</v>

1850
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.720
<v Speaker 1>He's the best I've ever been mad.</v>

1851
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:33.251
<v Speaker 1>He was pretty.</v>

1852
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 1>God damn good too.</v>

1853
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 1>He's revolutionizing,</v>

1854
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 1>revolutionizing,</v>

1855
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.050
<v Speaker 1>revolutionizing guard point.</v>

1856
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1857
00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1858
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I still think about his guys,</v>

1859
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.910
<v Speaker 1>GSP now and then Roy Mcdonald.</v>

1860
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 1>He's had those guys since day one.</v>

1861
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:47.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1862
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a few guys right now that I think they're all in the mix.</v>

1863
00:49:50.141 --> 00:49:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I think you're born mark Henry's in the mix for sure.</v>

1864
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1865
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He's so underrated that guy,</v>

1866
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but he's all striking.</v>

1867
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous.</v>

1868
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxers great blocks or I'm just talking about like straight MMA.</v>

1869
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Coach Monster Wrestle in college too.</v>

1870
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.213
<v Speaker 1>He did something,</v>

1871
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>but you know what dude?</v>

1872
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:10.300
<v Speaker 1>How do you fuck with Matt Hume?</v>

1873
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:10.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1874
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 1>look at Matt Hume's best student.</v>

1875
00:50:11.981 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 1>His best student is pound for pound.</v>

1876
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>The best guy on the planet earth today made my mouth may be fighting my maybe</v>

1877
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:21.040
<v Speaker 1>fighting guys that are small and they may be sued or not.</v>

1878
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Not the same sort of a talent pool,</v>

1879
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell me John Dodson is a mother fucker.</v>

1880
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.050
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker.</v>

1881
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 1>John Dodson is a Goddamn motherfucker and mighty mouse.</v>

1882
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:35.591
<v Speaker 1>Shut him down and did so in the most efficient and impressive way I've ever</v>

1883
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:36.120
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

1884
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mouse is terribly got here.</v>

1885
00:50:37.511 --> 00:50:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not my number one,</v>

1886
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 1>top five.</v>

1887
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1888
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:39.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1889
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1890
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:40.543
<v Speaker 1>it's all subjective.</v>

1891
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>

1892
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but he's my number one.</v>

1893
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the best.</v>

1894
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So and you watch mad human him work together and you watch all the strategy</v>

1895
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 1>that's involved and other thinking and all the technique and the work.</v>

1896
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a mother.</v>

1897
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Those two guys,</v>

1898
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1899
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a super team.</v>

1900
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ for Rasa.</v>

1901
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Hobby and Matt Hume on the same team.</v>

1902
00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:57.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1903
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 1>what's impressive with Matt Hume is at that at the La lighter weight.</v>

1904
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to be good at fucking everything.</v>

1905
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 1>No holes,</v>

1906
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>no zero holes and mighty mouse has that.</v>

1907
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 1>He's going to.</v>

1908
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 1>He's a black belt and everything.</v>

1909
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Worldclass and everything.</v>

1910
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.191
<v Speaker 1>He saw so,</v>

1911
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:12.860
<v Speaker 1>so fucking sneaky man.</v>

1912
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 1>He's so sneaky like going.</v>

1913
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:19.900
<v Speaker 1>He's when he's moving on those dudes like when I'm watching him move on dots and</v>

1914
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm like this motherfucker in his foot work like it's never the same beat.</v>

1915
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.341
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1916
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not like one to one,</v>

1917
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1918
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.933
<v Speaker 1>one to.</v>

1919
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1920
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 1>there's all this sporadic shit that your brain has to try to process and that's</v>

1921
00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 1>something that for Ross has talked about too,</v>

1922
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:40.841
<v Speaker 1>like overloading a dude's mind with possibilities and I think for us it's really</v>

1923
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the only guy I've ever heard articulated,</v>

1924
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.840
<v Speaker 1>but you can see it in the movements of mighty mouse.</v>

1925
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>That's clearly what they're trying to initiate,</v>

1926
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:47.091
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1927
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about Chris Weidman needs to do something.</v>

1928
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mouse.</v>

1929
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:52.090
<v Speaker 1>We gotta figure something out.</v>

1930
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Something we'd a gimmick.</v>

1931
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he comes in with a Cape.</v>

1932
00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.630
<v Speaker 1>We got to do something,</v>

1933
00:51:59.631 --> 00:51:59.961
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1934
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:00.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1935
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:00.291
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1936
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure something out.</v>

1937
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I just hope if we keep talking about on people eventually figured it out.</v>

1938
00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think for mighty mouse.</v>

1939
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Henry Cejudo who knows a big fight,</v>

1940
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 1>but now Henry so who says he won't fight in Vegas?</v>

1941
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and Nick Diaz and he don't smoke weed.</v>

1942
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even smoke weed,</v>

1943
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.300
<v Speaker 1>but if for him it's a matter of principle.</v>

1944
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.490
<v Speaker 1>If all every UFC fighter should do this,</v>

1945
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you want to make a fucking change.</v>

1946
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:21.201
<v Speaker 1>Just say,</v>

1947
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:21.381
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1948
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:22.440
<v Speaker 1>we're not fighting in Vegas.</v>

1949
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:22.911
<v Speaker 1>I'll change it.</v>

1950
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:23.241
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

1951
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:23.871
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll just say,</v>

1952
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I think they would.</v>

1953
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.191
<v Speaker 1>There's so much money.</v>

1954
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 1>You think they're going to change it?</v>

1955
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.073
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1956
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to lose the lawsuit.</v>

1957
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1958
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that for real,</v>

1959
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:31.670
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to go,</v>

1960
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:31.811
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1961
00:52:31.811 --> 00:52:32.450
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

1962
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.530
<v Speaker 1>They can't let this happen.</v>

1963
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 1>The key,</v>

1964
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.671
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1965
00:52:34.671 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 1>they've already lost when they had a lifetime ban on vandelay Silva,</v>

1966
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:38.803
<v Speaker 1>they lost that.</v>

1967
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1968
00:52:39.951 --> 00:52:42.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't give a guy a lifetime ban.</v>

1969
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't callously take away a man's livelihood when he didn't even test</v>

1970
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

1971
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1972
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay didn't.</v>

1973
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 1>You didn't do the right thing by avoiding the task.</v>

1974
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 1>He brought it up.</v>

1975
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>He ran.</v>

1976
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>

1977
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what he was on.</v>

1978
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the situation was.</v>

1979
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:56.990
<v Speaker 1>We know what he said.</v>

1980
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1981
00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.453
<v Speaker 1>We're just.</v>

1982
00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 1>But all I'm saying is we lay it out.</v>

1983
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to punish them for sure.</v>

1984
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1985
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some sort of punishment,</v>

1986
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of taking away the man's livelihood as a punishment for escaping a</v>

1987
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>drug test that if he was positive for would only get at the time,</v>

1988
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a nine month suspension that was mandatory.</v>

1989
00:53:15.681 --> 00:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1990
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1991
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:18.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a tyranny,</v>

1992
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.521
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

1993
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Just these Fox who checked as piss and blood of the baddest.</v>

1994
00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Sue's not planet,</v>

1995
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 1>just trying to flex their muscle.</v>

1996
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 2>They go home at night like,</v>

1997
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:27.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1998
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:28.171
<v Speaker 2>he's banned for life.</v>

1999
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I fuck that dude.</v>

2000
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:29.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2001
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:29.971
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>

2002
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:30.211
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2003
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same problem that we have with cops.</v>

2004
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:33.061
<v Speaker 2>In a lot of ways.</v>

2005
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:33.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2006
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a game of trying to win because trying like when you hear about</v>

2007
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:42.291
<v Speaker 2>prosecutors and when you hear about like cops that are like hiding evidence and</v>

2008
00:53:42.571 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 2>prosecutors that are avoiding avoiding evidence or they withdraw evidence that</v>

2009
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 2>shows that they're the person that they're trying to convict may be innocent.</v>

2010
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2011
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.390
<v Speaker 2>You hear about those stories.</v>

2012
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:51.571
<v Speaker 2>You go,</v>

2013
00:53:51.571 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 2>how could someone do that?</v>

2014
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.470
<v Speaker 2>It's an ego thing too.</v>

2015
00:53:53.471 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 2>That will also because they want the score,</v>

2016
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.453
<v Speaker 2>they want to win.</v>

2017
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Why do people cheat when it comes to like card games or pool?</v>

2018
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.201
<v Speaker 2>Why do they do there?</v>

2019
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 2>They do it because they want to.</v>

2020
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 2>When it becomes a score thing and when you're arresting people,</v>

2021
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.110
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a score so fucked up,</v>

2022
00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2023
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Fucking place.</v>

2024
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Think about.</v>

2025
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Think about if all the founders got together like,</v>

2026
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 2>you know what you want to treat our boy nick Diaz like this.</v>

2027
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 2>We're not fucking fighting in Vegas,</v>

2028
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.900
<v Speaker 2>but the big dogs,</v>

2029
00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.393

2034
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:23.641
<v Speaker 2>We're not coming.</v>

2035
00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 2>They're mighty mouse.</v>

2036
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 2>We see fucking change really,</v>

2037
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

2038
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were disappointed in something mighty mouse had earlier this</v>

2039
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:29.581
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

2040
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really.</v>

2041
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>The said he would fight,</v>

2042
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.420
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

2043
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2044
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 2>there was a quote that people were upset about,</v>

2045
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 2>a very particular quote.</v>

2046
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2047
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2048
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what it was.</v>

2049
00:54:37.621 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>

2050
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:38.821
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

2051
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:39.654
<v Speaker 2>I wanna um,</v>

2052
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.273

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:46.370
<v Speaker 2>can we get my mouth on pr guy something conor Mcgregor and is there some shit?</v>

2054
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's wrong.</v>

2055
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 2>What about that case where those kids in paradise lost.</v>

2056
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>

2057
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:56.840
<v Speaker 2>they get accused of murdering these boys in the woods because they thought that</v>

2058
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 2>the dumb ass cops in the small town,</v>

2059
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:02.020
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was a satanic ritual because they're there.</v>

2060
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.440
<v Speaker 2>The animals would come and make eat the balls.</v>

2061
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 2>And the documentary talking about Dr. that documentary,</v>

2062
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Paradise lost.</v>

2063
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:10.630
<v Speaker 2>You got to see this and the animals would eat the balls and the dicks.</v>

2064
00:55:10.631 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 2>So they thought that these guys say tannic.</v>

2065
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So they went to the high school and found the goth kids and fucking prosecuted</v>

2066
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2067
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to the boys?</v>

2068
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 2>They were in jail for like 17 boys who got their dicks eat and how they die.</v>

2069
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:23.903
<v Speaker 2>They ended up,</v>

2070
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 2>they got their ticks eat.</v>

2071
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Now they got murdered,</v>

2072
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.691
<v Speaker 2>they got murdered,</v>

2073
00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

2074
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 2>they went after the goth kids because it was a satanic murder.</v>

2075
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:32.011
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

2076
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>who knows who did it that was ever convicted.</v>

2077
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 2>They never,</v>

2078
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>never found the guys.</v>

2079
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:36.040
<v Speaker 2>But there's like,</v>

2080
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.230
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2081
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 2>when you look into the story,</v>

2082
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2083

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a deep dude.</v>

2086
00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:42.270
<v Speaker 2>It's three parts.</v>

2087
00:55:42.271 --> 00:55:43.104
<v Speaker 2>Paradise lost.</v>

2088
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Do they ever in jail?</v>

2089
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

2090
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:45.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2091
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2092
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:46.801
<v Speaker 2>they knew it.</v>

2093
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:50.280
<v Speaker 2>And when they finally figured out that they didn't do it,</v>

2094
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 2>they decided to say,</v>

2095
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:53.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2096
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.680
<v Speaker 2>that was so much pressure with the supreme court that they did.</v>

2097
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to lose so bad that they said,</v>

2098
00:55:59.101 --> 00:55:59.490
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2099
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.840
<v Speaker 2>we'll let you guys out of prison right now.</v>

2100
00:56:00.841 --> 00:56:02.160
<v Speaker 2>But you got to admit that you did it.</v>

2101
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2102
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:03.361
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2103
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:07.990
<v Speaker 2>So they let them out instead of dragging on and dragging on another coma years.</v>

2104
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:09.331
<v Speaker 2>They let them out.</v>

2105
00:56:09.331 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 2>As long as they admitted that they did it.</v>

2106
00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2107
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2108
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.853
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2109
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So they got them off the hook.</v>

2110
00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And then you let them out.</v>

2111
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 2>They still want.</v>

2112
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:16.763
<v Speaker 2>They got conviction.</v>

2113
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.400
<v Speaker 2>That was the most.</v>

2114
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 2>That was the most important thing.</v>

2115
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.651
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2116

2137
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 4>He's a beast dude.</v>

2138
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 4>He came running and like some sort of a wild animal at him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I barely remember the fight.</v>

2150
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 4>You just saw red.</v>

2151
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.850
<v Speaker 4>He just went into the zone like immediately into the sea.</v>

2152
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:13.180
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I like about dominick specifically is the way he thinks about</v>

2153
00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:13.800
<v Speaker 4>finding and you,</v>

2154
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:13.991
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2155
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you see that when he does the UFC analyst position,</v>

2156
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:20.820
<v Speaker 4>when he starts talking about like especially post-fight breakdowns,</v>

2157
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 4>what guys did wrong and I think he's really,</v>

2158
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 4>really aware of like movement and technique very,</v>

2159
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 4>very on top of the sport,</v>

2160
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2161
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.311
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>

2162
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:30.671
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2163
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Him and DC are probably the two smartest guys I know about the sport as far as</v>

2164
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 4>current fighters in the sport.</v>

2165
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.920
<v Speaker 4>You listen and Dominick Cruz talk like Jesus Christ,</v>

2166
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.550
<v Speaker 4>like he was helping chill up for,</v>

2167
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.430
<v Speaker 4>I forget who is going to fight,</v>

2168
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.410
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2169
00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:46.280
<v Speaker 4>we were working out together and he was discussing these angles and his foot</v>

2170
00:57:46.281 --> 00:57:46.560
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2171
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2172
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

2173
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 4>he's just his phd in footwork.</v>

2174
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2175
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 4>he's a wizard and I think he opened up a lot of guys eyes as to how frustrating</v>

2176
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:55.054
<v Speaker 4>that shit was.</v>

2177
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:55.911
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2178
00:57:55.911 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people,</v>

2179
00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:57.611
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

2180
00:57:57.611 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 4>he's one of those fears,</v>

2181
00:57:58.721 --> 00:57:59.510
<v Speaker 4>these innovators,</v>

2182
00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:00.311
<v Speaker 4>these fighters.</v>

2183
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 4>It'll take like the steps and when they,</v>

2184
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 4>when they take these steps like you see everybody else go,</v>

2185
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.333
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2186
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:07.223
<v Speaker 4>copycat.</v>

2187
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

2188
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2189
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:08.711
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2190
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:09.431
<v Speaker 4>as a sport,</v>

2191
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think the sport is still,</v>

2192
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:11.621
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2193
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:15.190
<v Speaker 4>there's more variables I think in mixed martial arts and there aren't any other</v>

2194
00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 4>combat sport by far,</v>

2195
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:16.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2196
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:21.610
<v Speaker 4>We could easily agree to that and I think that just the unique demands of combat</v>

2197
00:58:21.611 --> 00:58:22.031
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>

2198
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:22.181
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2199
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:25.840
<v Speaker 4>the ability to keep your emotions in check and to deal with getting your bell</v>

2200
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:26.560
<v Speaker 4>rung,</v>

2201
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.230
<v Speaker 4>getting blasted while you're in there and there's those variables.</v>

2202
00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 4>There's so many.</v>

2203
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 4>And then the different ways you can fight the fact that you can take a fight to</v>

2204
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:33.791
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>

2205
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you have to avoid a guy trying to take you to the ground.</v>

2206
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 4>The fact that while you're thinking about the guy trying to take you to the</v>

2207
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:39.990
<v Speaker 4>ground and punch you in the face because you're looking for.</v>

2208
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:43.750
<v Speaker 4>There's so many variables going on that we're not even remotely done with.</v>

2209
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Figuring out what's the best way to do this thing.</v>

2210
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if we ever will.</v>

2211
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we ever think it's constantly evolving into a lot smaller.</v>

2212
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 4>You don't have enough time to master it all.</v>

2213
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:56.080
<v Speaker 4>There's so much to too many techniques in Jujitsu to master.</v>

2214
00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.640
<v Speaker 4>You add the wrestling and then you had the kickboxing and body type and body.</v>

2215
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 4>Certain body logic or your body.</v>

2216
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2217
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Arguably the best.</v>

2218
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2219
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 4>That's the best body for the long strong guys.</v>

2220
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 4>His strikings getting better.</v>

2221
00:59:09.101 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2222
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.383
<v Speaker 4>How'd Gracie?</v>

2223
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.613
<v Speaker 4>It seems like,</v>

2224
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if still fighting,</v>

2225
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:14.190
<v Speaker 4>but the his last fight it.</v>

2226
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 4>He Won.</v>

2227
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.420
<v Speaker 4>And Chad,</v>

2228
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 4>we decide to stop doing mma.</v>

2229
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.541
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>

2230
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:19.691
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2231
00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:20.524
<v Speaker 4>He's focused.</v>

2232
00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2233
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I think he won his last fight and then just said fuck it.</v>

2234
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:24.883
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

2235
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not positive he retired,</v>

2236
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 4>but I know he's doing way more.</v>

2237
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Just seemed like a striking was finally coming together.</v>

2238
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Good footwork and good chap.</v>

2239
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Good Duma.</v>

2240
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.811
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan.</v>

2241
00:59:35.811 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of his Jujitsu too,</v>

2242
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:38.203
<v Speaker 4>but you know who's.</v>

2243
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 4>Who impressed the shit out of me.</v>

2244
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 4>And then Neil magnifiers,</v>

2245
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:42.644
<v Speaker 4>Damien Maia.</v>

2246
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.310
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2247
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

2248
00:59:44.691 --> 00:59:46.370
<v Speaker 4>he's a Boa constrictor.</v>

2249
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:46.821
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2250
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:47.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2251
00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 4>I knew it from the rick story fight.</v>

2252
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 4>I saw in the rick story,</v>

2253
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.730
<v Speaker 4>find them like this is like a next level constrictor,</v>

2254
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2255
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 4>especially when he gets down to one 70,</v>

2256
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 4>he's a big ass one 70 at one 85.</v>

2257
00:59:57.951 --> 00:59:59.270
<v Speaker 4>He was like a good size.</v>

2258
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like undersized,</v>

2259
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 4>but at one 70 you can tell that with his technique and then the strength and</v>

2260
01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:09.880
<v Speaker 4>leverage the long limbs advantage that he's having God right now.</v>

2261
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Super tear,</v>

2262
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:14.030
<v Speaker 4>but it's the way he took the back and then when I talked to him about it</v>

2263
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:14.481
<v Speaker 4>afterwards,</v>

2264
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 4>after the fight and he was talking about the adjustments that he had to make to</v>

2265
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:21.460
<v Speaker 4>get Neil Macanese back and to finish them off because of how he was defending my</v>

2266
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 4>disguise.</v>

2267
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 4>He's on a very,</v>

2268
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 4>very high level,</v>

2269
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.313
<v Speaker 4>high level.</v>

2270
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.473
<v Speaker 4>Thank God.</v>

2271
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.221
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of it.</v>

2272
01:00:27.221 --> 01:00:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Worst matchup for nail.</v>

2273
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Then Neil took that fight against their Silva and then won that fight.</v>

2274
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 4>So back on track to Eric.</v>

2275
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:33.800
<v Speaker 4>So if I was a good fight,</v>

2276
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.320
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

2277
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:34.971
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

2278
01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:36.590
<v Speaker 4>It was weird to see Eric Silva look like that.</v>

2279
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2280
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people had questions about the way he looked physically,</v>

2282
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2283
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:42.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2284
01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 4>this is just something we're going to have to deal with in the middle of this,</v>

2285
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 4>this drug testing environment now,</v>

2286
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.370
<v Speaker 4>like everyone's under suspicion.</v>

2287
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.611
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2288
01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 4>And when you come in and your body looks radically different than it did before</v>

2289
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 4>and immediately people are going to suspect,</v>

2290
01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 4>don't you think people have the right to suspect?</v>

2291
01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.373
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

2292
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:57.981
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

2293
01:00:57.981 --> 01:00:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Steroids and boxing.</v>

2294
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2295
01:00:59.550 --> 01:00:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

2297
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:01.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2298
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Haven't figured out how to.</v>

2299
01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Boxing has been around for 7,000 years and they haven't figured out how to keep</v>

2300
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:07.100
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2301
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.030
<v Speaker 4>They don't give up together.</v>

2302
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.651
<v Speaker 4>They don't give them me.</v>

2303
01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Tell you something right now.</v>

2304
01:01:09.591 --> 01:01:10.380
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you right now,</v>

2305
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 4>the amount of testing that the UFC fighters go through is above and beyond</v>

2306
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 4>anything you ever see ever in boxing.</v>

2307
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Ever get a floyd mayweather,</v>

2308
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 4>manny Pacquiao type situation where they.</v>

2309
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 4>They agree to water testing,</v>

2310
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.270
<v Speaker 4>but even in that one we found out that floyd took a.</v>

2311
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:28.920
<v Speaker 4>An Ivy.</v>

2312
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2313
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

2314
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.450
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to take an IB.</v>

2315
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 4>That's boxing really under the U.</v>

2316
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.740
<v Speaker 4>S antidoping agency rules because you can use an ivy and the ivy can mask the</v>

2317
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:41.450
<v Speaker 4>use of any sort of steroid.</v>

2318
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.220
<v Speaker 4>You're on,</v>

2319
01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

2320
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 4>You ever seen the vendor holy field back in the day?</v>

2321
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 4>That was 30 Mr Olympia.</v>

2322
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:48.560
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking Jack.</v>

2323
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:48.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2324
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:50.650
<v Speaker 4>when he went up from positive,</v>

2325
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.630
<v Speaker 4>you think that's positive,</v>

2326
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:52.840
<v Speaker 4>but he got linked to a,</v>

2327
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2328
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 4>a steroid clinic under the name like Boli.</v>

2329
01:01:56.901 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 4>Holyfield Tyson.</v>

2330
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.140
<v Speaker 4>He got fucked.</v>

2331
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.861
<v Speaker 4>What about Tyson?</v>

2332
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

2333
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:04.340
<v Speaker 4>What do I think if I had to bet my entire life savings on it?</v>

2334
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.690
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>

2335
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:06.740
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know for sure.</v>

2336
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

2337
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 4>I know professional sports.</v>

2338
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.291
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what though,</v>

2339
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:09.501
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2340
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:10.910
<v Speaker 4>When Tyson came out of jail,</v>

2341
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.340
<v Speaker 4>remember when we saw Jack Tyson damage?</v>

2342
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I could just crack George,</v>

2343
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 4>but two big shots.</v>

2344
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 4>You remember Jack Tyson?</v>

2345
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Tyson fault.</v>

2346
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Was it Kevin Ferguson?</v>

2347
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Was that his first opponent right out of jail.</v>

2348
01:02:20.651 --> 01:02:22.120
<v Speaker 4>Is that was his name Kevin something.</v>

2349
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Ferguson.</v>

2350
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2351
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.391
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>

2352
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:24.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2353
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2354
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.991
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2355
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong because there was an Irish guy,</v>

2356
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Tony Ferguson.</v>

2357
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.231
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2358
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:28.460
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2359
01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 4>It was the Irish guy that he fought the first time out of jail.</v>

2360
01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 4>I want to say Jacob.</v>

2361
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.203
<v Speaker 4>Brian's right.</v>

2362
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Leader mcneely.</v>

2363
01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2364
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.201
<v Speaker 4>Jacob.</v>

2365
01:02:36.201 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Brian is the guy fought in the UFC.</v>

2366
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:37.921
<v Speaker 4>What am I talking?</v>

2367
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 4>Too Much?</v>

2368
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:38.791
<v Speaker 4>Light.</v>

2369
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Heavyweight.</v>

2370
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.983
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Peter Mcnealy.</v>

2373
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 4>When when Tyson fought Peter mcneely,</v>

2374
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 4>diversity.</v>

2375
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 4>What he looked like from that fight.</v>

2376
01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.151
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

2377
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 4>pull up a picture of Mike Tyson versus Peter Mcneil like fresh out of prison.</v>

2378
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 4>He looked like a bodybuilder.</v>

2379
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Look like a bodybuilder that fight radical.</v>

2380
01:02:52.671 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Six pack fucking super buff.</v>

2381
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 4>So he was getting good nutrition in jail.</v>

2382
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.900
<v Speaker 4>It everyone gets swollen in jail for fucking three square meals a day.</v>

2383
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 4>Terrible food they give you apparently</v>

2384
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.960
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck would sign up for that fight?</v>

2385
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.970
<v Speaker 4>Tyson fighting Jon Jones out of,</v>

2386
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.080
<v Speaker 4>out of jail or prison.</v>

2387
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:12.943
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy that.</v>

2388
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 4>I know it's going to be a mother fucker will also the amount of people that were</v>

2389
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to that because they felt like Mike Tyson got railroaded.</v>

2390
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:21.621
<v Speaker 4>Like that was a,</v>

2391
01:03:21.621 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2392
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 4>that was a questionable decision.</v>

2393
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Like what had happened to him and the lawyers sort of strategy for dealing with</v>

2394
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>

2395
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Was that the girls should have known,</v>

2396
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 4>she should have known going into a room that she should have known,</v>

2397
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 4>but also she should have known because of the guy that Mike is like,</v>

2398
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 4>their strategy was to like make it look like he was just a bad guy.</v>

2399
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.041
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2400
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.050
<v Speaker 4>you should know he's out there at Merck and dudes,</v>

2401
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2402
01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 4>go watch them harvest fraser fight and expect to.</v>

2403
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:50.700
<v Speaker 4>What do you think's gonna happen when you get alone with that,</v>

2404
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.880
<v Speaker 2>that big old room.</v>

2405
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 2>And that was essentially their strategy,</v>

2406
01:03:57.841 --> 01:04:01.750
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer strategy and that shit just didn't work this.</v>

2407
01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.620
<v Speaker 4>But the girl had a.</v>

2408
01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.660
<v Speaker 4>apparently allegedly she had a false rape accusation already before the Tyson's.</v>

2409
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.073
<v Speaker 4>What's her thing?</v>

2410
01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.490
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't,</v>

2411
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2412

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:17.970

2415
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.970

2416
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>

2417
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.950
<v Speaker 2>If Joey Diaz was Mike Tyson's lawyer,</v>

2418
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.060
<v Speaker 2>what would that sound like?</v>

<v Speaker 2>lobster.</v>

2435
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee my bike Chris,</v>

2436
01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:09.943
<v Speaker 2>because you're my friend.</v>

2437
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:12.583
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2438
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:15.170
<v Speaker 4>So she claimed he just straight raped her.</v>

2439
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2440
01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the exact was,</v>

2441
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:19.690
<v Speaker 4>but there was like,</v>

2442
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:22.740
<v Speaker 4>I really shouldn't be saying even saying what the evidence looks at.</v>

2443
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.583
<v Speaker 4>Barely remember.</v>

2444
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.440
<v Speaker 4>But there was something to the ics,</v>

2445
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 4>something similar to,</v>

2446
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.200
<v Speaker 4>she had come up to the room.</v>

2447
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 4>She had taken off her panties shield in the bathroom and like they were saying</v>

2448
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:33.341
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2449
01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 4>that says that she was getting ready for sex,</v>

2450
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 4>which doesn't necessarily mean that could mean it was she needed anymore.</v>

2451
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:39.221
<v Speaker 4>It was funky.</v>

2452
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 4>She took a leak.</v>

2453
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to take it out of her vagina.</v>

2454
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:42.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what the garbage is for,</v>

2455
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2456
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2457
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't have one of those.</v>

2458
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2459
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:45.701
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either,</v>

2460
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:46.534
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2461
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 4>but so far there was no,</v>

2462
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there was anything,</v>

2463
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2464
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.200
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2465
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2466
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.493
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2467
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.873
<v Speaker 4>could have A.</v>

2468
01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything that could have been done while while it was</v>

2469
01:05:59.421 --> 01:06:00.350
<v Speaker 4>going on too,</v>

2470
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.703
<v Speaker 4>to make it.</v>

2471
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 4>If you're not there,</v>

2472
01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:04.480
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2473
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.201
<v Speaker 4>To make it accurate.</v>

2474
01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 4>If you're not there,</v>

2475
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:06.401
<v Speaker 4>if you're.</v>

2476
01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 4>If you're not the woman or you're not the man.</v>

2477
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 4>When you were describing something that happens when someone's alleging that</v>

2478
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:12.904
<v Speaker 4>someone raped you,</v>

2479
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.920
<v Speaker 4>you Kinda fucked when you're Mike Tyson,</v>

2480
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 4>you accused you of rape because I can see it.</v>

2481
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:17.974
<v Speaker 4>But did he do it?</v>

2482
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>

2483
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either and I think that whenever he did the court said he did and</v>

2484
01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:23.254
<v Speaker 4>they put them away.</v>

2485
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 4>He still says he didn't know and I think like,</v>

2486
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2487
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:27.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2488
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:28.063
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2489
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2490
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.440
<v Speaker 4>when you find out that someone had already gotten off of a false rape</v>

2491
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:35.284
<v Speaker 4>accusation,</v>

2492
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't get raped still.</v>

2493
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.933
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2494
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 4>It could be crazy,</v>

2495
01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.660
<v Speaker 4>but it would be like crazy cry wolf,</v>

2496
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2497
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 4>Bitches to be crazy.</v>

2498
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:48.860
<v Speaker 4>But who knows what the original circumstance was and she was really young,</v>

2499
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:49.723

<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

2502
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she was dating some other animal or something,</v>

2503
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:53.771
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Funny because</v>

2630
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 3>for the last couple of days I've been really into what's going on youtube and</v>

2631
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:16.250
<v Speaker 3>just watching a intelligent octopus documentaries and where they test their</v>

2632
01:10:16.251 --> 01:10:17.030
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

2633
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that off the coast of Washington they have a problem with.</v>

2634
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 3>There are certain areas that they have a problem with in the water where octopus</v>

2635
01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 3>attack you and they got it on film,</v>

2636
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:31.200
<v Speaker 3>like attacking these divers and octopus man.</v>

2637
01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:32.063
<v Speaker 3>You heard of this?</v>

2638
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2639
01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 3>they're predatory you.</v>

2640
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the video of the meeting sharks?</v>

2641
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.020
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2642
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.261
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

2643
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:41.261
<v Speaker 3>Like a giant squid who up the video of octopus kills a shark because there was a</v>

2644
01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:46.751
<v Speaker 3>problem that they had with this aquarium where these sharks were dying and they</v>

2645
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 3>thought that like someone was stealing the sharks or they thought that maybe</v>

2646
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:53.870
<v Speaker 3>like one of the other sharks was killing the sharks.</v>

2647
01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:55.340
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't figure out what the fuck was going on.</v>

2648
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:59.680
<v Speaker 3>So they set up a camera and in the hidden camera they found out that octopuses</v>

2649
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 3>are gangster as fuck.</v>

2650
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:02.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:03.150
<v Speaker 3>They're so smart.</v>

2652
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:08.260
<v Speaker 3>They hide in these rocks and they pretend to be the color of the rock that could</v>

2653
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 3>change their color to look to look like their background.</v>

2654
01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Like they camouflage themselves and while there's sharks</v>

2655
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.160
<v Speaker 4>swimming by the octopus just fucking explodes out and grabs him and eat him</v>

2656
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:20.710
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>

2657
01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those bullshit sharks so.</v>

2658
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:22.831
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2659
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a small shark,</v>

2660
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's just when you put these motherfuckers in captivity,</v>

2661
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 4>the sharks don't give a shit as long as they have food,</v>

2662
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of dumb.</v>

2663
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.300
<v Speaker 4>But octopuses are not dumb.</v>

2664
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Octopus are smart.</v>

2665
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2666
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.380
<v Speaker 4>I love a good Octopi.</v>

2667
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Occupy might be one of my favorite animals that actually captured on film.</v>

2668
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2669
01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2670
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:41.761
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>

2671
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:42.421
<v Speaker 4>He's about to Merck.</v>

2672
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:43.370
<v Speaker 4>This fucking shit.</v>

2673
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Once they knew that the.</v>

2674
01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 4>The footage ain't that good.</v>

2675
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.970
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad dude.</v>

2676
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Once they knew that the octopus was doing this,</v>

2677
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 4>they set up all sorts of cameras.</v>

2678
01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:53.380
<v Speaker 4>You see how they edited the Shit?</v>

2679
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.260
<v Speaker 4>The edited.</v>

2680
01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:54.751
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

2681
01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:55.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is.</v>

2682
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 4>That was probably taken three weeks.</v>

2683
01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 4>We got to edit it.</v>

2684
01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2685
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I think both both scenes are probably bullshit stuff like all this stuff.</v>

2686
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 4>This is like we gotta build the story,</v>

2687
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 4>knows a little bit too much about the business.</v>

2688
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.560
<v Speaker 4>You know too much about the time I watch the discovery channel.</v>

2689
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.830
<v Speaker 4>How did they get the cameras?</v>

2690
01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:14.470
<v Speaker 4>All over the.</v>

2691
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 4>The weaving a story.</v>

2692
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.580
<v Speaker 4>How many cameras did get the camera in the water like that?</v>

2693
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo can't watch a fucking superhero movie.</v>

2694
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:22.231
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2698
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2699
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:26.011
<v Speaker 4>why would you watch it?</v>

2700
01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 4>If you know what's going to happen at the end,</v>

2701
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:28.070
<v Speaker 4>why would you watch it?</v>

2702
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

2703
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.453
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's going to lose?</v>

2704
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Did you think he was going to die at the end?</v>

2705
01:12:30.991 --> 01:12:31.321
<v Speaker 4>Was over?</v>

<v Speaker 4>They just squeeze the life out.</v>

2721
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Jack will their tentacles,</v>

2722
01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:51.900
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2723
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.733
<v Speaker 4>They're tending.</v>

2724
01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Their tentacles are not just strong as fuck,</v>

2725
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.410
<v Speaker 4>but those suction cups have prongs.</v>

2726
01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Speaker 4>They reach out and cleaning and rip things apart.</v>

2727
01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not a simple as like,</v>

2728
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:05.310
<v Speaker 4>those are just like soft suctions,</v>

2729
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

2730
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 4>don't really have a hook in their mouth.</v>

2731
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:11.760
<v Speaker 4>And if they lose a leg,</v>

2732
01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 4>the leg just grows right back.</v>

2733
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Show gangster.</v>

2734
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 4>And they have eyeballs that are there.</v>

2735
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.750
<v Speaker 4>They are really effective,</v>

2736
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 4>but there is so different than ours.</v>

2737
01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like a completely different branch of the evolutionary chain that,</v>

2738
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:27.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean got a bitch,</v>

2739
01:13:27.261 --> 01:13:27.530
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2740
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 4>No Shark.</v>

2741
01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:28.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2742
01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy is when they're born and from day one they're on their own.</v>

2743
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 4>So that's why they're so skittish and they hide all the time,</v>

2744
01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:39.120
<v Speaker 4>but if you raise octopus in an environment where they don't have anything to</v>

2745
01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>

2746
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.790
<v Speaker 4>they go right up to you.</v>

2747
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 4>When there's these octopus and these cove,</v>

2748
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching all these documentaries,</v>

2749
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 4>there's this octopus and it's coded where they're not afraid at all.</v>

2750
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:48.541
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>

2751
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.351
<v Speaker 4>you go into the water,</v>

2752
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 4>they come right up to you and look you right in the fucking eye.</v>

2753
01:13:51.871 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 4>They go right up to you and swim around and check you out.</v>

2754
01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:55.320
<v Speaker 4>They're not scared to shit.</v>

2755
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.300
<v Speaker 4>But in the wild since you know,</v>

2756
01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:57.991
<v Speaker 4>since day one,</v>

2757
01:13:57.991 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 4>they're by themselves.</v>

2758
01:13:58.861 --> 01:13:59.070
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

2759
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Their mothers don't raise them.</v>

2760
01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 4>They're just skittish and they're just hiding and shit all the time.</v>

2761
01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2762
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I think when they come in contact with people to,</v>

2763
01:14:04.621 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 4>if they have any sort of means of communication,</v>

2764
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 4>they would let them know that people are dangerous.</v>

2765
01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 4>What they are really smart.</v>

2766
01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:14.860
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know how smart octopus are,</v>

2767
01:14:14.861 --> 01:14:15.694
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2768
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:16.451
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2769
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2770
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much information they can transfer.</v>

2771
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 2>There's all these videos of them doing.</v>

2772
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 2>They learn really,</v>

2773
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:24.964
<v Speaker 2>really quick.</v>

2774
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2775
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>They'll take an octopus,</v>

2776
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>a wild octopus,</v>

2777
01:14:27.431 --> 01:14:32.431
<v Speaker 2>they put it in an aquarium and then they put a crab in some glass container</v>

2778
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:34.660
<v Speaker 2>where they could see the crab and they can't figure out how to fucking get the</v>

2779
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>crap.</v>

2780
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 2>But then they in the next a container that an octopus that knows exactly how to</v>

2781
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 2>get them.</v>

2782
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>So the fucking octopus is watching.</v>

2783
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:47.760
<v Speaker 2>The other one opened shit up and he's right there in the octopuses like all</v>

2784
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.384

2786
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:51.163
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2787
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 2>So then they give them,</v>

2788
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.680
<v Speaker 2>they give,</v>

2789
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.540
<v Speaker 2>they give them another fucking crabbing.</v>

2790

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.480

<v Speaker 2>A diverse head.</v>

2799
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:15.663
<v Speaker 2>Octopus.</v>

2800
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:17.223
<v Speaker 2>Octopus.</v>

2801
01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Scarier than a blanket shot.</v>

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:22.023
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2805
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I would rather be in the water with a shark than a killer.</v>

2806
01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.990
<v Speaker 2>A killer occupies.</v>

2807
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 2>And how big do you know how big would the before you start freaking out?</v>

2808
01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking about us like a giant squid,</v>

2809
01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>like moby Dick Squid.</v>

2810
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to start getting nervous.</v>

2811
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.150
<v Speaker 2>But Hey,</v>

2812
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>

2813
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:41.970
<v Speaker 2>200 pound octopus on mount.</v>

2814
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:42.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2815
01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2816
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:43.463
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2817
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>

2818
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

2819
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Especially in the water,</v>

2820
01:15:46.481 --> 01:15:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't even take that much.</v>

2821
01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:50.730
<v Speaker 2>When you take a 70 pound on that thing</v>

2822
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.310
<v Speaker 2>was on his head low.</v>

2823
01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:54.880
<v Speaker 2>If you get.</v>

2824
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the water.</v>

2825
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:56.921
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2826
01:15:56.921 --> 01:15:57.910
<v Speaker 2>A really big one,</v>

2827
01:15:57.911 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>like a 50 60 pounder could kill you.</v>

2828
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:03.950
<v Speaker 2>It's real possible drag you.</v>

2829
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:05.560
<v Speaker 2>And they could bite your tank.</v>

2830
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.453
<v Speaker 2>They could bite your.</v>

2831
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:07.871
<v Speaker 2>They have beaks,</v>

2832
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:08.650
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2833
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can tear flint not far.</v>

2834
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.793
<v Speaker 2>Not Blast.</v>

2835
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:12.161
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2836
01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:12.994
<v Speaker 2>They're not fast.</v>

2837
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:18.030
<v Speaker 2>But if you got caught up with one of these in a tangle in the water,</v>

2838
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.510
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to swim?</v>

2839
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:20.860
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to swim away?</v>

2840
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Like what if it cuts your cable?</v>

2841
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:24.640
<v Speaker 2>If it's that smart and it cuts your scuba cable,</v>

2842
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>you're a dead man for sure.</v>

2843
01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Unless you can get to a knife,</v>

2844
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 2>stabbing shit onto getting attacked.</v>

2845

2852
01:16:41.871 --> 01:16:42.890
<v Speaker 2>jumped on his mask.</v>

2853
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:45.071

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:49.600
<v Speaker 2>The Camera Guy's not helping Jack Legos.</v>

2858
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.710

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:55.323
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about.</v>

2865
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Once you</v>

2866
01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:04.710
<v Speaker 2>do this isn't a problem in Washington off the coast at octopus that attack.</v>

2867
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:06.660
<v Speaker 2>How many people die a year from mocket?</v>

2868
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 2>This?</v>

2869
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>

2870
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.920
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>

2871
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.880
<v Speaker 2>See The fucking beak.</v>

2872
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about</v>

2873
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:10.611
<v Speaker 3>the movie,</v>

2874
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2875
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Like some bunch of 20 year olds go camping off the coast of Washington.</v>

2876
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:15.561
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2877
01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Rewind that because it's like a thing from the alien,</v>

2878
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>from the movie alien.</v>

2879
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at the tongue.</v>

2880
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:20.691
<v Speaker 3>Comes out,</v>

2881
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:21.170
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

2882
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:21.561
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2883
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:24.100
<v Speaker 3>homeboys on screen crying his eyes out to do.</v>

2884
01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:25.043
<v Speaker 3>They might be,</v>

2885
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>they might be aliens or they might live in the ocean.</v>

2886
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with Joe</v>

2887
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.970
<v Speaker 3>here they are</v>

2888
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>animals from another planet.</v>

2889
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2890
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 3>This guy's getting jacked.</v>

2891
01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just trying to test them,</v>

2892
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.221
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2893
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>they're um,</v>

2894
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.690
<v Speaker 3>they found these fossil remains of what they think was an enormous one.</v>

2895
01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 3>The problem with one of these things die.</v>

2896
01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how big they used to be.</v>

2897
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:51.381
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2898
01:17:51.381 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 3>we know like megalodon existed,</v>

2899
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 3>but we know that basically because of his jaw,</v>

2900
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know what,</v>

2901
01:17:56.871 --> 01:18:01.070
<v Speaker 3>how big their like their beaks were and like there's times they can't find their</v>

2902
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 3>bodies because their body's deteriorate,</v>

2903
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:07.570
<v Speaker 3>but they have fossilized remains of enormous suction cups in like an octopus</v>

2904
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.630
<v Speaker 3>tentacle formation that they think indicates that,</v>

2905
01:18:11.631 --> 01:18:12.070
<v Speaker 3>let the,</v>

2906
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:15.380
<v Speaker 3>those mysteries of the cracking where they would talk about this enormous</v>

2907
01:18:15.381 --> 01:18:19.190
<v Speaker 3>fucking octopus that could take down the ship and the sailors would see them at</v>

2908
01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:21.080
<v Speaker 3>CNB terrifies some scary shit,</v>

2909
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 3>could've been bullshit,</v>

2910
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 3>but they have these fossilized versions now of those tentacles of suction cups</v>

2911
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 3>that are making scientists reconsider and they think there might have been an</v>

2912
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:31.094
<v Speaker 3>enormous one.</v>

2913
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Like they never even saw that giant squid until like a few years ago.</v>

2914
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying the octopus now,</v>

2915
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 3>not scared to dudes are going to train octopus to jerk him off launch.</v>

2916
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:40.874
<v Speaker 3>That's the future.</v>

2917
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.613
<v Speaker 3>No Man.</v>

2918

<v Speaker 3>Eddie</v>

2967
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.810
<v Speaker 4>in competition I think.</v>

2968
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.400
<v Speaker 4>I remember right.</v>

2969
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2970
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:16.350
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was like as a black belt ever,</v>

2971
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:17.370
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it was,</v>

2972
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 4>it was super and prettier.</v>

2973
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 4>We betting on this main event and Co main event what we're betting on the main</v>

2974
01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:23.420
<v Speaker 4>event not to kill me.</v>

2975
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I got Barnett Barnett.</v>

2976
01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2977
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:25.621
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2978
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:26.401
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to win,</v>

2979
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:28.560
<v Speaker 4>but I'll bet you for the sake of it guys,</v>

2980
01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:30.370
<v Speaker 4>don't take it off.</v>

2981
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I think he came his way out of the thing.</v>

2982
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 4>Josh is too expensive to eat that one.</v>

2983
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:36.000
<v Speaker 4>I think guys have figured out Roy.</v>

2984
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:36.601
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2985
01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:37.840
<v Speaker 4>And it shows because he's won one.</v>

2986
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.120
<v Speaker 4>I was last four fights.</v>

2987
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:40.560
<v Speaker 4>He's one in four.</v>

2988
01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 4>Have left five I think.</v>

2992
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:44.911
<v Speaker 4>Tough.</v>

2993
01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Tough guys.</v>

2994
01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2995

2996
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.130

<v Speaker 4>We're going to.</v>

3001
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 4>We're going to minimize that.</v>

3002
01:20:54.781 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get you into the cage.</v>

3003
01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.151
<v Speaker 4>And really,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3005
01:20:57.391 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 4>we talk about Roy being a black belt,</v>

3006
01:20:58.921 --> 01:20:59.521
<v Speaker 4>which he is.</v>

3007
01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 4>Don't even run under Henzel Gracie.</v>

3008
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.250
<v Speaker 4>But Josh Barnett,</v>

3009
01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 4>some motherfucker,</v>

3010
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna get you down,</v>

3011
01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:06.300
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get you down.</v>

3012
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:07.330
<v Speaker 4>You certainly a motherfucker.</v>

3013
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 4>And if you remember Frank Mir,</v>

3014
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:09.151
<v Speaker 4>verse Roy,</v>

3015
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:09.451
<v Speaker 4>Nelson,</v>

3016
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:09.821
<v Speaker 4>matter of frank,</v>

3017
01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm against the cage,</v>

3018
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 4>was taken down kind of whooping his ass when I see that.</v>

3019
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I think Barnett's looking at that footage going right when you going young this</v>

3020
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.220
<v Speaker 4>cage,</v>

3021
01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.630
<v Speaker 4>when I get them down and do work.</v>

3022
01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:18.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3023
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that fight.</v>

3024
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3025
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:21.990
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>

3026
01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.820
<v Speaker 4>because how impressive was Josh?</v>

3027
01:21:23.821 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 4>He gets Frank Mir.</v>

3028
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Super impressive.</v>

3029
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:26.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3030
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.420
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3031
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 4>he made Frank Mir looked like it was towards the end of his career.</v>

3032
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:34.110
<v Speaker 4>And then Frank Mir after that one on this big combat time off.</v>

3033
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3034
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 4>But when you look at that fight,</v>

3035
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:36.800
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3036
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.680
<v Speaker 4>that's a big part of it,</v>

3037
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3038
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:39.330
<v Speaker 4>The time off is a big part of it.</v>

3039
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.830
<v Speaker 4>That's a really important point actually.</v>

3040
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 4>I think Josh Barnett is super crafty man.</v>

3041
01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:45.060
<v Speaker 4>He knows so much.</v>

3042
01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:46.180
<v Speaker 4>He's such a veteran.</v>

3043
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 4>He's such a veteran.</v>

3044
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.420
<v Speaker 4>When we look him in the UFC,</v>

3045
01:21:48.421 --> 01:21:49.460
<v Speaker 4>especially this comeback.</v>

3046
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.311
<v Speaker 4>He's one and one,</v>

3047
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:50.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3048
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.593
<v Speaker 4>He beat mayor,</v>

3049
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 4>which at the time it wasn't like the mayor now,</v>

3050
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 4>but he smashed it smashed and he did it in a pretty ruthless way.</v>

3051
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Charged with that.</v>

3052
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:59.640
<v Speaker 4>Sent him with that knee.</v>

3053
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3054
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.021
<v Speaker 4>Well he also.</v>

3055
01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:01.854
<v Speaker 4>Then he got hurt.</v>

3056
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Then he got murked by Travis Brown did and they took a bunch of time off.</v>

3057
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.410
<v Speaker 4>He got Travis Browne that,</v>

3058
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:11.470
<v Speaker 4>that one technique that travis use on Gonzaga and he used on elbow to elbow with</v>

3059
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 4>with that widespread that he has.</v>

3060
01:22:13.501 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 4>When is,</v>

3061
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 4>that's all we trained.</v>

3062
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.130
<v Speaker 4>That's all we trained with,</v>

3063
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:19.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's fucking takedown defense is so nasty.</v>

3064
01:22:19.051 --> 01:22:20.940
<v Speaker 4>So why so fucking tall?</v>

3065
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.920
<v Speaker 4>That elbow comes fast too.</v>

3066
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3067
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.023
<v Speaker 4>I just think.</v>

3068
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.160
<v Speaker 4>I think Barnett with Roy,</v>

3069
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:27.023
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3070
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 4>I think Steve Bay was the first one.</v>

3071
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Let's just avoid this right hand and go to work and Josh is such smarter fighter</v>

3072
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 4>than all these other guys.</v>

3073
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:34.201
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3074
01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 4>I think it's super interesting,</v>

3075
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 4>but we're also assuming that Roy hasn't figured out that it needs to make some</v>

3076
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>adjustments to too late.</v>

3077
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Brother.</v>

3078
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.793
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>

3079
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:41.540
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

3080
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>

3081
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>

3082
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:44.960
<v Speaker 4>See what I know about Roy's,</v>

3083
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 4>he got good at Jujitsu,</v>

3084
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 4>enough to be a black belt and not enough to be a highly considered black belt,</v>

3085
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:51.970
<v Speaker 4>beat Frank Mir and they're grappling competition like to.</v>

3086
01:22:51.971 --> 01:22:53.490
<v Speaker 4>To get that good at grappling,</v>

3087
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 4>you have to be able to solve problems.</v>

3088
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 4>So if he is really good at this one thing that he already knows,</v>

3089
01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.700
<v Speaker 4>he's really good at knocking people.</v>

3090
01:22:59.701 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Talking about a young guy when he competed and all that.</v>

3091
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3092
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.960
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that he's just as hungry now?</v>

3093
01:23:03.961 --> 01:23:04.341
<v Speaker 4>It's probably.</v>

3094
01:23:04.341 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's ever been before and I never see that</v>

3095
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.390
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

3096
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

3097
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Looking like he's lost his enthusiasm for things.</v>

3098
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>He's always been trying to fight the best guys in the world.</v>

3099
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3100
01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and he's had some spectacular results against high level guys like who the check</v>

3101
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Congo fight when he knocked out check Congo check.</v>

3102
01:23:18.281 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Congo is pretty highly regarded right?</v>

3103
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:20.441
<v Speaker 1>Mitch,</v>

3104
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>when he has been highly regarded.</v>

3105
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:23.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3106
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:24.970
<v Speaker 1>after the Cain Velasquez fight,</v>

3107
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:26.110
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

3108
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.681
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

3109
01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:27.514
<v Speaker 1>That was a while ago.</v>

3110
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It was and he still loves it.</v>

3111
01:23:29.061 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out a pat barry,</v>

3112
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Pat Barry Fletcher.</v>

3113
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.450
<v Speaker 1>You can come back.</v>

3114
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time to stop.</v>

3115
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.473
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

3116
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.513
<v Speaker 1>stopped taking that</v>

3117
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>medicine man,</v>

3118
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Pat Barry Street.</v>

3119
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He gave him his mailbox keys to his apartment.</v>

3120
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Pat,</v>

3121
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3122
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:45.241
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>

3123
01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:45.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3124
01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:46.001
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>

3125
01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but Pat Barry's not a world class guy,</v>

3126
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but at that time Pat Barry had never been knocked out before in Congo.</v>

3127
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Knocked him out with one punch.</v>

3128
01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 1>That's fact.</v>

3129
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That is a fact check.</v>

3130
01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 1>But Pat had not been knocked out before and that sort of started like,</v>

3131
01:23:58.930 --> 01:23:59.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3132
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 1>a series of bad losses that pat had fought tougher guys.</v>

3133
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Pat as a wild dude,</v>

3134
01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 1>he came hard and strong and had him hurt.</v>

3135
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3136
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Was an amazing fat.</v>

3137
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the best of all in Congo.</v>

3138
01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Came back and knocked him out.</v>

3139
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:11.481
<v Speaker 1>So I got,</v>

3140
01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think Congo is pretty highly regarded my opinion in an MC.</v>

3141
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And then after that Roy knocking them out.</v>

3142
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty.</v>

3143
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's the way it happened.</v>

3144
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure roy knocked him out after he had the war with pep.</v>

3145
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:23.743
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

3146
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.633
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

3147
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I just think that,</v>

3148
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3149
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Roy has some stupid power and you never know with a guy like that man,</v>

3150
01:24:31.451 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 1>what a guy has that kind of stupid power.</v>

3151
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 1>If Roy hits you,</v>

3152
01:24:34.661 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 1>if you fuck up,</v>

3153
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>if zig zags over the dude can shut it off.</v>

3154
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 1>But when you get to a certain level and you only have one thing,</v>

3155
01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying royal has one thing,</v>

3156
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but if your right hand the motherfucker and you get to a certain level,</v>

3157
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.850
<v Speaker 1>these pros pros go,</v>

3158
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3159
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 1>not getting caught with that.</v>

3160
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And it showed him because he's one wanting one is fine.</v>

3161
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:53.681
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3162
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:53.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3163
01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 1>it's cute too that he has that look,</v>

3164
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:56.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3165
01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:58.390
<v Speaker 1>with the big bell and he rubs his belt.</v>

3166
01:24:58.391 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 1>He gets on top of the octagon.</v>

3167
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:02.710
<v Speaker 1>But I think the reality is he would move better and fight better if he didn't</v>

3168
01:25:02.711 --> 01:25:03.560
<v Speaker 1>have the hundred percent.</v>

3169
01:25:03.561 --> 01:25:06.760
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how far he's gotten with all that extra body fat.</v>

3170
01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3171
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 1>He's world class 1:55.</v>

3172
01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a stretch.</v>

3173
01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:12.523
<v Speaker 1>That's a good.</v>

3174
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:13.631
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3175
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

3176
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:18.280
<v Speaker 1>How dare you cover of the Ugi right now.</v>

3177
01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:18.671
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

3178
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:19.001
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3179
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:19.601
<v Speaker 1>Front page,</v>

3180
01:25:19.601 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo says Roy Nelson could make</v>

3181
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.370
<v Speaker 1>he got his diet together.</v>

3182
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.313
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

3183
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>fibers are legit to a fight.</v>

3184
01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:29.350
<v Speaker 1>He's a thick dude man.</v>

3185
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.400
<v Speaker 1>But I mean look,</v>

3186
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:34.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe working skinny the fuck out of himself and make one 85.</v>

3187
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 1>But if he did he'd probably be in hell two.</v>

3188
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:36.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3189
01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:37.030
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

3190
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.181
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

3191
01:25:37.181 --> 01:25:37.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3192
01:25:37.301 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 1>five reasonable.</v>

3193
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.831
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3194
01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:40.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you waste,</v>

3195
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.290
<v Speaker 1>what is he way to 50?</v>

3196
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.153
<v Speaker 1>What do you think he weighs?</v>

3197
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3198
01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:43.361
<v Speaker 1>Two 50.</v>

3199
01:25:43.361 --> 01:25:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Five to 50.</v>

3200
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.150
<v Speaker 1>How many pounds overweight do you think is.</v>

3201
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.860
<v Speaker 1>If you look at that big giant belly?</v>

3202
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3203
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3204
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 1>How much is that overweight?</v>

3205
01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what</v>

3206
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.750
<v Speaker 1>used to be 300 pounds and he thought at 300 pounds and then he got down to one</v>

3207
01:25:58.751 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>

3208
01:25:59.200 --> 01:25:59.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3209
01:25:59.531 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 1>But Joe,</v>

3210
01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Joe Riggs was a different thing.</v>

3211
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that tall.</v>

3212
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I think when we first started</v>

3213
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.491
<v Speaker 3>losing weight,</v>

3214
01:26:04.491 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 3>Joe was like really obese.</v>

3215
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a different kind of like lego obese arm.</v>

3216
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Obese.</v>

3217
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Like Roy successful at that successful.</v>

3218
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Well you sold.</v>

3219
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because he's only got it in the belly,</v>

3220
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 3>like his arms aren't fat.</v>

3221
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 3>His arms are like it,</v>

3222
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 3>like a stocky guy on</v>

3223
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:22.510
<v Speaker 3>his bellies.</v>

3224
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 3>This giant belly and muscular like you don't have like the definition of his</v>

3225
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 3>shoulders.</v>

3226
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Look at Mark High Mark.</v>

3227
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hunt carries his body fat like all over the place.</v>

3228
01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.710
<v Speaker 3>He's got his body fat and his arms</v>

3229
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:37.303
<v Speaker 3>and his legs,</v>

3230
01:26:37.530 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 3>but Roy has it mostly in his belly.</v>

3231
01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:39.951
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3232
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:41.030
<v Speaker 3>he has it all on his belly.</v>

3233
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a nutritional expert so I could throw some bro.</v>

3234
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Science takes a bro.</v>

3235
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Science like a motherfucking.</v>

3236
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Someone called dolce immediately.</v>

3237
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 3>We need to find out.</v>

3238
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:52.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>

3239
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:56.500
<v Speaker 3>What makes a guy's gut stick out more like when you see a guy and he has that</v>

3240
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 3>giant belly,</v>

3241
01:26:57.441 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 3>but everything else seemed sort of normal size.</v>

3242
01:26:59.150 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Like what is.</v>

3243
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Is that a diet thing?</v>

3244
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Is that a generic is just as genetics goes to the Sony guys?</v>

3245
01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 3>A giant bellies but the legs are kind of normal.</v>

3246
01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like a girl though.</v>

3247
01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes girls eat and they just have these fat ass is bro.</v>

3248
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3249
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:13.760
<v Speaker 3>and then the arms in the stomach,</v>

3250
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I used to work with this guy and he was a construction guy and it was,</v>

3251
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 3>it was the weirdest,</v>

3252
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 3>the weirdest body of all time.</v>

3253
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

3254
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.550
<v Speaker 3>his legs were normal sized,</v>

3255
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>his arms are normal size,</v>

3256
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:29.110
<v Speaker 3>his face was barely fat and then his chest was fairly normal and then he had</v>

3257
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 3>this crazy fucking belly that didn't make any sense to.</v>

3258
01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 3>You would just look at his belly and go,</v>

3259
01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:36.500
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>

3260
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:37.940
<v Speaker 3>But then I thought about it one day.</v>

3261
01:27:37.941 --> 01:27:38.241
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3262
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:38.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3263
01:27:38.451 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 3>that guy would have to do is get rid of that part of his body.</v>

3264
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 3>And he's like a guy placed on a regular basis hitting the gym,</v>

3265
01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:46.920
<v Speaker 3>taking a spin class.</v>

3266
01:27:46.921 --> 01:27:48.470
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a normal guy.</v>

3267
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:49.251
<v Speaker 3>It's a big if though,</v>

3268
01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:50.084
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's a,</v>

3269
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:53.690
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's a kind of a hormone issue,</v>

3270
01:27:53.691 --> 01:27:54.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3271

<v Speaker 3>because whatever you tell me that I tell someone.</v>

3292
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:30.321
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3293
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:31.154
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3294
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Times I've said that so many times I heard that.</v>

3295
01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.413
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3296
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:37.203
<v Speaker 3>I always do that.</v>

3297
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's a weird thing though,</v>

3298
01:28:40.641 --> 01:28:40.911
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3299
01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:42.680
<v Speaker 3>like people's People's diets.</v>

3300
01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3301
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:47.180
<v Speaker 3>I've been paying attention to my sugar intake lately over the last few weeks,</v>

3302
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:49.230
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

3303
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm shocked at how much sugar is in things that I didn't know.</v>

3304
01:28:51.561 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that low fat milk for the most part has sugar and eight grams son,</v>

3305
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:59.480
<v Speaker 3>they put sugar and low fat milk because otherwise it's just nothing sugar,</v>

3306
01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>low fat sugar or low fat milk rather don't drink it.</v>

3307
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It has no nutritional value.</v>

3308
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 3>None because all the things like vitamin D,</v>

3309
01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:07.200
<v Speaker 3>vitaminK ,</v>

3310
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.033
<v Speaker 3>vitamin E,</v>

3311
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:09.960
<v Speaker 3>they all have to bond a fats.</v>

3312
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:10.900
<v Speaker 3>So like the,</v>

3313
01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:11.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3314
01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:11.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3315
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:12.630
<v Speaker 3>there's no fats in the milk,</v>

3316
01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:14.190
<v Speaker 3>so it's like you're just drinking water.</v>

3317
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.473
<v Speaker 3>Like nonsense.</v>

3318
01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I like milk.</v>

3319
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I like almond milk,</v>

3320
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 3>almond milk and rice milk,</v>

3321
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.891
<v Speaker 3>almond milk.</v>

3322
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:20.251
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3323
01:29:20.251 --> 01:29:21.031
<v Speaker 3>same thing though,</v>

3324
01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>if you read the ingredients,</v>

3325
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:23.950
<v Speaker 3>that shit is all sugar son.</v>

3326
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 3>You can get zero sugar.</v>

3327
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Unsweet sweetened,</v>

3328
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:26.851
<v Speaker 3>unsweetened.</v>

3329
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:27.770
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>

3330
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Zero grams of sugar.</v>

3331
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.160
<v Speaker 3>The most of the stuff you get though has the.</v>

3332
01:29:31.161 --> 01:29:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>

3333
01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 3>The treatments have unsweet no.</v>

3334
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Duncan trussell called me up and he's like,</v>

3335
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I've found the best almond milk and so amazing taste.</v>

3338
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.124
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

3339
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:41.941
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you.</v>

3340
01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

3341
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:44.341
<v Speaker 3>How's it tastes good?</v>

3342
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:44.521
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3343
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:45.301
<v Speaker 3>it's delicious.</v>

3344
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3345
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3346
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.640
<v Speaker 3>did you check to see how much sugar's in it?</v>

3347
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And so we did it on the phone and it was just some stupid amount and it was</v>

3348
01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.680
<v Speaker 3>probably like a little baby glass.</v>

3349
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.970
<v Speaker 3>They know you're not going to have,</v>

3350
01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 3>you know you're not going to have a big glass.</v>

3351
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I know some tastes good.</v>

3352
01:29:57.031 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Has Sugar.</v>

3353
01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.500
<v Speaker 3>That's my biggest problem.</v>

3354
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.390
<v Speaker 3>That's my sugar by worst sweet tooth man.</v>

3355
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I wonder why.</v>

3356
01:30:02.611 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Work out so hard so I can eat like shit.</v>

3357
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you want some mangoes with Chili on them right now?</v>

3358

01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3440
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 3>How bad is bad?</v>

3441
01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker combat or artificial sweeteners.</v>

3442
01:32:09.071 --> 01:32:12.820
<v Speaker 3>When a co a soda companies advertise,</v>

3443
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 3>we use real sugar.</v>

3444
01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Bad is appertain.</v>

3445
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ this point in time,</v>

3446
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:20.560
<v Speaker 3>that's all sugar people want,</v>

3447
01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:21.394
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3448
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm addicted to it bro.</v>

3449
01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dick.</v>

3450
01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They weren't real sugar.</v>

3451
01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.570
<v Speaker 3>People want real sugar now,</v>

3452
01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3453
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.011
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

3454
01:32:26.011 --> 01:32:29.830
<v Speaker 3>They feel like it's too risky to get involved with aspartame.</v>

3455
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:31.090
<v Speaker 3>All of it's bad for you,</v>

3456
01:32:31.091 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3457
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 3>The reality is you're only supposed to get sugar from actual foods like sugar</v>

3458
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:36.784
<v Speaker 3>from fruits,</v>

3459
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>sugar from apples,</v>

3460
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:38.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3461
01:32:38.531 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 3>sugar from things that taste sweet.</v>

3462
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 3>That's how you're supposed to get your sugar.</v>

3463
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Like this creepy way that we've got of like sucking all the sugar out and</v>

3464
01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 3>stockpiling it,</v>

3465
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:50.110
<v Speaker 3>and then injecting it directly into our bloodstream and the foreign of candy</v>

3466
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:51.190
<v Speaker 3>like that is.</v>

3467
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:52.023
<v Speaker 3>That's a drug.</v>

3468
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3469
01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>

3470
01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.593
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

3471
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And it's completely alien to our system.</v>

3472
01:32:58.330 --> 01:32:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I feel great though,</v>

3473
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:00.700
<v Speaker 3>but you know who needs it apparently.</v>

3474
01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:04.070

3475

3476
01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.220
<v Speaker 3>They say people who are real explosive needed for the lights</v>

3477
01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 3>to be explosive.</v>

3478
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.051
<v Speaker 3>Who's that guy?</v>

3479
01:33:14.051 --> 01:33:15.430
<v Speaker 3>That was a body type.</v>

3485
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Ray Mercer.</v>

3486
01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:24.960

<v Speaker 3>Real meathead.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's the biggest of big.</v>

3500
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 3>He's a giant dude.</v>

3501
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Went 10 time world,</v>

3502
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 3>strongest bank context.</v>

3503
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Some shit.</v>

3504
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Super powerful dude.</v>

3505
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.360
<v Speaker 3>And he hits a lot of candy.</v>

3506
01:33:46.361 --> 01:33:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>

3507
01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 3>He's a big part of his training,</v>

3508
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:53.490
<v Speaker 3>but I guess he's just blowing his sugar levels out of his muscles,</v>

3509
01:33:53.491 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 3>so not so much steroids,</v>

3510
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:55.360
<v Speaker 3>so it don't.</v>

3511
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fucking matter.</v>

3512
01:33:56.471 --> 01:33:56.580
<v Speaker 3>What.</v>

3513
01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that number?</v>

3514
01:33:57.611 --> 01:34:02.611
<v Speaker 3>That real buff guy that was the mascot for the killing the cage normally do with</v>

3515
01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.670
<v Speaker 3>a huge bodybuilder.</v>

3516
01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So they would use them for like,</v>

3517
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.780
<v Speaker 3>like in between shots of like fights.</v>

3518
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you explain how crazy that was when I was down when he had a photo</v>

3519
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:15.550
<v Speaker 3>shoot because I had to do like a photo thing because I was a commentator so he</v>

3520
01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:18.100
<v Speaker 3>never got to knock out a bunch of photo shoots and he's sitting there in the</v>

3521
01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:23.101
<v Speaker 3>waiting room with a gigantic bag of skittles killing skittles and asked and he</v>

3522
01:34:24.691 --> 01:34:25.390
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3523
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 3>you got to get the biggest pump.</v>

3524
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 3>You need sugar running through your veins to get the biggest pump.</v>

3525
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3526
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.113
<v Speaker 3>Sugar</v>

3527
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:35.801
<v Speaker 3>skittles.</v>

3528
01:34:35.801 --> 01:34:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Right before the photo shoot,</v>

3529
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Speaker 3>sugar makes the world go round.</v>

3530
01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 3>These dudes that lift that much weight,</v>

3531
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I think they just blow their sugar out of their body.</v>

3532
01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:43.541
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3533
01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:43.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3534
01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 3>their requirements are just so high.</v>

3535
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 3>But how crazy was that king of the cage thing because the whole thing was they</v>

3536
01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:54.781
<v Speaker 3>had these mma fights and then they had this guy that was supposed to be the king</v>

3537
01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 3>of the cage and the guy who supposed to be the king of the cage was</v>

3538
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.510
<v Speaker 2>just an actor or a bodybuilder.</v>

3539
01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:00.610
<v Speaker 2>So did you Jitsu.</v>

3540
01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:01.050
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

3541
01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 2>But he wasn't fighting.</v>

3542
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:03.111
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't the king.</v>

3543
01:35:03.111 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he was the guy that was at the top of the heat.</v>

3544
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:07.490
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that locked the cage before the fights.</v>

3545
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3546
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 2>but how.</v>

3547
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.500
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't his organization.</v>

3548
01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:11.570
<v Speaker 2>He was just the guy that terry and bud hire guys.</v>

3549
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:12.643
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

3550
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3551
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:14.930
<v Speaker 2>what was his boss?</v>

3552
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Ruden owned.</v>

3553
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.851
<v Speaker 2>He was part owner,</v>

3554
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:17.684
<v Speaker 2>right in the first one.</v>

3555
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.220
<v Speaker 2>So the logo was like boss</v>

3556
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:25.520
<v Speaker 2>when boss Rutan bolted from King of the cage.</v>

3557
01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 2>They kept the logo,</v>

3558
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.880
<v Speaker 2>but then they just turned it into a real dude.</v>

3559
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.300
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

3560
01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:32.660
<v Speaker 2>These things are a mother fucker so good.</v>

3561
01:35:32.661 --> 01:35:33.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to eat this entire bag.</v>

3565
01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.560

3566
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:43.461

3583
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3584
01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:14.660

01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 2>It's part of our job.</v>

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:16.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3587
01:36:16.191 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 2>my job especially I'm the commentator for the UFC right now.</v>

3588
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:21.103
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

3589
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:21.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3590
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:23.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you could.</v>

3591
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>You can have all that information about all these fights and fighters and what</v>

3592
01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:28.590
<v Speaker 2>happened in these fights in the second round.</v>

3593
01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:29.453
<v Speaker 2>The third round.</v>

3594
01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Rocketship.</v>

3595
01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Unless you watch them again.</v>

3596
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:32.323
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why</v>

3597
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you watch it some twice.</v>

3598
01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 2>You watch them twice.</v>

3599
01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:38.660
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the fight.</v>

3600
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.000
<v Speaker 2>There's somebody I want too much.</v>

3601
01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:41.834
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3602
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I got to.</v>

3603
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 2>You have no time for shit.</v>

3604
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:46.421
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't sleep,</v>

3605
01:36:46.421 --> 01:36:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder if you haven't watched narcos yet.</v>

3606
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I just remember them.</v>

3607
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:51.044
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3608
01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:52.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing when you're calling fights,</v>

3609
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're calling fights you.</v>

3610
01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:56.780
<v Speaker 2>You remember more.</v>

3611
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3612
01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:58.913
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

3613
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:59.241
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3614
01:36:59.241 --> 01:37:00.100

3615
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:02.860

3616
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:03.591
<v Speaker 2>Extraordinary.</v>

3617
01:37:03.591 --> 01:37:04.424
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3618
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:05.783
<v Speaker 2>You and Brent,</v>

3619

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Are you watching all day?</v>

3621
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:10.020
<v Speaker 2>You wake up and I got to watch it as it</v>

3622
01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:12.260
<v Speaker 2>as it.</v>

3623
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:12.531

3624
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:12.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3625
01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a good memory to be a comic,</v>

3626
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:19.100
<v Speaker 2>to do an hour long set and to do a new hour long set every year or so.</v>

3627
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:20.061
<v Speaker 2>You gotta change it up.</v>

3628
01:37:20.061 --> 01:37:21.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to remember old shit.</v>

3629
01:37:21.861 --> 01:37:22.880
<v Speaker 2>You have to remember new shit.</v>

3630
01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:23.650
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

3631
01:37:23.650 --> 01:37:25.520
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to rememorized things.</v>

3632
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to your super targeted.</v>

3633
01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:30.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3634
01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.580
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with your children farting?</v>

3635
01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Do Laugh at that.</v>

3636
01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you laugh?</v>

3637
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

3638
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.720
<v Speaker 2>The five-year-olds figured out.</v>

3639
01:37:38.721 --> 01:37:39.381
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious though.</v>

3640
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Now you won't stop farting.</v>

3641
01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.000
<v Speaker 2>So my wife gets bummed out and I think it's hilarious.</v>

3642
01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing so there's no cooperation.</v>

3643
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>So the five year old,</v>

3644
01:37:49.461 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 2>the other day she,</v>

3645
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 2>she's in bed reading stories.</v>

3646
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.060
<v Speaker 2>She grabs the back of her knees roles or bumped in there and blast</v>

3647
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 4>went up to the fucking howling.</v>

3648
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.293
<v Speaker 4>I think it's</v>

3649
01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:02.990
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

3650
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolutely funny,</v>

3651
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.610
<v Speaker 4>but she tells them she doesn't think I should necessarily encourage it and she</v>

3652
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 4>said you shouldn't far and I'll say,</v>

3653
01:38:08.911 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3654
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3655
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:10.223
<v Speaker 4>you got to stop farting.</v>

3656
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:12.750
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is in my house,</v>

3657
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 4>like laughter is valued very,</v>

3658
01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:17.131
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

3659
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 4>very heavy in my house.</v>

3660
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:19.970
<v Speaker 4>It's always laughter.</v>

3661
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:24.210
<v Speaker 4>We laugh about everything and we joke around about stuff all the time and we're</v>

3662
01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 4>always like,</v>

3663
01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.481
<v Speaker 4>like if,</v>

3664
01:38:25.481 --> 01:38:26.460
<v Speaker 4>if something goes wrong,</v>

3665
01:38:26.461 --> 01:38:27.420
<v Speaker 4>even if something goes wrong,</v>

3666
01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:29.550
<v Speaker 4>they do something that they shouldn't do.</v>

3667
01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 4>There's always some laughter involved.</v>

3668
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

3669
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.300
<v Speaker 4>So like when,</v>

3670
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.270
<v Speaker 4>when she finds out that she could make us fucking howl laughing,</v>

3671
01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.280
<v Speaker 4>they just start doing stuff.</v>

3672
01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Think it's funny.</v>

3673
01:38:41.890 --> 01:38:42.571
<v Speaker 4>Here's the argument,</v>

3674
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:42.661
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

3675
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 4>don't you want it to be lady like she goes to middle school,</v>

3676
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:45.510
<v Speaker 4>starts ripping fart.</v>

3677
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 4>She got the shitty girl and I wanted to be a nice person and I want him to be</v>

3678
01:38:49.051 --> 01:38:49.500
<v Speaker 4>whoever,</v>

3679
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.820
<v Speaker 4>however she wants to be.</v>

3680
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.110
<v Speaker 4>As long as she interacted with people would be ripping farts in school.</v>

3681
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:55.621
<v Speaker 4>Listen Bro,</v>

3682
01:38:55.621 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 4>do you rip farts in school?</v>

3683
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

3684
01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

3685
01:38:58.681 --> 01:39:00.330
<v Speaker 4>But when you were at your house and someone says,</v>

3686
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3687
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 4>well you can't rip those farts when you're in the teacher's office.</v>

3688
01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3689
01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.800
<v Speaker 4>do all you have to do is teach the kid went a fart and when not to Fart.</v>

3690
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think also teaching them about swearing.</v>

3691
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Like don't keep swearing from them.</v>

3692
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:13.610
<v Speaker 4>Just tell them.</v>

3693
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 4>You will notice when daddy talks to the guy at the Lexus dealership,</v>

3694
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 4>notice how daddy doesn't use the word because you can't say,</v>

3695
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.810
<v Speaker 4>come to the Lexus guy.</v>

3696
01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:22.771
<v Speaker 4>You know you gotta.</v>

3697
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 4>You gotta know when to be appropriate and when not to be appropriate but don't</v>

3698
01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.850
<v Speaker 4>because you don't want them figuring out through other people,</v>

3699
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:30.803
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3700
01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 4>why should you hide anything from your kids if you think that it's okay to use</v>

3701
01:39:35.311 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 4>certain words,</v>

3702
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:37.740
<v Speaker 4>you should use those words in front of kids,</v>

3703
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:42.900
<v Speaker 4>but you should use them when you think they're able to discern when to and when</v>

3704
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 4>not to use them.</v>

3705
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:44.800
<v Speaker 4>So I swear,</v>

3706
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.810
<v Speaker 4>I've very rarely do I accidentally fuck up and swear in front of the kids.</v>

3707
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 4>So you try not to try.</v>

3708
01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:51.150
<v Speaker 4>Not to say,</v>

3709
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 4>but as time goes on I will absolutely start swearing.</v>

3710
01:39:55.501 --> 01:39:55.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3711
01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 4>not yet.</v>

3712
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:56.933
<v Speaker 4>Not yet though.</v>

3713
01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 4>That little ones in every now and then an accident.</v>

3714
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:01.140
<v Speaker 4>No accident,</v>

3715
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:02.070
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes not.</v>

3716
01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:02.701
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

3717
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:03.220
<v Speaker 4>Not on next.</v>

3718
01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:04.480
<v Speaker 4>What kind of swear word we talked to.</v>

3719
01:40:04.481 --> 01:40:06.250
<v Speaker 4>They're like occasional fuck.</v>

3720
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:08.210
<v Speaker 4>And every now and then a shit that's not bad.</v>

3721
01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.800
<v Speaker 4>But even the fuck is cheese because they repeated it yet?</v>

3722
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:11.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3723
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.610
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3724
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:12.900
<v Speaker 4>but the shit one when,</v>

3725
01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.880
<v Speaker 4>when the little one was three.</v>

3726
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:16.380
<v Speaker 4>This was hilarious dude.</v>

3727
01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:16.860
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>

3728
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:17.191
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

3729
01:40:17.191 --> 01:40:18.024
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3730
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.820
<v Speaker 4>we were skiing and uh,</v>

3731
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 4>we put all our stuff in the bag.</v>

3732
01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>We were leaving and she forgot to pack her helmet and I go,</v>

3733
01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:24.890
<v Speaker 4>honey,</v>

3734
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.040
<v Speaker 4>you forgot to put your helmet in there.</v>

3735
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.113
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

3736
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.613
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

3737
01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 4>my wife just bit her hand.</v>

3738
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:33.271
<v Speaker 4>She turned away.</v>

3739
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:34.104
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want to laugh.</v>

3740
01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:37.080
<v Speaker 4>And I went and I turned and looked away.</v>

3741
01:40:37.081 --> 01:40:37.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3742
01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:37.830
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3743
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:39.770
<v Speaker 4>she didn't know how funny it was to her.</v>

3744
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:41.740
<v Speaker 4>It was just a normal shit.</v>

3745
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

3746
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.980
<v Speaker 4>But to hear it three year olds say,</v>

3747
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.660
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3748
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.470
<v Speaker 4>what's weird is around my wife.</v>

3749
01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3750
01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:48.203
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>

3751
01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't laugh,</v>

3752
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.940
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't want to encourage like laughter.</v>

3753
01:40:50.941 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 4>She's trying to teach them to be proper but around me,</v>

3754
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>he knows</v>

3755
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.731
<v Speaker 2>he could fart.</v>

3756
01:40:54.731 --> 01:40:59.731
<v Speaker 2>And I laughing and just me and him have far too far back and forth.</v>

3757
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 2>We're high fiving each other with foster moms around wearing the bathroom and</v>

3758
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>then he farts.</v>

3759
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I got to hold it in and he's looking at me and I got to keep a straight face.</v>

3760
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.401
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3761
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 2>don't throw me under the bus over here.</v>

3762
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.903
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3763
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear it from her.</v>

3764
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>And then she's looking at me knowing that I'm holding it in.</v>

3765
01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 2>He feels so confident around me.</v>

3766
01:41:19.901 --> 01:41:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Like when when daddy's around he could just blow those.</v>

3767
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's a problem that we're having.</v>

3768
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:25.090
<v Speaker 2>We're having a.</v>

3769
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:25.901
<v Speaker 2>that's so funny.</v>

3770
01:41:25.901 --> 01:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>We're having a problem.</v>

3771
01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I think if you can hold them in,</v>

3772
01:41:31.901 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a nice thing to do.</v>

3773
01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.250
<v Speaker 2>It's hard enough holding my farts in.</v>

3774
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:38.560
<v Speaker 2>It's hard enough holding my farts in around my wife.</v>

3775
01:41:38.561 --> 01:41:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I have to hold.</v>

3776
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

3777
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:39.971
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3778
01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fart around her.</v>

3779
01:41:41.021 --> 01:41:41.854
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want me to start,</v>

3780
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to hold my farts in around my son too.</v>

3781
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:48.430
<v Speaker 2>That's like having two wives around my son.</v>

3782
01:41:48.431 --> 01:41:49.111
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get it.</v>

3783
01:41:49.111 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not holding shit and I'm going to blow his fucking ass around.</v>

3784
01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Another headline and the parts around son,</v>

3785
01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 2>it's hard enough for the line.</v>

3786
01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:06.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

3787
01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:06.701
<v Speaker 2>Horror Gucci.</v>

3788
01:42:06.701 --> 01:42:07.534
<v Speaker 2>Just tag.</v>

3789
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 2>This is a great scrap man.</v>

3790
01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 2>We're missing out on all the flights have been crazy.</v>

3791
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

3792
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.930
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about foreign Dr Octopus for</v>

3793
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:18.643
<v Speaker 2>headline.</v>

3794
01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:23.770
<v Speaker 2>And I said before this podcast that this podcast would not be a regular podcast,</v>

3795
01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:24.604
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of is.</v>

3796
01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fight companion podcast.</v>

3797
01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:27.964
<v Speaker 2>That's the big lie.</v>

3798
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Were barely talking about fights people talk shit about,</v>

3799
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't seen each other in a while.</v>

3800
01:42:33.191 --> 01:42:34.024
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>

3801
01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:35.493
<v Speaker 2>Fun</v>

3802
01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.220
<v Speaker 2>People do get mad,</v>

3803
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.610
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to listen for the most part.</v>

3804
01:42:42.611 --> 01:42:43.120
<v Speaker 2>It's all polished.</v>

3805
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Chico caymus looks super good in this fight.</v>

3806
01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.230
<v Speaker 2>As those horror Gucci,</v>

3807
01:42:47.231 --> 01:42:48.940
<v Speaker 2>they're tagging each other out.</v>

3808
01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Harwood,</v>

3809
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 2>she's got that crazy wide stance.</v>

3810
01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Like what time is it over there in Japan right now?</v>

3811
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.903
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

3812
01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 2>11 am started early for viewing pleasure dude.</v>

3813
01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Big right hand there by her Gucci.</v>

3814
01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.190
<v Speaker 2>This eliminate him now Eddie.</v>

3815
01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.421
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3816
01:43:04.421 --> 01:43:05.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably,</v>

3817
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.790
<v Speaker 2>it probably started at like nine or something.</v>

3818
01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.770
<v Speaker 2>If you're in those prelims,</v>

3819
01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 2>you're waking up early.</v>

3820
01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you adjust?</v>

3821
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 2>You must adjust.</v>

3822
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like way in advance.</v>

3823

3825

<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep.</v>

3833
01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I usually wake up already all night.</v>

3834
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.940

<v Speaker 2>I finally broke down and I think he doesn't do that anymore.</v>

3920
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:15.404
<v Speaker 3>This was the big one.</v>

3921
01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Here's a great story though.</v>

3922
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:20.180
<v Speaker 3>He's trained for like three years and that falls on the Olympic team.</v>

3923
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3924
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3925
01:45:21.630 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 3>He's getting ready to all the time,</v>

3926
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3927
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:24.501
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

3928
01:45:24.501 --> 01:45:25.334
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3929
01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.230
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>

3930
01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.661
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the guys.</v>

3931
01:45:28.661 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It was in line for Tyson fury,</v>

3932
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:31.071
<v Speaker 3>Tyson fury.</v>

3933
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 3>They offered him this fight and instead he took the Vladimir Klitschko fight and</v>

3934
01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Vladimir fucked as Catholic now in public now is less bone now.</v>

3935
01:45:39.051 --> 01:45:39.884
<v Speaker 3>He's uh,</v>

3936
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3937
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 3>he shit out of luck,</v>

3938
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:43.070
<v Speaker 3>but I think while they're smart,</v>

3939
01:45:43.190 --> 01:45:43.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3940
01:45:43.521 --> 01:45:45.350
<v Speaker 3>not taking the fight with Klitschko yet,</v>

3941
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:46.141
<v Speaker 3>he's not ready for it.</v>

3942
01:45:46.141 --> 01:45:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3943
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.821
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

3944
01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:47.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3945
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 3>he's getting ready and Klitschko is older unless he's doing drugs,</v>

3946
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:51.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3947
01:45:51.981 --> 01:45:52.551
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

3948
01:45:52.551 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that he is,</v>

3949
01:45:53.571 --> 01:45:54.650
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not saying he isn't.</v>

3950
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3951
01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.600
<v Speaker 3>He's 39 years old.</v>

3952
01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.810
<v Speaker 3>He looks fucking amazing and I just,</v>

3953
01:45:59.930 --> 01:46:00.651
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3954
01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's doing what.</v>

3955
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:03.260
<v Speaker 3>You can't speculate,</v>

3956
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:06.370
<v Speaker 3>but this is the reason for bringing it up though,</v>

3957
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.970
<v Speaker 3>because if he is doing drugs,</v>

3958
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:11.180
<v Speaker 3>he can keep that high level for a much longer time.</v>

3959
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Especially at heavyweight.</v>

3960
01:46:12.201 --> 01:46:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3961
01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.910
<v Speaker 3>If he's not doing drugs,</v>

3962
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.860
<v Speaker 3>you got to wonder how much time he has left.</v>

3963
01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Thirty nine years of age.</v>

3964
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.220
<v Speaker 3>The wheels can fall off at any moment.</v>

3965
01:46:19.221 --> 01:46:20.990
<v Speaker 3>He'll make you guys hundreds of fights.</v>

3966
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:23.890
<v Speaker 3>You have to think about his amateur career and this procreate.</v>

3967
01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I think he's 63 and three or some shit like that.</v>

3968
01:46:27.370 --> 01:46:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3969
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 3>his brother was a competitive kickboxer and I think he was too.</v>

3970
01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he wasn't.</v>

3971
01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.080
<v Speaker 3>It was just kicked.</v>

3972
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:35.510
<v Speaker 3>No kickboxing,</v>

3973
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.201
<v Speaker 3>kill his brother.</v>

3974
01:46:36.201 --> 01:46:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Fought PKA karate style above the waist.</v>

3975
01:46:39.261 --> 01:46:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Kickbox cheese with the crazy long pants on.</v>

3976
01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:43.580
<v Speaker 3>He must have been a motherfucker.</v>

3977
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:44.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3978
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 3>he was a bad motherfucker.</v>

3979
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>He actually got knocked out in kickboxing and like that PKA karate style.</v>

3980
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I forget who he fought.</v>

3981
01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:51.631
<v Speaker 3>He fought.</v>

3982
01:46:51.631 --> 01:46:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Some guy was.</v>

3983
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he got knocked out by a kick look up.</v>

3984
01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Vitali Klitschko gets.</v>

3989
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 3>He was an animal man when he was at his best.</v>

3990
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I watched the Shannon breaks fight the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Him and Shannon breaks.</v>

01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:37.180
<v Speaker 3>People are just figuring out Moitai back then</v>

4152
01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:39.813
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know.</v>

4153
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.521
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know that,</v>

4154
01:50:40.521 --> 01:50:41.111
<v Speaker 3>that no,</v>

4155
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 3>kicking to the legs is just stupid as fuck.</v>

4156
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I took a few guys going over to Thailand.</v>

4157
01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Took like a.</v>

4158
01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:46.661
<v Speaker 3>When Rick,</v>

4159
01:50:46.661 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 3>the Jack Rufus.</v>

4160
01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck did he fight?</v>

4161
01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Fought some real high level Thai guy.</v>

4162
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Had they got hurt real bad and he was laying the ground level as record was not</v>

4163
01:50:56.411 --> 01:50:57.120
<v Speaker 3>impressive at all.</v>

4164
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.953
<v Speaker 3>How the roof is fog.</v>

4165
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4166
01:50:58.271 --> 01:51:00.430
<v Speaker 3>He may have been famous legend and all that,</v>

4167
01:51:00.431 --> 01:51:01.660
<v Speaker 3>but looking at his record,</v>

4168
01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:03.850
<v Speaker 3>he was like 13 and six or something like,</v>

4169
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

4170
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.390
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>

4171
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4172
01:51:05.701 --> 01:51:07.240
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy match.</v>

4173
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:10.090
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the first fights we ever got to see a guy who really knew how to</v>

4174
01:51:10.091 --> 01:51:11.200
<v Speaker 3>throw a leg kicks though.</v>

4175
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Fucked his legs up.</v>

4176
01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:13.180
<v Speaker 3>They fucked his legs up,</v>

4177
01:51:13.210 --> 01:51:14.000
<v Speaker 3>but it was interesting.</v>

4178
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.771
<v Speaker 3>I liked kicks in.</v>

4179
01:51:14.771 --> 01:51:19.090
<v Speaker 3>They had to put him in a stretcher in a stretcher because he couldn't walk and</v>

4180
01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Duke who's getting it gets interviewed after the fight was like,</v>

4181
01:51:22.331 --> 01:51:22.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4182
01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.280
<v Speaker 3>not a lot of skill involved in that.</v>

4183
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know any better because now he's like one of the best Moitai for mma</v>

4184
01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 3>coaches in the country.</v>

4185
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:33.161
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

4186
01:51:33.161 --> 01:51:36.040
<v Speaker 3>He watched that when his brother got his legs kicked.</v>

4187
01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Alec.</v>

4188
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.030
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that.</v>

4189
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.511
<v Speaker 3>No one knew.</v>

4190
01:51:37.511 --> 01:51:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Then when I first,</v>

4191
01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:40.330
<v Speaker 3>when I first saw UFC too,</v>

4192
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I was blown away by horse.</v>

4193
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:45.850
<v Speaker 3>I was doing karate at the time and to me I was thinking this is probably just</v>

4194
01:51:45.851 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 3>primitive as wrestling.</v>

4195
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.800
<v Speaker 3>It looks,</v>

4196
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a real wrestler with fuck him up,</v>

4197
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:54.280
<v Speaker 3>but then I went in and got choked out 37 times and realized,</v>

4198
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:54.881
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

4199
01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:56.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not primitive wrestling.</v>

4200
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 3>It's highly advanced wrestling.</v>

4201
01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I had three big steps in like from going from taekwondo,</v>

4202
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:03.783
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

4203
01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:08.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought that taekwondo was like the best way to fight stand up until I started</v>

4204
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:11.170
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing and I started boxing,</v>

4205
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:14.650
<v Speaker 3>just straight boxing with people to get better kickboxing and then I realized</v>

4206
01:52:14.651 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4207
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:19.570
<v Speaker 3>like my boxing is so far behind these guys and I thought my hands were so much</v>

4208
01:52:19.571 --> 01:52:20.404
<v Speaker 3>better than they were,</v>

4209
01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.390
<v Speaker 3>but at least I have kicks.</v>

4210
01:52:22.391 --> 01:52:24.580
<v Speaker 3>And then I started sparring with this kid,</v>

4211
01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:28.450
<v Speaker 3>this kid named Dana Rosenblatt and went on to be like New England middle weight</v>

4212
01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:29.284
<v Speaker 3>boxing champion.</v>

4213
01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Very good box or slot on Tuesday night fights a bunch.</v>

4214
01:52:31.901 --> 01:52:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4215
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.570
<v Speaker 3>You were boxing with them?</v>

4216
01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:33.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4217
01:52:33.971 --> 01:52:34.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4218
01:52:34.211 --> 01:52:35.680
<v Speaker 3>We did some kickboxing to,</v>

4219
01:52:35.681 --> 01:52:36.880
<v Speaker 3>but we did a lot of only boxing,</v>

4220
01:52:36.881 --> 01:52:39.520
<v Speaker 3>but the point is he had a friend that was fighting in Thailand.</v>

4221
01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:40.960
<v Speaker 3>He had this friend that was crazy.</v>

4222
01:52:40.961 --> 01:52:42.430
<v Speaker 3>It would go over to Thailand and fight,</v>

4223
01:52:42.431 --> 01:52:43.930
<v Speaker 3>fight the ties and he was just,</v>

4224
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.250
<v Speaker 3>he was a real pioneer.</v>

4225
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 3>This dude is like one of</v>

4226
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the first Americans to start going over their training in Thailand and fighting</v>

4227
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:50.100
<v Speaker 1>tyler.</v>

4228
01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 1>We hadn't really heard about it then and so Dana and I were going over some of</v>

4229
01:52:54.021 --> 01:52:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the techniques that we're talking about,</v>

4230
01:52:55.281 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 1>some of it and we were talking about like the elbows and the kicks and we were</v>

4231
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:03.260
<v Speaker 1>practicing some of it and just him hitting me half assed on the leg,</v>

4232
01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:04.430
<v Speaker 1>like not trying to hurt me,</v>

4233
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.720
<v Speaker 1>just him throwing a leg kick and feeling the Shin slamming on my leg.</v>

4234
01:53:08.721 --> 01:53:09.291
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>

4235
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Just thump.</v>

4236
01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

4237
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

4238
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:12.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4239
01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:12.621
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

4240
01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:13.580
<v Speaker 1>like this is all missing.</v>

4241
01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about this.</v>

4242
01:53:14.571 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Like how do I not know about this?</v>

4243
01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Like this is critical.</v>

4244
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

4245
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 1>the clenching and the knees to the body.</v>

4246
01:53:20.661 --> 01:53:22.040
<v Speaker 1>And then the elbows from the clinch.</v>

4247
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:22.671
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4248
01:53:22.671 --> 01:53:23.301
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

4249
01:53:23.301 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 1>like there's a giant hole missing in all of the standup.</v>

4250
01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4251
01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:27.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4252
01:53:27.891 --> 01:53:31.610
<v Speaker 1>it never really took off because of that PKA karate shit.</v>

4253
01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:32.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4254
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 1>the PKA karate Kinda like spoiled people to the idea of a,</v>

4255
01:53:36.171 --> 01:53:37.010
<v Speaker 1>of kickboxing.</v>

4256
01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

4257
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.260
<v Speaker 1>like Dana White said that,</v>

4258
01:53:39.261 --> 01:53:39.921
<v Speaker 1>I think he's right,</v>

4259
01:53:39.921 --> 01:53:40.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4260
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I think like a lot of people in this country that are like in our forties,</v>

4261
01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean we look back on that stuff on TV.</v>

4262
01:53:45.681 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 1>If you don't study martial arts,</v>

4263
01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you think of kickboxing is like bad.</v>

4264
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:49.993
<v Speaker 1>Brad Half-ton,</v>

4265
01:53:50.150 --> 01:53:53.110
<v Speaker 1>like with the shiny red shorts throwing like as many they have to show,</v>

4266
01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.980
<v Speaker 1>like throw like six kicks around.</v>

4267
01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they lose points.</v>

4268
01:53:56.301 --> 01:53:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Remember that say would throw these little flippy kicks and they would get in</v>

4269
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 1>there with some sloppy boxing.</v>

4270
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 1>So it was like flippy kicks and sloppy boxing and nobody wanted to watch it.</v>

4271
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't that good.</v>

4272
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that evolved.</v>

4273
01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Tila Rick roofers came along and a few guys came along that we were like real</v>

4274
01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:09.884
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,</v>

4275
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's never really caught on,</v>

4276
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:12.860
<v Speaker 1>was still has it,</v>

4277
01:54:12.861 --> 01:54:13.071
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4278
01:54:13.071 --> 01:54:13.904
<v Speaker 1>Like kickboxing here,</v>

4279
01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:18.170
<v Speaker 1>which I don't get like k one like glory or even what did,</v>

4280
01:54:18.171 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4281
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.210
<v Speaker 1>what did belt or put on,</v>

4282
01:54:20.250 --> 01:54:22.880
<v Speaker 1>what was that they put on something called dynamite.</v>

4283
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 1>That was part kickboxing and part of MMA.</v>

4284
01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:26.450
<v Speaker 1>But here's,</v>

4285
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:27.380
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think though,</v>

4286
01:54:27.381 --> 01:54:27.681
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4287
01:54:27.681 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I think kickboxing dope and I liked watching it,</v>

4288
01:54:30.651 --> 01:54:31.101
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4289
01:54:31.101 --> 01:54:31.730
<v Speaker 1>what's better?</v>

4290
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Moitai more ties better,</v>

4291
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4292
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:34.361
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

4293
01:54:34.361 --> 01:54:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it's the full fucking arsenal of punching,</v>

4294
01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 1>kicking elbows and knees.</v>

4295
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:39.524
<v Speaker 1>And the clinch.</v>

4296
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:40.431
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

4297
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:40.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4298
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.870
<v Speaker 1>the lion fight.</v>

4299
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:42.910
<v Speaker 1>There was this past weekend.</v>

4300
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed they shit out of it,</v>

4301
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4302
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.740
<v Speaker 1>The first dream killer Delano's.</v>

4303
01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that fucking spinning elbow?</v>

4304
01:54:47.991 --> 01:54:49.540
<v Speaker 1>He knocked that to that with no.</v>

4305
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

4306
01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 1>who was two spinning elbow Kaos like,</v>

4307
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.691
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4308
01:54:53.691 --> 01:54:55.160
<v Speaker 1>elbows are big man.</v>

4309
01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a weapon of boy ty.</v>

4310
01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to take that out.</v>

4311
01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to take elbows out.</v>

4312
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I think if organizations like glory and those guys want to just kick box,</v>

4313
01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 1>let them just kickbox but let do the elbow man.</v>

4314
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Let them throw them away.</v>

4315
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4316
01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're worried about.</v>

4317
01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:15.080
<v Speaker 1>But are those shows</v>

4318
01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:17.420
<v Speaker 1>successful?</v>

4319
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4320
01:55:18.450 --> 01:55:19.400
<v Speaker 1>what's an access?</v>

4321
01:55:19.401 --> 01:55:21.560
<v Speaker 1>TV has a limited exposure.</v>

4322
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:23.720
<v Speaker 1>There's not as many households that have access.</v>

4323
01:55:23.721 --> 01:55:26.210
<v Speaker 1>TV used to be like it does well though,</v>

4324
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Gloria doesn't do that well.</v>

4325
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:30.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do as well as it probably could for whatever reason.</v>

4326
01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 1>People don't know who these fighters are yet.</v>

4327
01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:32.751
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

4328
01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not like something that people have been accustomed to get your site kit,</v>

4329
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:40.550
<v Speaker 1>but watching the fucking the boy tie on access TV.</v>

4330
01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4331
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

4332
01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.260

01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:42.990
<v Speaker 1>And this Guy Joe,</v>

4334
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.590

01:55:43.590 --> 01:55:44.423
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen him.</v>

4336
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five year old Thai guy,</v>

4337
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 1>nasty fucking kicker,</v>

4338
01:55:48.211 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4339
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the nastiest kickers I've ever seen.</v>

4340
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>The dude just throws,</v>

4341
01:55:52.230 --> 01:55:52.561
<v Speaker 1>throws,</v>

4342
01:55:52.561 --> 01:55:55.380
<v Speaker 1>punches to close the distance like his hands are up.</v>

4343
01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Way High,</v>

4344
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:57.960
<v Speaker 1>brutal left kick left,</v>

4345
01:55:57.961 --> 01:55:59.290
<v Speaker 1>kick to the body lift kit.</v>

4346
01:55:59.291 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>This chopping this dude down.</v>

4347
01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 1>And then once he gets close in on he,</v>

4348
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:06.090
<v Speaker 1>he finishes them with actually two elbows to the back of the head.</v>

4349
01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

4350
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:10.170
<v Speaker 1>He blasted him with one elbow and then as the guys going down,</v>

4351
01:56:10.171 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 1>he just fucking Tomahawks the back of his neck.</v>

4352
01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I Wa,</v>

4353
01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4354
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I record the,</v>

4355
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:14.821
<v Speaker 1>those lion fights.</v>

4356
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I watched the first one when I was like two and one.</v>

4357
01:56:17.311 --> 01:56:20.890
<v Speaker 1>We're going to think it was pro debut and they fucking went at it.</v>

4358
01:56:20.970 --> 01:56:22.260
<v Speaker 1>If you've got some Cli,</v>

4359
01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 1>you see Yonson Clive.</v>

4360
01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:24.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4361
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

4362
01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 1>There's the lion fight is getting these guys from Thailand that are super high</v>

4363
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 1>level tie fighters and you're seeing some wild wild fights because of how much</v>

4364
01:56:34.951 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 1>of those guys online flight makes.</v>

4365
01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:36.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4366
01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

4367
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone know?</v>

4368
01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Someone asked me last night and I said,</v>

4369
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:40.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4370
01:56:40.471 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking $500.</v>

4371
01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the the,</v>

4372
01:56:42.781 --> 01:56:43.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4373
01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was making his debut as like maybe a thousand.</v>

4374
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think back to my debut in mma or maybe a thousand dollars.</v>

4375
01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I get paid $800.</v>

4376
01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most under appreciated thing going on right now.</v>

4377
01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Lion fight.</v>

4378
01:56:53.850 --> 01:56:54.683
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

4379
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking fights are super high level entertainment.</v>

4380
01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Super exciting.</v>

4381
01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Super entertaining,</v>

4382
01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 1>wild wild shit.</v>

4383
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:02.190
<v Speaker 1>People getting dropped all my drawing.</v>

4384
01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 1>They're getting knocked the fuck out to just figuring out how to make kickboxing</v>

4385
01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:06.654
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

4386
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:06.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4387
01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 1>it is more tie.</v>

4388
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:08.783
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the.</v>

4389
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a part.</v>

4390
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>The part of the problem with kickboxing is you're,</v>

4391
01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you're able to do this,</v>

4392
01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:15.091
<v Speaker 1>you're able to do that.</v>

4393
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Alistair overeem with gloves that come up real high and you just wait in and</v>

4394
01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:22.080
<v Speaker 1>then they throw kicks and punches to kind of trade.</v>

4395
01:57:22.090 --> 01:57:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4396
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they do and it's look at the highest levels.</v>

4397
01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're watching guys like Nikki whole skin and his mother</v>

4398
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

4399
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fun to watch at the,</v>

4400
01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:32.010
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level,</v>

4401
01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:32.843
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>

4402
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think you should have the other elements.</v>

4403
01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I think if it's a standup fight,</v>

4404
01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 1>those other.</v>

4405
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.510
<v Speaker 1>If you can share a guy across the head.</v>

4406
01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:39.781
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4407
01:57:39.781 --> 01:57:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Can you share a guy across the head?</v>

4408
01:57:41.250 --> 01:57:42.083
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>

4409
01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:42.391
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4410
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:43.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no shin pads.</v>

4411
01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:43.501
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4412
01:57:43.501 --> 01:57:45.570
<v Speaker 1>so why can't you elbow anything triggered why?</v>

4413
01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Why nothing is more dangerous than.</v>

4414
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4415
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:48.660
<v Speaker 1>So what are we doing here?</v>

4416
01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:49.980
<v Speaker 1>What you limiting weapons?</v>

4417
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Why would you limit weapons and stand up?</v>

4418
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.400
<v Speaker 1>If you limit weapons and stand up,</v>

4419
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:55.260
<v Speaker 1>then you get an unrealistic sense of the,</v>

4420
01:57:55.261 --> 01:57:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the development of kickboxing technique,</v>

4421
01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the development of MMA as far as like stand up striking you because like the</v>

4422
01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 1>guys at the highest level,</v>

4423
01:58:02.971 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 1>if you see a guy like Kevin Bras are like one of these like super high level</v>

4424
01:58:07.591 --> 01:58:10.180
<v Speaker 1>kickboxer guys and you see like that,</v>

4425
01:58:10.630 --> 01:58:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that becomes like a standard and then that standard goes into like an 11 or a</v>

4426
01:58:14.251 --> 01:58:15.084
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling.</v>

4427
01:58:15.170 --> 01:58:19.220
<v Speaker 1>He see that high standard of style of kickboxing and that becomes the.</v>

4428
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:22.350
<v Speaker 1>The guys who were fighting in mma aspire to that level.</v>

4429
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

4430
01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like in the higher the level is and kickboxing and the higher the level is going</v>

4431
01:58:25.991 --> 01:58:27.870
<v Speaker 1>to be an mma as well I think.</v>

4432
01:58:27.871 --> 01:58:30.780
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you limit certain techniques that you say,</v>

4433
01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:30.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4434
01:58:30.901 --> 01:58:32.310
<v Speaker 1>they can't throw elbows and they can't throw nice,</v>

4435
01:58:32.311 --> 01:58:33.144
<v Speaker 1>well then the,</v>

4436
01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:38.280
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get a distorted perception of it in mma because in mma you</v>

4437
01:58:38.281 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 1>can do those things.</v>

4438
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So what's shut like what's the reason</v>

4439
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:42.570
<v Speaker 4>for the.</v>

4440
01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:43.260
<v Speaker 4>They got everything.</v>

4441
01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:44.100
<v Speaker 4>This guy was right here.</v>

4442
01:58:44.130 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 4>They would say it's because,</v>

4443
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:46.271
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4444
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

4445
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.411
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>

4446
01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:47.890
<v Speaker 4>One did it.</v>

4447
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:48.721
<v Speaker 4>That's what the Japanese did.</v>

4448
01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:49.090
<v Speaker 4>What did they.</v>

4449
01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:49.741
<v Speaker 4>What did they followed?</v>

4450
01:58:49.741 --> 01:58:49.990
<v Speaker 4>Suit.</v>

4451
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.710
<v Speaker 4>What do they think?</v>

4452
01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4453
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:52.000
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it for a reason.</v>

4454
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.710
<v Speaker 4>The Japanese do shit for a reason.</v>

4455
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I think they think it's more exciting.</v>

4456
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 4>I think the by taking away the clinch,</v>

4457
01:58:58.090 --> 01:58:59.440
<v Speaker 4>you make guys fight more.</v>

4458
01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.670
<v Speaker 4>You know you may not make them.</v>

4459
01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:03.110
<v Speaker 4>They can't clench up as much because if you watch Moitai,</v>

4460
01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:04.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it takes in the clench.</v>

4461
01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:06.570
<v Speaker 4>They throw nasty elbows to the,</v>

4462
01:59:06.590 --> 01:59:07.271
<v Speaker 4>to the body.</v>

4463
01:59:07.271 --> 01:59:08.110
<v Speaker 4>A lot of sweeps.</v>

4464
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.350
<v Speaker 4>They trip each other because Barbara,</v>

4465
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:11.051
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to cut you off,</v>

4466
01:59:11.051 --> 01:59:11.341
<v Speaker 4>do anything.</v>

4467
01:59:11.341 --> 01:59:14.710
<v Speaker 4>It's gives the barbaric to like with the elbows don't know,</v>

4468
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 4>especially with the American.</v>

4469
01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Why have it in MMA made?</v>

4470
01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Then why is it not?</v>

4471
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.340
<v Speaker 4>My may can kick someone in the head.</v>

4472
01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Everything's an MMA.</v>

4473
01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:27.070
<v Speaker 4>The standup wise that's in Moitai everything I'm thinking on the ground while on</v>

4474
01:59:27.071 --> 01:59:28.570
<v Speaker 4>the sit on the ground.</v>

4475
01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.550
<v Speaker 4>There's that one dumb rule.</v>

4476
01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

4477
01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 4>That rule so dumb,</v>

4478
01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:33.040
<v Speaker 4>but that's it.</v>

4479
01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 4>The 1:12 to six elbow rule.</v>

4480
01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:37.240
<v Speaker 4>The rule is ridiculous.</v>

4481
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:40.060
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense if the rule,</v>

4482
01:59:40.061 --> 01:59:40.871
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know what it is,</v>

4483
01:59:40.871 --> 01:59:45.310
<v Speaker 4>you can't go down from like on the clock from 12:00 to 6:00 with an elbow.</v>

4484
01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:46.300
<v Speaker 4>He gets too dangerous.</v>

4485
01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 4>It's only because the people that were in the athletic commission had seen a guy</v>

4486
01:59:49.031 --> 01:59:49.930
<v Speaker 4>break a brick with that.</v>

4487
01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:50.951
<v Speaker 4>I saw that.</v>

4488
01:59:50.951 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4489
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.900
<v Speaker 4>you can't hit someone in the head.</v>

4490
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:54.003
<v Speaker 4>They could die.</v>

4491
01:59:54.490 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4492
01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Twelve to six elbows.</v>

4493
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.820
<v Speaker 4>So you can't even do it to a thigh.</v>

4494
01:59:57.821 --> 01:59:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Which is hilarious.</v>

4495
01:59:58.630 --> 01:59:59.463
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that homewood?</v>

4496
01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.210
<v Speaker 4>That boxer in Australia died.</v>

4497
02:00:01.710 --> 02:00:02.543
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>

4498
02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:03.271
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

4499
02:00:03.271 --> 02:00:05.020
<v Speaker 4>a god,</v>

4500
02:00:05.021 --> 02:00:07.030
<v Speaker 4>he was a whatever.</v>

4501
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:08.590
<v Speaker 4>He had like 30 something fights.</v>

4502
02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.950
<v Speaker 4>He died and he got knocked out.</v>

4503
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:11.973
<v Speaker 4>Didn't wake up.</v>

4504
02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:13.220
<v Speaker 4>They took him to the hospital.</v>

4505
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:14.340
<v Speaker 4>He died in the room.</v>

4506
02:00:14.670 --> 02:00:15.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4507
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:17.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like the one that happened two or three times a year.</v>

4508
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:17.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4509
02:00:17.970 --> 02:00:18.781
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

4510
02:00:18.781 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Speaker 4>It happens every now and then.</v>

4511
02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.430
<v Speaker 4>This was the last one.</v>

4512
02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.330
<v Speaker 4>So in tweet it to me,</v>

4513
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:23.500
<v Speaker 4>I thought they took the t two.</v>

4514
02:00:23.501 --> 02:00:24.221
<v Speaker 4>I thought you looked at it.</v>

4515
02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:25.054
<v Speaker 4>I might have.</v>

4516
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.273
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4517
02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.310
<v Speaker 4>it just happens,</v>

4518
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4519
02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:27.971
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4520
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:29.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of boxing,</v>

4521
02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:30.760
<v Speaker 4>so it's a scary part of boxing.</v>

4522
02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Bobby Ray's ex got this documentary on Gerald McClellan.</v>

4523
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:37.720
<v Speaker 4>He did a little dark on them.</v>

4524
02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy story,</v>

4525
02:00:39.521 --> 02:00:39.731
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4526
02:00:39.731 --> 02:00:40.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4527
02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 4>I saw that fight live,</v>

4528
02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.200
<v Speaker 4>not live TV.</v>

4529
02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Nigel Benn and Gerald McClellan.</v>

4530
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Asher,</v>

4531
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:47.810
<v Speaker 4>that fight,</v>

4532
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:48.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4533
02:00:48.071 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 4>Gerald Mcclellan knows he was awesome.</v>

4534
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4535
02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:54.370
<v Speaker 4>At one point in time he was one of the scariest boxers alive and he was a.</v>

4536
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:56.340
<v Speaker 4>They were thinking that he would be next in line fight.</v>

4537
02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:57.183
<v Speaker 4>Roy Jones,</v>

4538
02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:58.390
<v Speaker 4>they were looking at Roy Johnson.</v>

4539
02:00:58.391 --> 02:01:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Roy Jones was coming up and after he'd beaten James,</v>

4540
02:01:00.341 --> 02:01:05.341
<v Speaker 4>Tony and Gerald Mcclellan was the destroyer just smashing everybody.</v>

4541
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 4>But he used to cut a lot of weight.</v>

4542
02:01:07.211 --> 02:01:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

4543
02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 4>he cut a lot of weight and I'm back in those days.</v>

4544
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I think you had a way in the day of the fight I think you would.</v>

4545
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't know anything about Ivs.</v>

4546
02:01:16.751 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know anything about that shit.</v>

4547
02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.060
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that,</v>

4548
02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:19.320
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4549
02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:19.950
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4550
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:21.040
<v Speaker 4>you your brain man,</v>

4551
02:01:21.041 --> 02:01:22.150
<v Speaker 4>you just do that.</v>

4552
02:01:22.151 --> 02:01:22.251
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4553
02:01:22.251 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Wicki guy was on here and he was saying that they think it might take more than</v>

4554
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:27.340
<v Speaker 4>70 hours to 72 hours,</v>

4555
02:01:27.341 --> 02:01:31.570
<v Speaker 4>72 hours for your brain to completely recover from being dehydrated like that.</v>

4556
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:36.970
<v Speaker 4>And the crazy thing is most of the deaths in boxing or in the lower weight</v>

4557
02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 4>classes,</v>

4558
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 4>they're not in a heavyweight where the guys punched the hardest.</v>

4559
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:43.310
<v Speaker 4>It's in the lower weight classes and they think it's because of dehydration.</v>

4560
02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 4>They think that's a significant factor and a lot of these guys dying and</v>

4561
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:47.684
<v Speaker 4>hemorrhaging,</v>

4562
02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:49.820
<v Speaker 4>getting brain hemorrhages in the ring and dying,</v>

4563
02:01:49.821 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 4>they think dehydration is a significant factor.</v>

4564
02:01:52.191 --> 02:01:53.180
<v Speaker 4>So homeboy died.</v>

4565
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Well Gerald Mcclellan didn't die,</v>

4566
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.770
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

4567
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:56.170
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4568
02:01:56.170 --> 02:01:56.440
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

4569
02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.620
<v Speaker 4>But he was a superstar.</v>

4570
02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.640
<v Speaker 4>He was a superstar.</v>

4571
02:01:58.641 --> 02:01:59.510
<v Speaker 4>He was a world champion.</v>

4572
02:01:59.511 --> 02:02:00.850
<v Speaker 4>He was on the rise and he,</v>

4573
02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 4>he hurt Nigel Benn bad knock them through the ropes.</v>

4574
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 4>But Nigel Benn was a bad motherfucker.</v>

4575
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:08.600
<v Speaker 4>Been thought with an Afro Sheen.</v>

4576
02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4577
02:02:09.010 --> 02:02:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Well you had dreadlocks.</v>

4578
02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 4>He crazy dreadlocks and Nigel bank got back in that ring and it was fucking</v>

4579
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:14.864
<v Speaker 4>slinging.</v>

4580
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.621
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

4581
02:02:15.621 --> 02:02:15.921
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4582
02:02:15.921 --> 02:02:19.550
<v Speaker 4>they clashed heads and Gerald Mcclellan went down and um,</v>

4583
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:23.060
<v Speaker 4>I think that was when he went to his corner and he just stopped the fight.</v>

4584
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:24.830
<v Speaker 4>I think it was right after a head clash.</v>

4585
02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:25.780
<v Speaker 4>But I think he had,</v>

4586
02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:27.410
<v Speaker 4>he had been hit a couple times.</v>

4587
02:02:27.650 --> 02:02:28.940
<v Speaker 4>Nigel Bennett tagged him.</v>

4588
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:29.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were,</v>

4589
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 4>they were teen off in each other and then there was a big collision of heads and</v>

4590
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Gerald took a knee,</v>

4591
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:37.310
<v Speaker 4>I think and stay down for the count of Eight.</v>

4592
02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 4>And then I think never got up.</v>

4593
02:02:39.231 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 4>I think sat on a stool and then collapsed.</v>

4594
02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure that's how it went.</v>

4595
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.903
<v Speaker 4>He didn't die,</v>

4596
02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:46.000
<v Speaker 4>but why the fuck would they make a documentary?</v>

4597
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Because he's,</v>

4598
02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.340
<v Speaker 4>he's almost blind from that.</v>

4599
02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:50.720
<v Speaker 4>He's dying.</v>

4600
02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 4>He can't talk.</v>

4601
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:52.783
<v Speaker 4>He barely,</v>

4602
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:56.300
<v Speaker 4>barely remembers anything about his career.</v>

4603
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 4>He's been taken care of by sisters.</v>

4604
02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:04.390
<v Speaker 4>His body's completely atrophied and it's really sad to see you man.</v>

4605
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:06.380
<v Speaker 4>And if you go back before that fight,</v>

4606
02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 4>he was the motherfucker,</v>

4607
02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:08.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4608
02:03:08.451 --> 02:03:11.810
<v Speaker 4>he was like one of those guys like Gennady Golovkin or something like that.</v>

4609
02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:14.180
<v Speaker 4>They'll financially.</v>

4610
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:14.691
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4611
02:03:14.691 --> 02:03:15.231
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>

4612
02:03:15.231 --> 02:03:15.511
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4613
02:03:15.511 --> 02:03:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm obviously a joke joke.</v>

4614
02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.193
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>

4615
02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.653
<v Speaker 4>That's a bummer.</v>

4616
02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.160
<v Speaker 4>I think Roy Jones done some stuff to help,</v>

4617
02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:22.361
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

4618
02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.031
<v Speaker 4>apparently,</v>

4619
02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:23.211
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4620
02:03:23.211 --> 02:03:27.140
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people think that that was what had fucked Roy Jones up earlier in his</v>

4621
02:03:27.141 --> 02:03:28.400
<v Speaker 4>career and made them place safe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can still explode a little.</v>

4720
02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.770
<v Speaker 3>You could explode a little,</v>

4721
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:48.750
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have the confidence to try to get up.</v>

4722
02:05:48.751 --> 02:05:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Now he's going to be worn out.</v>

4723
02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:51.190
<v Speaker 3>He's got this case.</v>

4724
02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 3>It's got half guard and double under hooks,</v>

4725
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:53.701
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4726
02:05:53.701 --> 02:05:56.480
<v Speaker 3>This just doesn't have that to get up and reverse.</v>

4727
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:57.763
<v Speaker 3>Have Garden.</v>

4728
02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:59.310
<v Speaker 3>It is the other side.</v>

4729
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Hang onto that headset.</v>

4730
02:06:01.590 --> 02:06:02.423
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that Funny Eddie?</v>

4731
02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Like he would have to have his head on the right hand side for it to be more</v>

4732
02:06:05.281 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 3>effective on his right hand.</v>

4733
02:06:07.441 --> 02:06:09.360
<v Speaker 3>So he has geico.</v>

4734
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:10.921
<v Speaker 3>Tell you what,</v>

4735
02:06:10.921 --> 02:06:13.210
<v Speaker 3>that's a long flight back home to the US from</v>

4736
02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:16.890
<v Speaker 3>looking nice and attacks with a leg.</v>

4737
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:20.400
<v Speaker 3>That was a very nice mountain scape and this is some good swamp walking by.</v>

4738
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I know you're at home in his Jujitsu,</v>

4739
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:23.101
<v Speaker 3>Jason.</v>

4740
02:06:23.101 --> 02:06:23.491
<v Speaker 3>Mainly.</v>

4741
02:06:23.491 --> 02:06:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Who's a fucking monster legged monster.</v>

4742
02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.271
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4743
02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:27.421
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4744
02:06:27.421 --> 02:06:28.560
<v Speaker 3>that's not bad right there.</v>

4745
02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:29.940
<v Speaker 3>At least not good.</v>

4746
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Attempting to get out of that position.</v>

4747
02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:32.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4748
02:06:32.701 --> 02:06:33.810
<v Speaker 3>at least he got out of the mouth</v>

4749
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and there's hope now was trying to go for the leg again.</v>

4750
02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.370
<v Speaker 3>He's just way,</v>

4751
02:06:39.370 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 3>way Manley's shallow though.</v>

4752
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.240
<v Speaker 3>He has to let go,</v>

4753
02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:46.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to give up his back and going for it and he's.</v>

4754
02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:48.690
<v Speaker 3>He's gone back to it back in his guard again though.</v>

4755
02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:49.180
<v Speaker 3>We'll kick hard.</v>

4756
02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

4757
02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:50.310
<v Speaker 3>He just did.</v>

4758
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:51.570
<v Speaker 3>He didn't play the game right there.</v>

4759
02:06:51.571 --> 02:06:52.270
<v Speaker 3>He just said,</v>

4760
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I just went up and you've already got your smart and he knows how to pass.</v>

4761
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4762
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 3>To mention a good.</v>

4763
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good defense of the past either by your ride.</v>

4764
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:02.490
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have it.</v>

4765
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Turns it around.</v>

4766
02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:08.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

4767
02:07:08.651 --> 02:07:09.484
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

4768
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:11.700
<v Speaker 3>That was Jason Manly Shit,</v>

4769
02:07:11.701 --> 02:07:11.941
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4770
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:12.571
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you this,</v>

4771
02:07:12.571 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Jason man must know because the way he did it from having no fucking control the</v>

4772
02:07:17.131 --> 02:07:17.710
<v Speaker 3>legs at all,</v>

4773
02:07:17.710 --> 02:07:19.290
<v Speaker 3>that's what Jason teaches.</v>

4774
02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:21.720
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that like a classic defence?</v>

4775
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Jason Manley's really good at rolling.</v>

4776
02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:25.013
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

4777
02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:27.000
<v Speaker 3>to cameras,</v>

4778
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the classic,</v>

4779
02:07:28.261 --> 02:07:28.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4780
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:31.950
<v Speaker 3>The overcommitment for the Camorra and then there's a spinning pharcyde arm bar</v>

4781
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:32.813
<v Speaker 3>counter.</v>

4782
02:07:33.010 --> 02:07:34.480
<v Speaker 3>That's so good at St Pierre.</v>

4783
02:07:34.481 --> 02:07:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Matt.</v>

4784
02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:35.440
<v Speaker 3>He right?</v>

4785
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4786
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4787
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:36.470
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

4788
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:37.303
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4789
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:38.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4790
02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.270
<v Speaker 2>he initiated the Camorra.</v>

4791
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:40.293
<v Speaker 2>Uriah Hall.</v>

4792
02:07:41.770 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Thought about spinning it on him,</v>

4793
02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 2>but he spun back on</v>

4794
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:50.160
<v Speaker 2>this back control 45 seconds to go.</v>

4795
02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Not good for you.</v>

4796
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.960
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing on this position,</v>

4797
02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:56.730
<v Speaker 2>if you want to take away his explosiveness is doing it.</v>

4798
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:57.221
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

4799
02:07:57.221 --> 02:08:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how good his defenses from here because gate guard doesn't have there.</v>

4800
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>It goes by the triangle.</v>

4801
02:08:00.971 --> 02:08:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Now wear him out with that for awhile.</v>

4802
02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:03.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4803
02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 2>he's got to get them down again.</v>

4804
02:08:04.961 --> 02:08:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is going to be over.</v>

4805
02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:06.963
<v Speaker 2>He's going to survive.</v>

4806
02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Kenny,</v>

4807
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>take him down again.</v>

4808
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 2>He took them down pretty easily.</v>

4809
02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.540
<v Speaker 2>He's got it.</v>

4810
02:08:13.541 --> 02:08:14.550
<v Speaker 2>He's got it locked in there.</v>

4811
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:15.710
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of</v>

4812
02:08:18.630 --> 02:08:19.463
<v Speaker 2>the other</v>

4813
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.490
<v Speaker 2>second load of the sleep thing.</v>

4814
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to tap me neither.</v>

4815
02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:26.283
<v Speaker 2>I want the skin.</v>

4816
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Once he got it,</v>

4817
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.561
<v Speaker 2>he got to ride.</v>

4818
02:08:28.561 --> 02:08:29.141
<v Speaker 2>Let him break it.</v>

4819
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

4820
02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

4821
02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:31.193
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4822
02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

4823
02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:34.740
<v Speaker 2>How great is a fight when you want to see the you.</v>

4824
02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:35.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4825
02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4826
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:36.183
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4827
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:37.133
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

4828
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:38.041
<v Speaker 2>But that was.</v>

4829
02:08:38.041 --> 02:08:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It came out like a motherfucker slick.</v>

4830
02:08:40.391 --> 02:08:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Written naked man.</v>

4831
02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Very slick.</v>

4832
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

4833
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

4834
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:44.591
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

4835
02:08:44.591 --> 02:08:44.681
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

4836
02:08:44.681 --> 02:08:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it funny that they have this commercial was fucking monster from the swamp.</v>

4837
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>The cracking or something kills these dudes.</v>

4838
02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:53.860
<v Speaker 2>How much different is that than an alligator?</v>

4839
02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>They see those bitches all the time.</v>

4840
02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.141
<v Speaker 2>Alligator.</v>

4841
02:08:56.141 --> 02:08:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Stupid as fuck.</v>

4842
02:08:57.730 --> 02:08:59.420
<v Speaker 2>They see that scary when they're smart.</v>

4843
02:08:59.710 --> 02:09:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing scarier than octopuses.</v>

4844
02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:01.550
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4845
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 2>A B movie right there.</v>

4846
02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:10.060
<v Speaker 2>No street octopus movie that comes out of the water that can come out at night.</v>

4847
02:09:10.241 --> 02:09:11.590
<v Speaker 2>They could stay on for 30 minutes.</v>

4848
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:12.424
<v Speaker 2>I saw some.</v>

4849
02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I saw some gnarliest crocodiles in Costa Rica.</v>

4850
02:09:15.161 --> 02:09:15.994
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

4851
02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:16.780
<v Speaker 2>raining.</v>

4852
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:17.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4853
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:17.801
<v Speaker 2>At the training.</v>

4854
02:09:17.801 --> 02:09:21.240
<v Speaker 2>That giant killer octopus could fucking track you down up the mountains.</v>

4855
02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Can Hide in trees and shit with you.</v>

4856
02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:24.520
<v Speaker 2>About that,</v>

4857
02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:27.550
<v Speaker 2>do you ever see the octopus that climbs out of the fish tank and goes across the</v>

4858
02:09:27.551 --> 02:09:28.031
<v Speaker 2>floor?</v>

4859
02:09:28.031 --> 02:09:30.720
<v Speaker 2>It happens on a million videos on youtube.</v>

4860
02:09:31.190 --> 02:09:32.023
<v Speaker 2>Do you do?</v>

4861
02:09:33.070 --> 02:09:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible how many octopus videos they're on.</v>

4862
02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:36.360
<v Speaker 2>You too,</v>

4863
02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>baby brown too.</v>

4864
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 2>So here's the question.</v>

4865
02:09:39.250 --> 02:09:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first round clear to gay guard,</v>

4866
02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4867
02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Total control.</v>

4868
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>But uriah,</v>

4869
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:45.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4870
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:46.840
<v Speaker 2>can you take him down again?</v>

4871
02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:48.203
<v Speaker 2>Take them down.</v>

4872
02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.200
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be hesitant.</v>

4873
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.590
<v Speaker 2>You know Chael Sonnen took Anderson.</v>

4874
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit son.</v>

4875
02:09:59.220 --> 02:09:59.461
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

4876
02:09:59.461 --> 02:10:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

4877
02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't stop it yet.</v>

4878
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:01.061
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4879
02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:01.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4880
02:10:01.241 --> 02:10:01.580
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4881
02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:04.260
<v Speaker 2>It started with a guard.</v>

4882
02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:06.540
<v Speaker 2>He's getting smashed.</v>

4883
02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:08.113
<v Speaker 2>Stop it now.</v>

4884
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 2>You got to stop it.</v>

4885
02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my</v>

4886
02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:12.903
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

4887
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:14.730
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

4888
02:10:14.730 --> 02:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>this is what I was saying before,</v>

4889
02:10:15.991 --> 02:10:19.980
<v Speaker 2>the fight that this guy has moments where his hand got you in that discussion.</v>

4890
02:10:21.250 --> 02:10:22.620
<v Speaker 2>So extraordinary.</v>

4891
02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:25.590
<v Speaker 2>You were saying like the best things you were.</v>

4892
02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:27.120
<v Speaker 2>You were saying all the right things,</v>

4893
02:10:27.121 --> 02:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile you right in the first round and the first round,</v>

4894
02:10:30.301 --> 02:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you were perfectly right.</v>

4895
02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>He really did what you,</v>

4896
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you would do in the</v>

4897
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.933
<v Speaker 4>first round.</v>

4898
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Anderson's jail son and took Anderson Silva down.</v>

4899
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:41.000
<v Speaker 4>The first reading was all over him and I thought,</v>

4900
02:10:41.001 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4901
02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:41.390
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>

4902
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Can he do that for five rounds?</v>

4903
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:43.161
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4904
02:10:43.161 --> 02:10:43.970
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

4905
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:44.571
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

4906
02:10:44.571 --> 02:10:44.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4907
02:10:44.841 --> 02:10:48.820
<v Speaker 4>could you Ryan Hall have the explosiveness left in that second round of getting</v>

4908
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:50.360
<v Speaker 4>mauled in the first to look at this.</v>

4909
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Kicked to the fucking mom.</v>

4910
02:10:56.250 --> 02:10:57.083
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

4911
02:10:58.580 --> 02:10:59.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4912
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.810
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying about,</v>

4913
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 4>look at that movement with.</v>

4914
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 4>They're probably going to show one more time,</v>

4915
02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:05.690
<v Speaker 4>but look how there's no fat in that movement.</v>

4916
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 4>The way he throws this.</v>

4917
02:11:07.011 --> 02:11:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Watch this look,</v>

4918
02:11:08.550 --> 02:11:09.080
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4919
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.340
<v Speaker 4>you don't see that comment.</v>

4920
02:11:10.341 --> 02:11:11.174
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

4921
02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.760
<v Speaker 4>no give can't train for them.</v>

4922
02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4923
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.910
<v Speaker 4>Well you can.</v>

4924
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:17.580
<v Speaker 4>You can train to never be close doing signings.</v>

4925
02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 4>Tough shit is so good,</v>

4926
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:21.090
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4927
02:11:21.090 --> 02:11:22.040
<v Speaker 4>That'll be a highlight.</v>

4928
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:22.874
<v Speaker 4>Both of those</v>

4929
02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 4>are legit stoppage,</v>

4930
02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:27.021
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4931
02:11:27.021 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 4>This is a legit stoppage.</v>

4932
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.730
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4933
02:11:28.730 --> 02:11:29.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4934
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.430
<v Speaker 4>I know Musashi would probably say it's not fair.</v>

4935
02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:34.521
<v Speaker 4>You got to.</v>

4936
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:38.270
<v Speaker 4>You got to give it to a man by a holy</v>

4937
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:40.620
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

4938
02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

4939
02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.740
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of what I meant.</v>

4940
02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Kind of what I meant when,</v>

4941
02:11:44.471 --> 02:11:46.980
<v Speaker 4>when I'm talking about what he can do in moment,</v>

4942
02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:48.370
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what I'm.</v>

4943
02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4944
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:49.180
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4945
02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:49.500
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

4946
02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 4>if your eye gets off season of confidence from this,</v>

4947
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:52.700
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

4948
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.970
<v Speaker 4>The next guy fights with Brendan.</v>

4949
02:11:55.971 --> 02:11:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

4950
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:59.870
<v Speaker 4>if I'm like Brendan's making all the valid points here,</v>

4951
02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:00.853
<v Speaker 4>but you are right.</v>

4952
02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:01.731
<v Speaker 4>We were both wrong.</v>

4953
02:12:01.731 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile he did threaten off his back in the first round with that arm bar.</v>

4954
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:08.870
<v Speaker 4>So you know that he is working on his Jujitsu.</v>

4955
02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:12.260
<v Speaker 4>He's 100 percent working on his Jujitsu because that was pretty slick.</v>

4956
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:16.670
<v Speaker 4>The way set that up and he caught me off guard was a high level of coach to</v>

4957
02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Jason Bailey is a monster.</v>

4958
02:12:18.110 --> 02:12:20.810
<v Speaker 4>Well I've been around guys like that before.</v>

4959
02:12:20.811 --> 02:12:21.051
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4960
02:12:21.051 --> 02:12:25.580
<v Speaker 4>these guys who could pull off those wild spinning techniques like from the</v>

4961
02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:29.060
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo days and I know like what a high level looks like and his is a super</v>

4962
02:12:29.061 --> 02:12:30.500
<v Speaker 4>high level man and he's,</v>

4963
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:32.660
<v Speaker 4>he's just so physically sharp.</v>

4964
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Like he's so fast.</v>

4965
02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Like once he gets the technique down and he obviously has it down perfect,</v>

4966
02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:38.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4967
02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:41.530
<v Speaker 4>he can pull the trigger faster than almost anybody you're gonna bring into</v>

4968
02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:41.960
<v Speaker 4>interstate.</v>

4969
02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.740
<v Speaker 4>There's really only one knock on your right.</v>

4970
02:12:43.741 --> 02:12:48.741
<v Speaker 4>It's always been his mental state and not a win over Musashi's fucking enormous</v>

4971
02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:52.520
<v Speaker 4>giant and it's just a stoppage when jump spinning,</v>

4972
02:12:52.521 --> 02:12:54.590
<v Speaker 4>especially after coming back for that first round,</v>

4973
02:12:54.591 --> 02:12:54.801
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4974
02:12:54.801 --> 02:12:55.530
<v Speaker 4>got destroyed.</v>

4975
02:12:55.530 --> 02:12:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't go down because of the mess.</v>

4976
02:12:57.370 --> 02:12:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Again.</v>

4977
02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.070
<v Speaker 4>The mental game can come from experience because I remember Gary Goodrich back</v>

4978
02:13:01.071 --> 02:13:02.270
<v Speaker 4>when he first started fighting.</v>

4979
02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:03.740
<v Speaker 4>He tapped his first,</v>

4980
02:13:03.741 --> 02:13:04.790
<v Speaker 4>last or second last.</v>

4981
02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:08.120
<v Speaker 4>He would tap really quick just from the stinging of the punches on the ground.</v>

4982
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.440
<v Speaker 4>People were tapped to the stinging,</v>

4983
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:12.450
<v Speaker 4>but then by the end of his career he was kickboxing.</v>

4984
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:17.470
<v Speaker 4>K One taken full blown and he learned to survive and take those shots.</v>

4985
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4986
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4987
02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:21.250
<v Speaker 4>he did and get,</v>

4988
02:13:21.251 --> 02:13:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4989
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Gary went on to fight some serious fucking contenders in k one.</v>

4990
02:13:25.161 --> 02:13:28.970
<v Speaker 4>He fought some high level guys in k one and an MMA to man.</v>

4991
02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:30.970
<v Speaker 4>Gary fought a lot of crazy fights.</v>

4992
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Can we please see Uriah Hall</v>

4993
02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 1>and Leo Machida next or what?</v>

4994
02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:36.631
<v Speaker 1>Joe Silva.</v>

4995
02:13:36.631 --> 02:13:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Your willpower.</v>

4996
02:13:37.150 --> 02:13:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Uriah hall versus Michael Bisping.</v>

4997
02:13:39.210 --> 02:13:40.043
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

4998
02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Bisping has a fight against whitaker and then Anderson said,</v>

4999
02:13:43.231 --> 02:13:43.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5000
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 1>wants to fight them after that.</v>

5001
02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't see whitaker,</v>

5002
02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:46.530
<v Speaker 1>whitaker in Australia.</v>

5003
02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:48.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5004
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 1>we used to fight at one 71.</v>

5005
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:51.900

5008
02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:55.830
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

5009
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:56.191
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

5010

<v Speaker 1>Weird fight for who's with [inaudible].</v>

5012
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:59.143
<v Speaker 1>Last two.</v>

5013
02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 1>He got stopped by someone who was like a really good striker.</v>

5014
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Who.</v>

5015
02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:04.093
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

5016
02:14:07.610 --> 02:14:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Robert Winter cruise record,</v>

5017
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.741
<v Speaker 1>but that's a.</v>

5018
02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

5019
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:10.591
<v Speaker 1>it's a win.</v>

5020
02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Bids and told me that we're on set and he told me that went.</v>

5021
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That's an instinct fight for you.</v>

5022
02:14:14.210 --> 02:14:14.531
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>

5023
02:14:14.531 --> 02:14:14.891
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

5024
02:14:14.891 --> 02:14:15.420
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

5025
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 1>big fucking wind for Uriah Hall.</v>

5026
02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't get much bigger than that.</v>

5027
02:14:18.601 --> 02:14:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Number six in the world.</v>

5028
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.940
<v Speaker 1>He'll put you right in the top.</v>

5029
02:14:20.941 --> 02:14:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Ten makes Joe Rogan look like he knows what the fuck he's talking about.</v>

5030
02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

5031
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Whitaker lost a ton of Stephen Thompson.</v>

5032
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:28.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy.</v>

5033
02:14:28.290 --> 02:14:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy.</v>

5034
02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy.</v>

5035
02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:30.720
<v Speaker 1>He's another one.</v>

5036
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:31.690
<v Speaker 1>He has this.</v>

5037
02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 1>When when he got more and more comfortable with takedown defense and grappling,</v>

5038
02:14:36.170 --> 02:14:38.610
<v Speaker 1>he spent so much time with Weidman working on his wrestling.</v>

5039
02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to see it in the ellenberger fight.</v>

5040
02:14:40.681 --> 02:14:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You got to see what I'm mother get confident because they don't.</v>

5041
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They're not worried if the fight goes down there and exactly if it does go down</v>

5042
02:14:47.031 --> 02:14:47.864
<v Speaker 1>and I'm all right,</v>

5043
02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.240
<v Speaker 1>well they know that they can defend and I also know when there are,</v>

5044
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:52.500
<v Speaker 1>when they are standing,</v>

5045
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you can't fuck with wonderboy,</v>

5046
02:14:54.391 --> 02:14:54.840
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

5047
02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:55.890
<v Speaker 1>You gotta no one can.</v>

5048
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It's also a different style because like,</v>

5049
02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 1>just like your Ryan Hall,</v>

5050
02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:04.740
<v Speaker 1>your Bio Hall has more of a karate style that he does a Thai style.</v>

5051
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when he throws her leg kicks and stuff,</v>

5052
02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:08.970
<v Speaker 1>when he throws round kicks,</v>

5053
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 1>he throws them like without like the wind up so they land quicker.</v>

5054
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Does not as much.</v>

5055
02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the Thai guys,</v>

5056
02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:18.000
<v Speaker 1>they're doing these steps and everything is coming round.</v>

5057
02:15:18.001 --> 02:15:18.601
<v Speaker 1>They're chopping,</v>

5058
02:15:18.601 --> 02:15:21.210
<v Speaker 1>but everything's coming round your riots throwing shit.</v>

5059
02:15:21.250 --> 02:15:21.611
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5060
02:15:21.611 --> 02:15:22.444
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

5061
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:24.240
<v Speaker 1>If you don't train with a guy like that,</v>

5062
02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't know those,</v>

5063
02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 1>those movements,</v>

5064
02:15:26.791 --> 02:15:27.624
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>

5065
02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:27.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5066
02:15:27.961 --> 02:15:29.490
<v Speaker 1>if I'm standing this close to him,</v>

5067
02:15:29.491 --> 02:15:30.570
<v Speaker 1>he can jump spinning back,</v>

5068
02:15:30.571 --> 02:15:31.381
<v Speaker 1>kick him in the face.</v>

5069
02:15:31.381 --> 02:15:32.121
<v Speaker 1>You're not training with that.</v>

5070
02:15:32.121 --> 02:15:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I can get away from him.</v>

5071
02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Bill machita effect.</v>

5072
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:35.610
<v Speaker 1>When machita first came on and guys were like,</v>

5073
02:15:35.611 --> 02:15:36.360
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

5074
02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.260
<v Speaker 1>He can do more though.</v>

5075
02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Machida never did this,</v>

5076
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't never did that.</v>

5077
02:15:40.230 --> 02:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>He never did that in a fight like a horse kicked machida would throw round kicks</v>

5078
02:15:45.301 --> 02:15:48.720
<v Speaker 1>and knees and punches and he did that jumping front kick to random.</v>

5079
02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying at the time we did that,</v>

5080
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:53.880
<v Speaker 1>people haven't seen it move in and out and guys couldn't get the distance and</v>

5081
02:15:53.881 --> 02:15:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they get knocked out.</v>

5082
02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:55.613
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

5083
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I think gay guy thought he was safe and then the eight a fucking healed of the</v>

5084
02:15:58.891 --> 02:15:59.280
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

5085
02:15:59.280 --> 02:15:59.641
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

5086
02:15:59.641 --> 02:16:00.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

5087
02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5088
02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 1>that kind of speed from that distance and the way he does it with no wind up,</v>

5089
02:16:05.311 --> 02:16:05.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5090
02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a crazy athlete.</v>

5091
02:16:06.810 --> 02:16:08.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no telegraphing it.</v>

5092
02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It's he's a great athlete,</v>

5093
02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:11.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's also intelligent preparation.</v>

5094
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:12.270
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

5095
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Because to train someone to throw those things on a trigger like that with no</v>

5096
02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:17.490
<v Speaker 1>wind up at all,</v>

5097
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:18.541
<v Speaker 1>like that's the.</v>

5098
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:22.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate goal is to have an athlete who's a really good athlete who</v>

5099
02:16:22.141 --> 02:16:26.760
<v Speaker 1>also listens and trains intelligently to the point where there's no wind up.</v>

5100
02:16:26.761 --> 02:16:27.900
<v Speaker 1>He just jumps and kicks.</v>

5101
02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:28.530
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

5102
02:16:28.530 --> 02:16:29.290
<v Speaker 1>What a win.</v>

5103
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking</v>

5104
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:30.873
<v Speaker 4>wind for him.</v>

5105
02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Eddie could have made your money.</v>

5106
02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:33.760
<v Speaker 4>Tiger Schulman guy.</v>

5107
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:34.990
<v Speaker 4>Is that where he started?</v>

5108
02:16:34.991 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5109
02:16:35.710 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Is this amazing?</v>

5110
02:16:37.970 --> 02:16:39.040
<v Speaker 4>And his second degree.</v>

5111
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:39.611
<v Speaker 4>Black Belt,</v>

5112
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5113
02:16:40.210 --> 02:16:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

5114
02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:41.920
<v Speaker 4>You know what's amazing?</v>

5115
02:16:41.921 --> 02:16:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Like Tiger Schulman was like play.</v>

5116
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at Jesus,</v>

5117
02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Don.</v>

5118
02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Just beautiful.</v>

5119
02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 4>And then this nasty.</v>

5120
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 4>I think Musashi might've thought it was a wheel kick.</v>

5121
02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Instead he hit him with that jumped spinning back,</v>

5122
02:16:53.231 --> 02:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>kick to the face.</v>

5123
02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:54.370
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

5124
02:16:54.370 --> 02:16:55.203
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

5125
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh my goodness.</v>

5126
02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.110
<v Speaker 4>That is insane.</v>

5127
02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh my time timing this how people expected you had to fight coming off the</v>

5128
02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:04.804
<v Speaker 4>ultimate fighter.</v>

5129
02:17:04.890 --> 02:17:05.840
<v Speaker 4>He lost that one slide.</v>

5130
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:08.820
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit of let down and he's just doing work and their mindset</v>

5131
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:09.723
<v Speaker 4>Palae.</v>

5132
02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:10.061
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5133
02:17:10.061 --> 02:17:10.841
<v Speaker 4>you know what man,</v>

5134
02:17:10.841 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 4>if a fucking fight went the way the first round went,</v>

5135
02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:14.500
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be saying this.</v>

5136
02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Which is what's amazing.</v>

5137
02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:18.460
<v Speaker 4>You know like you were right and I was right.</v>

5138
02:17:18.510 --> 02:17:19.390
<v Speaker 4>We were both right,</v>

5139
02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 4>but he figured it out.</v>

5140
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:22.323
<v Speaker 4>He figured it out.</v>

5141
02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:23.380
<v Speaker 4>They made adjustments.</v>

5142
02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

5143
02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:25.180
<v Speaker 4>Whoever fights him next.</v>

5144
02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5145
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:28.210
<v Speaker 4>he's going to learn from that first round to that.</v>

5146
02:17:28.211 --> 02:17:29.650
<v Speaker 4>That could happen to him in the grappling.</v>

5147
02:17:29.651 --> 02:17:31.720
<v Speaker 4>She's going to have to concentrate on his grappling even more.</v>

5148
02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:32.860
<v Speaker 4>It's going to have to bring it up to another,</v>

5149
02:17:32.861 --> 02:17:36.810
<v Speaker 4>but he knows he survived and using some dangerous shit mounted.</v>

5150
02:17:37.350 --> 02:17:38.760
<v Speaker 4>He almost control.</v>

5151
02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5152
02:17:39.071 --> 02:17:40.400
<v Speaker 4>how close did he come to tap and dry?</v>

5153
02:17:40.550 --> 02:17:41.770
<v Speaker 4>A rear naked.</v>

5154
02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.240
<v Speaker 4>That was close.</v>

5155
02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:44.073
<v Speaker 4>That was close.</v>

5156
02:17:44.430 --> 02:17:45.263
<v Speaker 4>I think about that.</v>

5157
02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.300
<v Speaker 4>It makes the victory even sweeter.</v>

5158
02:17:47.301 --> 02:17:48.280
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing win.</v>

5159
02:17:48.670 --> 02:17:49.630
<v Speaker 4>How about this fight?</v>

5160
02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:52.060
<v Speaker 4>This is not just DC verse.</v>

5161
02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.400
<v Speaker 4>It's a very interesting thing to enter.</v>

5162
02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:54.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5163
02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:55.390
<v Speaker 4>you wonder what,</v>

5164
02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:58.420
<v Speaker 4>what Gustafson can do on the feet,</v>

5165
02:17:58.480 --> 02:17:58.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5166
02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:00.940
<v Speaker 4>like can he keep dc off of them?</v>

5167
02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:02.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5168
02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5169
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:03.433
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5170
02:18:03.690 --> 02:18:04.690
<v Speaker 4>Can You keep the fight standing?</v>

5171
02:18:04.810 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Does he try to take dc down the way he tried to take John Down.</v>

5172
02:18:07.510 --> 02:18:08.343
<v Speaker 4>Does he try to,</v>

5173
02:18:08.610 --> 02:18:09.200
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

5174
02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.960
<v Speaker 4>to let them know really early on.</v>

5175
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.261
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5176
02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:12.250
<v Speaker 4>I can take you down to.</v>

5177
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Does he try to do what?</v>

5178
02:18:14.350 --> 02:18:16.600
<v Speaker 4>What Jones did take in DC down?</v>

5179
02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:17.530
<v Speaker 4>That's not happening.</v>

5180
02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:18.281
<v Speaker 4>You would say that,</v>

5181
02:18:18.281 --> 02:18:18.990
<v Speaker 4>but right.</v>

5182
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:22.540
<v Speaker 4>You would take Jones down either took him down twice different though.</v>

5183
02:18:22.690 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Well also you got to think it took dc down the,</v>

5184
02:18:25.670 --> 02:18:30.280
<v Speaker 4>but the word was that John did not take the Gustafson fight very seriously and</v>

5185
02:18:30.281 --> 02:18:30.640
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

5186
02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:31.473
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've heard.</v>

5187
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:32.460
<v Speaker 4>That is the.</v>

5188
02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:33.161
<v Speaker 4>That is the world.</v>

5189
02:18:33.161 --> 02:18:34.210
<v Speaker 4>We're not lying about that.</v>

5190
02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not that would have played a factor with Annette Gustafson would've</v>

5191
02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:39.940
<v Speaker 4>have been able to take them down anyway.</v>

5192
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.780
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

5193
02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:43.300
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this fight thinking enough hype,</v>

5194
02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:44.493
<v Speaker 4>getting no hype,</v>

5195
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:45.040
<v Speaker 4>zero hype.</v>

5196
02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I haven't heard anybody talk about it because John Jones is right there.</v>

5197
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:50.110
<v Speaker 4>So elephant in the room.</v>

5198
02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Will John be both of them?</v>

5199
02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:51.641
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

5200
02:18:51.641 --> 02:18:52.031
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

5201
02:18:52.031 --> 02:18:52.960
<v Speaker 4>well there you go.</v>

5202
02:18:52.970 --> 02:18:53.920
<v Speaker 4>And he said he just nailed it.</v>

5203
02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:55.960
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it is.</v>

5204
02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Zero hype.</v>

5205
02:18:57.570 --> 02:19:00.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean John is just so everybody knows.</v>

5206
02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:01.233
<v Speaker 4>He's so good.</v>

5207
02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 4>He's so special.</v>

5208
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's also what's tragic about it.</v>

5209
02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:07.270
<v Speaker 4>You know when a great comeback story though.</v>

5210
02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

5211
02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:08.770
<v Speaker 4>If he could pull it off.</v>

5212
02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:09.633
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

5213
02:19:11.290 --> 02:19:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Josh Barnett,</v>

5214
02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:13.780
<v Speaker 4>them triathlon runner,</v>

5215
02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:15.220
<v Speaker 4>look at their records.</v>

5216
02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Just a ton of fight.</v>

5217
02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.770
<v Speaker 4>Josh Barnett look leaner than I've ever seen him ever.</v>

5218
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:22.240
<v Speaker 4>So the best shape I've ever seen him.</v>

5219
02:19:23.170 --> 02:19:24.003
<v Speaker 4>How much did he weigh?</v>

5220
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:26.103
<v Speaker 4>Good question.</v>

5221
02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:29.520
<v Speaker 4>He still has to be 50 you think forties?</v>

5222
02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:30.320
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

5223
02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:31.220
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad boy.</v>

5224
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:32.083
<v Speaker 4>What's the guests?</v>

5225
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.983
<v Speaker 4>How much Josh Barnett?</v>

5226
02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 4>If he was</v>

5227
02:19:36.550 --> 02:19:37.880
<v Speaker 4>to 40 to 45,</v>

5228
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:39.530
<v Speaker 4>I'll say 48 to 48.</v>

5229
02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Can we find out and say we'll find down here?</v>

5230
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:44.210
<v Speaker 4>40th five.</v>

5231
02:19:44.210 --> 02:19:45.860
<v Speaker 4>It was the same.</v>

5232
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 4>We need the official.</v>

5233
02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Wayne's not the old one.</v>

5234
02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5235
02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.080
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5236
02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.080
<v Speaker 4>the problem is they,</v>

5237
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:51.680
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times when they,</v>

5238
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:53.360
<v Speaker 4>like when I read these things off,</v>

5239
02:19:53.610 --> 02:19:54.443
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5240
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:55.483
<v Speaker 4>at the fights,</v>

5241
02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:56.620
<v Speaker 4>like they have a uh,</v>

5242
02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:57.470
<v Speaker 4>a tale of the tape.</v>

5243
02:19:57.740 --> 02:19:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we go to the video of the wind.</v>

5244
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.823
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be there.</v>

5245
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is for heavyweights,</v>

5246
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:04.250
<v Speaker 4>the only way you uh,</v>

5247
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:06.830
<v Speaker 4>you hear it as if like Bruce buffer sandy correctly.</v>

5248
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:10.700
<v Speaker 4>Thirty nine because like sometimes on my sheet that I'll get like say,</v>

5249
02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:10.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5250
02:20:10.941 --> 02:20:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I get a sheet from the UFC that shows a fighters record and I'll get the weight</v>

5251
02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:16.340
<v Speaker 4>that they use to weigh in other fights.</v>

5252
02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes there'll be heavier or lighter.</v>

5253
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:19.491
<v Speaker 4>So what does it says?</v>

5254
02:20:19.491 --> 02:20:20.180
<v Speaker 4>Two 39.</v>

5255
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:20.511
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

5256
02:20:20.511 --> 02:20:22.040
<v Speaker 4>Nelson to 69.</v>

5257
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:23.143
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

5258
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:26.180
<v Speaker 4>So he was over by four pounds.</v>

5259
02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I forgot he Barnett was 2:39 who said 2:39.</v>

5260
02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:31.551
<v Speaker 4>Powerful Jamie.</v>

5261
02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:32.384
<v Speaker 4>Nailed it.</v>

5262
02:20:32.470 --> 02:20:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5263
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:33.320
<v Speaker 4>hold up.</v>

5264
02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:33.981
<v Speaker 4>He can't be two,</v>

5265
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:34.570
<v Speaker 4>six and a handle.</v>

5266
02:20:34.570 --> 02:20:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise the appellant is right.</v>

5267
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Must have had to either give up 20 percent of his purse or lose the weight.</v>

5268
02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 4>The hold up bro got fatter.</v>

5269
02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:42.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he lost the weight.</v>

5270
02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:44.121
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't be hard,</v>

5271
02:20:44.121 --> 02:20:44.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5272
02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:46.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know Bro.</v>

5273
02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:48.980
<v Speaker 4>He probably was shocked that Uriah Hall flooded.</v>

5274
02:20:48.981 --> 02:20:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I still can't get over this.</v>

5275
02:20:49.911 --> 02:20:50.744
<v Speaker 4>Fucking amazing.</v>

5276

5278
02:20:52.470 --> 02:20:53.310

<v Speaker 4>And I knew guys like that.</v>

5283
02:20:59.301 --> 02:21:02.390
<v Speaker 4>I knew a lot of guys like that from my a taekwondo days.</v>

5284
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:06.230
<v Speaker 4>There was guys that just had this ability to explode with,</v>

5285
02:21:06.231 --> 02:21:06.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5286
02:21:06.490 --> 02:21:09.920
<v Speaker 4>with lightening fast spinning techniques that if you weren't ready for it,</v>

5287
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:11.750

5290
02:21:18.171 --> 02:21:19.004
<v Speaker 4>That's a great fight.</v>

5291
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 4>There was this kid that I said,</v>

5292
02:21:20.721 --> 02:21:21.554
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5293
02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:22.910
<v Speaker 4>his name is Larry Jones.</v>

5294
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:25.700
<v Speaker 4>And his legs went all the way up to his ribs.</v>

5295
02:21:25.970 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 4>His hips like started here.</v>

5296
02:21:27.651 --> 02:21:28.760
<v Speaker 4>He was a tall dude.</v>

5297
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.560
<v Speaker 4>He was like six foot three,</v>

5298
02:21:30.561 --> 02:21:32.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe somewhere around then.</v>

5299
02:21:32.031 --> 02:21:35.210
<v Speaker 4>But his legs were like way longer than he was tired.</v>

5300
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:36.200
<v Speaker 4>He looked like the monster.</v>

5301
02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:39.770
<v Speaker 4>He had legs that were perfectly designed for kicking you.</v>

5302
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 4>And this guy,</v>

5303
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:44.660
<v Speaker 4>when I wouldn't talk about like talented dudes,</v>

5304
02:21:44.661 --> 02:21:48.110
<v Speaker 4>like physically talented dudes who could throw kicks that no one saw coming.</v>

5305
02:21:48.350 --> 02:21:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I used to watch this guy kick like the bag and I would just be marveled,</v>

5306
02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:53.720
<v Speaker 4>just like marbled look.</v>

5307
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:56.000
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe what he could do with his legs.</v>

5308
02:21:56.210 --> 02:22:00.200
<v Speaker 4>He would throw these front leg side kick that which has been this bag in half</v>

5309
02:22:00.210 --> 02:22:01.250
<v Speaker 4>because he was a big dude.</v>

5310
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:01.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5311
02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:06.050
<v Speaker 4>Larry was probably like 220 natural pounds,</v>

5312
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:07.040
<v Speaker 4>six with three lien.</v>

5313
02:22:07.041 --> 02:22:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Didn't lift any weights,</v>

5314
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:09.560
<v Speaker 4>built for kicking bail for kicking.</v>

5315
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:10.251
<v Speaker 4>Like his,</v>

5316
02:22:10.251 --> 02:22:11.240
<v Speaker 4>all of his weight.</v>

5317
02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:12.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might,</v>

5318
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:13.250
<v Speaker 4>might not have been even that heavy.</v>

5319
02:22:13.251 --> 02:22:15.170
<v Speaker 4>It might've been like 200 pounds now that I think about it.</v>

5320
02:22:15.171 --> 02:22:16.910
<v Speaker 4>But he wasn't a weight lifter at all.</v>

5321
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:20.360
<v Speaker 4>Like it was all just throwing kicks and running up hills and shit like that.</v>

5322
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:21.140
<v Speaker 4>But he would,</v>

5323
02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:22.610
<v Speaker 4>he would kick the bag and you just go,</v>

5324
02:22:22.611 --> 02:22:24.140
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck man?</v>

5325
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd never seen anything like</v>

5326
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.101
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5327
02:22:26.101 --> 02:22:27.810
<v Speaker 2>He would throw these spinning techniques.</v>

5328
02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:29.430
<v Speaker 2>And ever since that I was like,</v>

5329
02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:29.581
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5330
02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:32.610
<v Speaker 2>how come I haven't seen a guy who couldn't move like that in mma?</v>

5331
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:35.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you start slowly seemed like Barboza can do it,</v>

5332
02:22:35.390 --> 02:22:35.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5333
02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:36.690
<v Speaker 2>a few other guys could do it.</v>

5334
02:22:36.691 --> 02:22:38.820
<v Speaker 2>They can move like that with that kind of speed and their spins.</v>

5335
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Barboza has the quickest kicks I've ever seen in my life.</v>

5336
02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>

5337
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 2>never seen anybody quick.</v>

5338
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a fight scheduled hopes?</v>

5339
02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:47.033
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

5340
02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I was telling Michael Jai White,</v>

5341
02:22:51.631 --> 02:22:51.940

5391
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Remember that was a center bag and the GSP bag as a bar back to the far right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

5579
02:28:57.850 --> 02:28:58.880
<v Speaker 2>No one's a hipster,</v>

02:28:59.090 --> 02:28:59.481
<v Speaker 2>but hey.</v>

02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it to 69 or [inaudible] 61.</v>

5583
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.980
<v Speaker 2>It says one to me.</v>

5584
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He probably took a giant shit and he came in and weighed himself again and he</v>

5585
02:29:10.191 --> 02:29:11.090
<v Speaker 2>was two 61</v>

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:14.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5588
02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Ties off Bruce Buffer.</v>

5589
02:29:18.030 --> 02:29:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I was on his podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Podcast?</v>

5593
02:29:22.101 --> 02:29:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I've been a natural host.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was shocked how good he was.</v>

5596
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:29.950
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a professional house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

5599
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:33.110
<v Speaker 2>We'll think about how good he is in route and announcer.</v>

5600
02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:33.973
<v Speaker 2>No one's better.</v>

5601
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Never been a big difference between ring announcer and holding down a shovel.</v>

5602
02:29:37.731 --> 02:29:38.960
<v Speaker 2>He has no off button.</v>

5603
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:39.830
<v Speaker 2>He has no off button.</v>

5604
02:29:39.831 --> 02:29:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him in at restaurants in fucking Venice.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had economy coming back from Sao Paulo,</v>

02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:07.220
<v Speaker 2>He was so cool.</v>

5623
02:30:07.221 --> 02:30:08.880
<v Speaker 2>He hooked it all up and like when you don't have to.</v>

5624
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5625
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I needed like 50,000 miles or something to do.</v>

5626
02:30:11.871 --> 02:30:13.970
<v Speaker 2>That shit was crazy and he hooked it up.</v>

5627
02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:14.180
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

5628
02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool.</v>

5629
02:30:15.180 --> 02:30:15.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

5630
02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:18.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a 15 hour flight Sao Paolo.</v>

5631
02:30:18.051 --> 02:30:19.850
<v Speaker 2>La Direct business class,</v>

5632
02:30:19.851 --> 02:30:20.684
<v Speaker 2>that was huge.</v>

5633
02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:23.330
<v Speaker 2>That was huge for the Rhonda fight.</v>

5634
02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I flew Rio to Sao Paulo,</v>

5635
02:30:25.071 --> 02:30:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Sao Paulo.</v>

5636
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:26.960
<v Speaker 2>One way.</v>

5637
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:29.030
<v Speaker 2>There's no one direct route from rail.</v>

5638
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5639
02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:30.051
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5640
02:30:30.051 --> 02:30:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Direct flight to Rio.</v>

5641
02:30:31.131 --> 02:30:34.070
<v Speaker 2>You fly to Miami and then you fly to Rio or Atlanta.</v>

5642
02:30:34.071 --> 02:30:34.731
<v Speaker 2>You fly.</v>

5643
02:30:34.731 --> 02:30:34.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5644
02:30:34.971 --> 02:30:36.260
<v Speaker 2>if I landed a Rio.</v>

5645
02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:37.460
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

5646
02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Sao Paulo is a direct flight from La,</v>

5647
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:40.010
<v Speaker 2>so I just went that way.</v>

5648
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Do I feel like these guys have to fight each other for the retire right,</v>

5649
02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:45.350
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5650
02:30:45.350 --> 02:30:46.183
<v Speaker 2>Good fight.</v>

5651
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:48.710
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be interested in such a fucking vet.</v>

5652
02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.720
<v Speaker 2>So as Roy Barnett thinks,</v>

5653
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:51.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5654
02:30:51.140 --> 02:30:53.720
<v Speaker 2>that he just has way too many tools and he fights too smart.</v>

5655
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:56.180
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that Roy is just too one dimensional.</v>

5656
02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting like that.</v>

5657
02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:01.220
<v Speaker 2>His approach to this fight was to get lean and to watch his diet,</v>

5658
02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:02.090
<v Speaker 2>whereas,</v>

5659
02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5660
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that's like counter completely counter to how Roy behaves.</v>

5661
02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Roy Roy is such an extreme fight,</v>

5662
02:31:08.931 --> 02:31:09.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5663
02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5664
02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:11.320
<v Speaker 2>To hire an entire kitchen king,</v>

5665
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:13.450
<v Speaker 2>pure fighters to vets.</v>

5666
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:14.293
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

5667
02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:18.210
<v Speaker 2>What was Roy's last fight?</v>

5668
02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:19.080
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5669
02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:21.240
<v Speaker 2>his last fight was a fight.</v>

5670
02:31:21.610 --> 02:31:24.000
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out by Mark Hunt and then you fight again after that.</v>

5671
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Before that he fought.</v>

5672
02:31:25.291 --> 02:31:25.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5673
02:31:25.501 --> 02:31:26.190
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't fought.</v>

5674
02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Before that he knocked out no Gira and then before that he lost so he had a</v>

5675
02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:30.793
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>

5676
02:31:31.050 --> 02:31:32.370
<v Speaker 2>giant victory over Nogueira,</v>

5677
02:31:32.371 --> 02:31:33.270
<v Speaker 2>which was crazy.</v>

5678
02:31:33.271 --> 02:31:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

5679
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:35.140
<v Speaker 2>That Abu Dhabi.</v>

5680
02:31:35.370 --> 02:31:36.390
<v Speaker 2>It was terrifying.</v>

5681
02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:36.960
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

5682
02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:37.793
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>

5683
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to fight ever again after terrifying knockout,</v>

5684
02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but so then he lost a DC Frank Mir law got knocked up by Mark Hunt.</v>

5685
02:31:46.350 --> 02:31:47.220
<v Speaker 2>They're not fighting.</v>

5686
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt one exposed like some holes in it.</v>

5687
02:31:50.291 --> 02:31:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Striking when you know Mark Hunt is just so slick and experience.</v>

5688
02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:55.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying,</v>

5689
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:56.190
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo.</v>

5695
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:07.530
<v Speaker 2>If you have your $2,000 in the hole,</v>

5696
02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you might have to rub his feet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5723
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:50.790
<v Speaker 2>God damn crazy that he's got the under hook on the wrong side here.</v>

5724
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:52.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not as he's got an under.</v>

5725
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:53.843
<v Speaker 2>It's got to like,</v>

5726
02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>he's got the insight under hook on the time.</v>

5727
02:32:57.420 --> 02:32:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Just just smelling his back.</v>

5728
02:32:59.330 --> 02:33:03.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a good keywords for an arm bar against uh,</v>

5729
02:33:03.580 --> 02:33:04.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5730
02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Ted Williams that if 10 years ago,</v>

5731
02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:08.240
<v Speaker 2>98</v>

5732
02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:11.133
<v Speaker 2>school man,</v>

5733
02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:14.370
<v Speaker 2>goddammit Ted,</v>

5734
02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:15.900
<v Speaker 2>remember Ted Williams got mad.</v>

5735
02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You always talk about how good the guard is.</v>

5736
02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:17.971
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

5737
02:33:17.971 --> 02:33:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Important to guard is,</v>

5738
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:19.111
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

5739
02:33:19.111 --> 02:33:21.630
<v Speaker 2>that was an article on truck doing the garden on me.</v>

5740
02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:22.141
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5741
02:33:22.141 --> 02:33:22.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5742
02:33:22.291 --> 02:33:24.200
<v Speaker 2>you're not the same size grappling,</v>

5743
02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:25.390
<v Speaker 2>grappling magazine.</v>

5744
02:33:26.770 --> 02:33:28.800
<v Speaker 2>He had an interview and it said the guard is dead.</v>

5745
02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:29.693
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who started.</v>

5746
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.830
<v Speaker 2>He started the garden.</v>

5747
02:33:31.831 --> 02:33:34.670
<v Speaker 2>He needs a row at Verdugo and then revise that statement.</v>

5748
02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it doesn't feel that or no revising statements from 15 years ago.</v>

5749
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:42.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people had some ideas about what didn't work.</v>

5750
02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Dot Spinning kicks,</v>

5751
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:46.680
<v Speaker 2>head kicks would never work and just like most people,</v>

5752
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:47.760
<v Speaker 2>most of them see fans,</v>

5753
02:33:48.090 --> 02:33:48.630
<v Speaker 2>head kicks,</v>

5754
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 2>only working in movies and Ted Williams is right when he saw the state of the</v>

5755
02:33:53.131 --> 02:33:56.610
<v Speaker 2>guard that was in gladiator competent or king of the cage.</v>

5756
02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And you weren't seeing the best of the best.</v>

5757
02:33:59.310 --> 02:33:59.601
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

5758
02:33:59.601 --> 02:34:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be like almost at the Jujitsu competitions or in,</v>

5759
02:34:02.890 --> 02:34:03.790
<v Speaker 2>in the labs,</v>

5760
02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:08.670
<v Speaker 2>like why are they still rare to see a guard pass?</v>

5761
02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Why are they standing?</v>

5762
02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:12.540
<v Speaker 2>That's pure shit.</v>

5763
02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:13.433
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

5764
02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5765
02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:15.450
<v Speaker 2>keep talking to Brian.</v>

5766
02:34:15.450 --> 02:34:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I keep throwing that left kick.</v>

5767
02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:18.580
<v Speaker 2>They want action,</v>

5768
02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:19.091
<v Speaker 3>Brendan.</v>

5769
02:34:19.091 --> 02:34:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Action.</v>

5770
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:23.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just pushing them nasty ass please.</v>

5771
02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5772
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:26.170
<v Speaker 3>you can't come straight in.</v>

5773
02:34:26.171 --> 02:34:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Line that against fucking Roy is going to come on Josh.</v>

5774
02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Come on Josh.</v>

5775
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:31.061
<v Speaker 3>Hold Jesus.</v>

5776
02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

5777
02:34:31.961 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 3>This is a free to get in trouble with his right hand.</v>

5778
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:36.610
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

5779
02:34:36.610 --> 02:34:36.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5780
02:34:36.791 --> 02:34:37.520
<v Speaker 3>nice opera.</v>

5781
02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:38.720
<v Speaker 3>That fucked Roy up.</v>

5782
02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:40.660
<v Speaker 3>It's got a tremendous team.</v>

5783
02:34:40.661 --> 02:34:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Has He ever been knocked out?</v>

5784
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hudson walked away.</v>

5785
02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett is really pouring it on.</v>

5786
02:34:45.821 --> 02:34:49.240
<v Speaker 3>It's shown some excellent cardio here on this land.</v>

5787
02:34:49.450 --> 02:34:53.170
<v Speaker 3>That might've been his plan though in this fight to come and so lean just really</v>

5788
02:34:53.171 --> 02:34:54.910
<v Speaker 3>poor cardio or the pace on them.</v>

5789
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:57.620
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense if you want to make a run for it.</v>

5790
02:34:59.200 --> 02:34:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Goodness,</v>

5791
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.410
<v Speaker 3>that hurt.</v>

5792
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:01.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

5793
02:35:02.530 --> 02:35:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

5794
02:35:03.130 --> 02:35:05.870
<v Speaker 3>We'll think about if you bring it to zero.</v>

5795
02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:06.101
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5796
02:35:06.101 --> 02:35:10.760
<v Speaker 3>That sneaky uppercut bar netspend throw onto Josh was looking for that arm drag.</v>

5797
02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Josh,</v>

5798
02:35:11.310 --> 02:35:12.380
<v Speaker 3>you want to make a run at the title?</v>

5799
02:35:12.380 --> 02:35:13.480
<v Speaker 3>He got to cardio man.</v>

5800
02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

5801
02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:15.993
<v Speaker 3>Big Knee.</v>

5802
02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:16.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5803
02:35:16.811 --> 02:35:17.261
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

5804
02:35:17.261 --> 02:35:19.720
<v Speaker 3>A man of a loss like that Travis Brown fight.</v>

5805
02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:20.980
<v Speaker 3>This guy's a warrior,</v>

5806
02:35:20.981 --> 02:35:22.480
<v Speaker 3>you know that lights a fire under a month.</v>

5807
02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.490
<v Speaker 3>They said he was fucking pissed.</v>

5808
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Of course he was pissed when he came on my podcast.</v>

5809
02:35:26.891 --> 02:35:27.760
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about it.</v>

5810
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:28.570
<v Speaker 3>He's mad about it.</v>

5811
02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:28.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5812
02:35:28.751 --> 02:35:33.060
<v Speaker 3>well that Travis had done the film across the next thing.</v>

5813
02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:36.240
<v Speaker 3>He thought that was like super disrespectful and he said he just,</v>

5814
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:38.940
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't up for that fight and you know,</v>

5815
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:39.461
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>

5816
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I've heard all sorts of stories about Barnett's camp that fight.</v>

5817
02:35:41.951 --> 02:35:43.390
<v Speaker 3>We have a mutual trading partner and he said,</v>

5818
02:35:43.391 --> 02:35:43.591
<v Speaker 3>pardon?</v>

5819
02:35:43.591 --> 02:35:45.010
<v Speaker 3>It's campus pure shit.</v>

5820
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:47.500
<v Speaker 3>So he's super upset about that man.</v>

5821
02:35:47.501 --> 02:35:49.840
<v Speaker 3>You know when a guy's been fighting for that long.</v>

5822
02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:50.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5823
02:35:50.011 --> 02:35:51.370
<v Speaker 3>One guys been fighting for that long.</v>

5824
02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:53.500
<v Speaker 3>It's probably hard to get up like that for every camp,</v>

5825
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:57.300
<v Speaker 3>but it takes him down.</v>

5826
02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:58.750
<v Speaker 3>He's winning.</v>

5827
02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:00.100
<v Speaker 3>This evolved.</v>

5828
02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:01.533
<v Speaker 3>He's evolved.</v>

5829
02:36:02.490 --> 02:36:03.570
<v Speaker 3>He never crashed down.</v>

5830
02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:04.300
<v Speaker 3>We'll never know.</v>

5831
02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:07.680
<v Speaker 3>He knows that it's trying to try and for that straight arm bar from his back do</v>

5832
02:36:07.681 --> 02:36:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you can tell he lost this railed roy money.</v>

5833
02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:13.840
<v Speaker 3>This is five rounds.</v>

5834
02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

5835
02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Which is bad for Roy.</v>

5836
02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:18.053
<v Speaker 3>One of five.</v>

5837
02:36:18.490 --> 02:36:19.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5838
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:20.171
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

5839
02:36:20.171 --> 02:36:20.381
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>

5840
02:36:20.381 --> 02:36:22.030
<v Speaker 3>He's going to go just to look at that nice life.</v>

5841
02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5842
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.281
<v Speaker 3>Henzel Gracie.</v>

5843
02:36:24.281 --> 02:36:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Black belt son.</v>

5844
02:36:25.850 --> 02:36:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5845
02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5846
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:28.240
<v Speaker 3>It's more like laundry room in black,</v>

5847
02:36:28.241 --> 02:36:32.330
<v Speaker 3>but he was with Mark Lehman longer than will henzel game as well as black.</v>

5848
02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:32.741
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>

5849
02:36:32.741 --> 02:36:33.071
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

5850
02:36:33.071 --> 02:36:33.331
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

5851
02:36:33.331 --> 02:36:35.620
<v Speaker 3>So mark claiming he did trade with her.</v>

5852
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5853
02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Good ground and pound by Roy.</v>

5854
02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Good fucking ground and pound from the half Barnett off his back.</v>

5855
02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Interesting that he's able to take Barnett down one.</v>

5856
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that like being leaner,</v>

5857
02:36:48.701 --> 02:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>losing weight makes you a little more vulnerable takedowns because the guy</v>

5858
02:36:52.631 --> 02:36:54.040
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to throw as much weight around.</v>

5859
02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Does that make any sense?</v>

5860
02:36:55.090 --> 02:36:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It does kind of make sense but only a little bit,</v>

5861
02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:01.120
<v Speaker 3>right a little bit because that's why there's weight divisions and wrestling</v>

5862
02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:05.500
<v Speaker 3>guys can take little guys down easy and those guys can take bigger deck guys</v>

5863
02:37:05.501 --> 02:37:05.741
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

5864
02:37:05.741 --> 02:37:06.260
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

5865
02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5866
02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:07.990
<v Speaker 3>how much people are killing themselves.</v>

5867
02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:12.430
<v Speaker 3>The question is like how much of Barnett's weight loss is like he's lost some</v>

5868
02:37:12.431 --> 02:37:13.420
<v Speaker 3>fat clearly,</v>

5869
02:37:13.421 --> 02:37:13.721
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5870
02:37:13.721 --> 02:37:14.920
<v Speaker 3>To get down like 10.</v>

5871
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:17.070
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is important in college?</v>

5872
02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:22.240
<v Speaker 3>How much lighter is 15 to 30 minutes to 64.</v>

5873
02:37:23.130 --> 02:37:24.470
<v Speaker 3>He lost 25 pounds.</v>

5874
02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Really 25 to 65 years.</v>

5875
02:37:26.681 --> 02:37:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Always weighed in for the Travis Browne fight was actually.</v>

5876
02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:32.093
<v Speaker 3>He was more like,</v>

5877
02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:33.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5878
02:37:33.430 --> 02:37:34.263
<v Speaker 3>about to 65.</v>

5879
02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:35.213
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

5880
02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:37.220
<v Speaker 3>so he lost some fat right now.</v>

5881
02:37:37.221 --> 02:37:38.750
<v Speaker 3>How did wrestle in college?</v>

5882
02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett?</v>

5883
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Josh.</v>

5884
02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he did.</v>

5885
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:42.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he did.</v>

5886
02:37:42.441 --> 02:37:43.700
<v Speaker 3>It was probably a junior college.</v>

5887
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5888
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:47.300
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not that shocked that he's being taken down here.</v>

5889
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:49.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he was a world class wrestler.</v>

5890
02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

5891
02:37:49.450 --> 02:37:50.480
<v Speaker 3>No one takes josh down.</v>

5892
02:37:50.481 --> 02:37:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

5893
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:51.681
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty rare.</v>

5894
02:37:51.681 --> 02:37:53.680
<v Speaker 3>But he's a DC to DC.</v>

5895
02:37:54.570 --> 02:37:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I think DC did.</v>

5896
02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

5897
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:58.343
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

02:37:58.700 --> 02:37:59.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

5899
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Throwing haymakers get that money.</v>

5900
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you a 50 percent buddy.</v>

5901
02:38:04.461 --> 02:38:04.731
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

5902
02:38:04.731 --> 02:38:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Roy Nelson does not look like he's in bad shape here.</v>

5903
02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:07.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5904
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:08.920
<v Speaker 3>don't let that get fool young</v>

5905
02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:12.410
<v Speaker 3>boy to God.</v>

5906
02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>

5907
02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Roy has looking at voice,</v>

5908
02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:14.953
<v Speaker 3>throwing kicks.</v>

5909
02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:16.013
<v Speaker 3>He's got some.</v>

5910
02:38:16.580 --> 02:38:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Sun Is hurt.</v>

5911
02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

5912
02:38:19.281 --> 02:38:20.114
<v Speaker 3>Roy Hits hard.</v>

5913
02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Joshua some big ass legs.</v>

5914
02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:23.523
<v Speaker 3>That's how.</v>

5915
02:38:23.890 --> 02:38:28.890
<v Speaker 3>So I got to go even gay because I would say there's some juicy thighs,</v>

5916
02:38:28.941 --> 02:38:29.840
<v Speaker 3>but a flat ass.</v>

5917
02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:30.890
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad luck on.</v>

5918
02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

5919
02:38:31.430 --> 02:38:32.240
<v Speaker 3>This is interesting.</v>

5920
02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I remember hanging out with years ago,</v>

5921
02:38:34.911 --> 02:38:38.690
<v Speaker 3>never ever imagined he would be a UFC superstar.</v>

5922
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Blocking people out.</v>

5923
02:38:40.170 --> 02:38:40.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5924
02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:42.860
<v Speaker 3>that's the last thing I ever would've imagined.</v>

5925
02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:43.131
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

5926
02:38:43.131 --> 02:38:45.610
<v Speaker 3>We had breakfast with him at the,</v>

5927
02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.540
<v Speaker 3>the hotel in that little cafe before we ever had an mma fight and we knew him as</v>

5928
02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.160
<v Speaker 3>a Jujitsu guy.</v>

5929
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:54.230
<v Speaker 3>He was a dude who was really good at Jujitsu.</v>

5930
02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Roy with four fights.</v>

5931
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

5932
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:59.390
<v Speaker 3>He turned into a brawl.</v>

5933
02:39:00.350 --> 02:39:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

5934
02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:01.341
<v Speaker 3>good check.</v>

5935
02:39:01.341 --> 02:39:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Hooked by Josh to 48 to 48.</v>

5936
02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:05.630
<v Speaker 3>So he wasn't that much heavier for that fight.</v>

5937
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:10.290
<v Speaker 3>He was only nine pounds heavier for you look like shit man.</v>

5938
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.830
<v Speaker 3>His body looked like she's put on muscle mass fat,</v>

5939
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:16.730
<v Speaker 3>but he definitely hasn't lost 25 pounds according to that when at least.</v>

5940
02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:18.560
<v Speaker 3>But he looks good,</v>

5941
02:39:18.561 --> 02:39:18.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5942
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:19.970
<v Speaker 3>This is about as good fit.</v>

5943
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:21.590
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't look week is what I'm saying.</v>

5944
02:39:21.591 --> 02:39:22.850
<v Speaker 3>So you're always taking them down.</v>

5945
02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think that that's the factor.</v>

5946
02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just Roy is catching them in transitions.</v>

5947
02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

5948
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.943
<v Speaker 3>Straight left.</v>

5949
02:39:31.970 --> 02:39:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Bro.</v>

5950
02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Barnett boys are trading.</v>

5951
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Barnett also looks like he's been.</v>

5952
02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.180
<v Speaker 3>He's been turned it on,</v>

5953
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:42.780
<v Speaker 3>turned it on in this standup like that after initial Florida.</v>

5954
02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.280
<v Speaker 3>That was very good.</v>

5955
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful Dude.</v>

5956
02:39:46.650 --> 02:39:49.300
<v Speaker 3>He's fucked up and he's pouring it on him.</v>

5962
02:39:56.721 --> 02:40:01.721
<v Speaker 3>and he's waiting for Roy to get tired before he pours it on to fighting crafty</v>

5963
02:40:02.311 --> 02:40:05.790
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning part of the Brown and then he hits around three minutes in.</v>

5964
02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:07.170
<v Speaker 3>He starts really turning it on.</v>

5965
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.961
<v Speaker 3>Veterans Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he also knows Roy Roy.</v>

5969
02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:12.930
<v Speaker 3>A lot of damage,</v>

5970
02:40:12.930 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 3>but trying to touch the ground.</v>

5971
02:40:13.950 --> 02:40:15.810
<v Speaker 3>You can't be at your best with that body.</v>

5972
02:40:15.811 --> 02:40:16.644
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

5973
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's just girls like that,</v>

5977
02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:21.340
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

5978
02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:22.520
<v Speaker 3>But let's go bro.</v>

5979
02:40:22.521 --> 02:40:23.354
<v Speaker 3>Let's say Roy,</v>

5980
02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:26.300
<v Speaker 3>let's say Roy gets down to 2:20 [inaudible].</v>

5981
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Is he going to be this?</v>

5982
02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Is He gave me the same power puncher or is that right hand go away?</v>

5983
02:40:29.930 --> 02:40:31.240
<v Speaker 3>That's a super good question too.</v>

5984
02:40:31.241 --> 02:40:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

5985
02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:32.481
<v Speaker 3>No one could know,</v>

5986
02:40:32.481 --> 02:40:32.721
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5987
02:40:32.721 --> 02:40:34.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't know until he tries it and he's never tried it.</v>

5988
02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:35.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5989
02:40:35.541 --> 02:40:35.641
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

5990
02:40:35.641 --> 02:40:37.190
<v Speaker 3>we might see a better roy than ever.</v>

5991
02:40:37.191 --> 02:40:37.911
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

5992
02:40:37.911 --> 02:40:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Josh is looking good.</v>

5993
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:41.600
<v Speaker 3>He's relentless here with his standard is bleeding.</v>

5994
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.800
<v Speaker 3>It's Josh.</v>

5995
02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.800
<v Speaker 3>His nose on a shoulder in agony means taking some big breaths.</v>

5996
02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Josh keeps hitting that solar plexus to.</v>

5997
02:40:51.350 --> 02:40:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Did you know when Josh would have a stitch corner on which this hurts?</v>

5998
02:40:54.861 --> 02:40:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm for sure not.</v>

5999
02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:55.881
<v Speaker 3>Haven't stitched.</v>

6000
02:40:55.881 --> 02:40:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Because you still only fight with stitch before we went.</v>

6001
02:40:58.281 --> 02:40:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Knocked on detail.</v>

6002
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.361
<v Speaker 3>Stitch.</v>

6003
02:40:59.361 --> 02:41:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Let me die in there.</v>

6004
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I still stitch the opposite.</v>

6005
02:41:02.511 --> 02:41:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Don't let me die.</v>

6006
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:04.063
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

6007
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I'd say stitch.</v>

6008
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:07.191
<v Speaker 3>Look at me Bro.</v>

6009
02:41:07.191 --> 02:41:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Don't let me fucking die.</v>

6010
02:41:08.151 --> 02:41:10.940
<v Speaker 3>And there josh say the exact opposite.</v>

6011
02:41:11.050 --> 02:41:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

6012
02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:12.021
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking,</v>

6013
02:41:12.021 --> 02:41:12.621
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

6014

<v Speaker 3>that's gangster.</v>

6015
02:41:13.310 --> 02:41:13.671
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

6016
02:41:13.671 --> 02:41:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Jamie was to 65 that fight.</v>

6017
02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:15.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6018
02:41:15.501 --> 02:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

6019
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.880
<v Speaker 3>So boom.</v>

6020
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:17.990
<v Speaker 3>So it was incorrect.</v>

6021
02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:18.973
<v Speaker 3>We're giving you a pallet.</v>

6022
02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:19.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6023
02:41:19.461 --> 02:41:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you're 100 percent right.</v>

6024
02:41:20.361 --> 02:41:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Then that's 100 percent right?</v>

6025
02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:24.091
<v Speaker 3>More so.</v>

6026
02:41:24.091 --> 02:41:24.924
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6027
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

6028
02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:27.710
<v Speaker 3>this is nasty.</v>

6029
02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:32.180
<v Speaker 3>It can be inserted.</v>

6030
02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:33.340
<v Speaker 3>This thing goes off five.</v>

6031
02:41:34.210 --> 02:41:35.043
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

6032
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.943
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

6033
02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a 26 pounds,</v>

6034
02:41:37.961 --> 02:41:38.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6035
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.260
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

6036
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:39.740
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

6037
02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:40.720
<v Speaker 3>just 2:39.</v>

6038
02:41:40.721 --> 02:41:41.920
<v Speaker 3>So he lost 26 pounds.</v>

6039
02:41:42.130 --> 02:41:42.911
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

6040
02:41:42.911 --> 02:41:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Talking about dedication.</v>

6041
02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.080
<v Speaker 3>That elbow data.</v>

6042
02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Josh has mad that Reebok didn't make it.</v>

6043
02:41:48.491 --> 02:41:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Speedo Reebok.</v>

6044
02:41:51.010 --> 02:41:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Dennis hallman's pissed.</v>

6045
02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:53.351
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6046
02:41:53.351 --> 02:41:53.651
<v Speaker 3>Josh,</v>

6047
02:41:53.651 --> 02:41:54.610
<v Speaker 3>you still is fighting those.</v>

6048
02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:55.331
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

6049
02:41:55.331 --> 02:41:56.320
<v Speaker 3>There's that one again.</v>

6050
02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:57.241
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

6051
02:41:57.241 --> 02:41:58.300
<v Speaker 3>His clenches nasty.</v>

6052
02:41:58.301 --> 02:41:59.134
<v Speaker 3>This fight.</v>

6053
02:41:59.410 --> 02:42:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't see how much hell Roy Roy has done.</v>

6054
02:42:02.050 --> 02:42:03.770
<v Speaker 3>He is tight as possible.</v>

6055
02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:05.790
<v Speaker 3>That's not possible.</v>

6056
02:42:07.850 --> 02:42:08.683
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

6057
02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6058
02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:15.400
<v Speaker 3>and Josh comes back as he's playing possum and he throws a head.</v>

6059
02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Fucking saw that head kick and rock them.</v>

6060
02:42:20.951 --> 02:42:22.480
<v Speaker 3>But then Barnett rock them back.</v>

6061
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Is that his first head kick?</v>

6062
02:42:23.441 --> 02:42:24.010
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

6063
02:42:24.010 --> 02:42:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I would assume so.</v>

6064
02:42:25.540 --> 02:42:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Especially in the UFC.</v>

6065
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:29.320
<v Speaker 3>That was some straight panda bear shit,</v>

6066
02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6067
02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:31.630
<v Speaker 3>That tattoo he has on his shoulder,</v>

6068
02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:32.141
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>

6069
02:42:32.141 --> 02:42:32.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6070
02:42:32.470 --> 02:42:32.830
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>

6071
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:33.760
<v Speaker 3>He had a shirt,</v>

6072
02:42:33.850 --> 02:42:37.570
<v Speaker 3>a apparel line back when he was like a purple belt in Jujitsu.</v>

6073
02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:37.831
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

6074
02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:37.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6075
02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:39.790
<v Speaker 3>eight or something like that or stuff like that.</v>

6076
02:42:39.791 --> 02:42:40.390
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>

6077
02:42:40.390 --> 02:42:41.560
<v Speaker 3>he was gonna make his money that way.</v>

6078
02:42:42.290 --> 02:42:44.200
<v Speaker 3>The skins.</v>

6079
02:42:44.350 --> 02:42:48.160
<v Speaker 3>He had dragon skins once that member that they're the rash guards.</v>

6080
02:42:48.161 --> 02:42:50.620
<v Speaker 3>He had like a really good brand of rash guards.</v>

6081
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:52.270
<v Speaker 3>That was his.</v>

6082
02:42:53.050 --> 02:42:53.741
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it.</v>

6083
02:42:53.741 --> 02:42:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the local.</v>

6084
02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it because I,</v>

6085
02:42:55.621 --> 02:42:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I used to tell him he shot too.</v>

6086
02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:58.840
<v Speaker 3>He sent them to me once.</v>

6087
02:42:59.010 --> 02:43:00.550
<v Speaker 3>You had like the best rash card.</v>

6088
02:43:00.551 --> 02:43:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

6089
02:43:00.990 --> 02:43:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6090
02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:02.253
<v Speaker 3>Just stopped doing them.</v>

6091
02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:03.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

6092
02:43:03.281 --> 02:43:03.491
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6093
02:43:03.491 --> 02:43:04.324
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

6094
02:43:04.450 --> 02:43:09.190
<v Speaker 3>But he had rash cars was like a really good material that like wick sweat away</v>

6095
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:09.850
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

6096
02:43:09.850 --> 02:43:11.420
<v Speaker 3>They were really good rash guards.</v>

6097
02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Roy's always</v>

6098
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:13.240
<v Speaker 2>been a smart guy,</v>

6099
02:43:13.241 --> 02:43:14.074
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6100
02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:17.020
<v Speaker 2>He's always been on the outside of this tough texture.</v>

6101
02:43:17.021 --> 02:43:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It was soft,</v>

6102
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:19.120
<v Speaker 2>but it was a tough texture.</v>

6103
02:43:19.270 --> 02:43:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And the idea I think was that it was really good for grappling.</v>

6104
02:43:21.901 --> 02:43:23.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] wouldn't tear as easy as like,</v>

6105
02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 2>it's cool a regular rash guard,</v>

6106
02:43:24.911 --> 02:43:25.990
<v Speaker 2>which has meant for surfing,</v>

6107
02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:26.710
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6108
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:27.543
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

6109
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6110
02:43:27.731 --> 02:43:30.760
<v Speaker 2>He's always been kind of the smart guy doing different shit.</v>

6111
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He's always gone against the grain always.</v>

6112
02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:33.850
<v Speaker 2>That's been ryman.</v>

6113
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So what happens now after that second round,</v>

6114
02:43:36.311 --> 02:43:37.420
<v Speaker 2>that second round was crazy.</v>

6115
02:43:38.650 --> 02:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>It's one one.</v>

6116
02:43:39.810 --> 02:43:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6117
02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:40.750
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>

6118
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:40.991
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

6119
02:43:40.991 --> 02:43:41.830
<v Speaker 2>This goes all five.</v>

6120
02:43:41.831 --> 02:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I think Burnett for boy hits him with one of those fucking head kicks.</v>

6121
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:48.260
<v Speaker 2>What are we talking about?</v>

6122
02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:53.200
<v Speaker 2>If Roy landed that head kick and Barnett toes curled.</v>

6123
02:43:53.210 --> 02:43:54.610
<v Speaker 2>So we'd be like,</v>

6124
02:43:54.611 --> 02:43:55.061
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

6125
02:43:55.061 --> 02:43:57.160
<v Speaker 2>In the greatest knockout in heavyweight history.</v>

6126
02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:58.091
<v Speaker 2>Here we go,</v>

6127
02:43:58.091 --> 02:43:58.631
<v Speaker 2>round three,</v>

6128
02:43:58.631 --> 02:43:59.464
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6129
02:44:00.610 --> 02:44:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

6130
02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Both these guys are so fucking mentally tough.</v>

6131
02:44:03.610 --> 02:44:05.320
<v Speaker 2>You're not breaking either one of these.</v>

6132
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Nice uppercut and he kicked me,</v>

6133
02:44:06.791 --> 02:44:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6134
02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:10.660
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like Roy has to empty the gas tank early because he's got to try to</v>

6135
02:44:10.661 --> 02:44:11.231
<v Speaker 2>hurt Josh.</v>

6136
02:44:11.231 --> 02:44:11.531
<v Speaker 2>Wally.</v>

6137
02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:12.364
<v Speaker 2>Ken Too.</v>

6138
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Those take downs or fresh.</v>

6139
02:44:14.050 --> 02:44:16.930
<v Speaker 2>He keeps get them down like this with a body of was trips.</v>

6140
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:17.983
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6141
02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:19.480
<v Speaker 2>those knees are nasty.</v>

6142
02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Barnett's layman attempting to take him down.</v>

6143
02:44:21.941 --> 02:44:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that's interesting.</v>

6144
02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It is with Barnett's Fao heavy is on top.</v>

6145
02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:28.960
<v Speaker 2>While I think once a roy got on top of him to in that first round,</v>

6146
02:44:28.961 --> 02:44:29.651
<v Speaker 2>that was no fun.</v>

6147
02:44:29.651 --> 02:44:29.801
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6148
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:30.101
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

6149
02:44:30.101 --> 02:44:30.401
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

6150
02:44:30.401 --> 02:44:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

6151
02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Roy's kind of respected game.</v>

6152
02:44:32.770 --> 02:44:33.001
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

6153
02:44:33.001 --> 02:44:33.834
<v Speaker 2>his GRANDPA,</v>

6154
02:44:34.570 --> 02:44:36.580
<v Speaker 2>although we don't see it very often in his fights,</v>

6155
02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:36.880
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

6156
02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:37.990
<v Speaker 2>It's very high level.</v>

6157
02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:38.853
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows it.</v>

6158
02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:40.030
<v Speaker 2>He's strong as fuck.</v>

6159
02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:41.193
<v Speaker 2>He's no joke.</v>

6160
02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:43.900
<v Speaker 2>These are good knees inside of the leg here.</v>

6161
02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm more impressed with Barnett.</v>

6162
02:44:45.131 --> 02:44:45.581
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>

6163
02:44:45.581 --> 02:44:47.470
<v Speaker 2>How far it's come along in the clench.</v>

6164
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Can tell he's working.</v>

6165
02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm only tie.</v>

6166
02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:50.520
<v Speaker 2>He does a lot of crazy shit to like.</v>

6167
02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Josh does savant and stuff like that.</v>

6168
02:44:52.250 --> 02:44:53.860
<v Speaker 2>He has like a savant trainer.</v>

6169
02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:54.760
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting dude,</v>

6170
02:44:54.761 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6171
02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:56.291
<v Speaker 2>Very smart guy.</v>

6172
02:44:56.291 --> 02:44:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6173
02:44:56.620 --> 02:45:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Are you for or against male UFC fighters and wearing rash guards?</v>

6174
02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:05.283
<v Speaker 2>Will they let</v>

6175
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:07.990
<v Speaker 2>they let the women would have guys wanted to.</v>

6176
02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Where would you be against that?</v>

6177
02:45:09.430 --> 02:45:11.890
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of girls wear long sleeve though.</v>

6178
02:45:12.730 --> 02:45:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a rash guards.</v>

6179
02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

6180
02:45:15.310 --> 02:45:17.170
<v Speaker 2>but would you be happy with just chest?</v>

6181
02:45:17.171 --> 02:45:17.441
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

6182
02:45:17.441 --> 02:45:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would think rash guards would mean like greasing obviously an MMA</v>

6183
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:23.950
<v Speaker 2>pepperoni or accusing.</v>

6184
02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Anytime a fighter.</v>

6185
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:28.360
<v Speaker 2>It's going to fight some guy that's known for Jujitsu.</v>

6186
02:45:28.570 --> 02:45:29.830
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't grease up,</v>

6187
02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:31.000
<v Speaker 2>nobody's checking.</v>

6188
02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:32.480
<v Speaker 2>He'd be in a check now.</v>

6189
02:45:33.010 --> 02:45:33.843
<v Speaker 2>How do they check?</v>

6190
02:45:34.590 --> 02:45:35.480
<v Speaker 2>You get patted down.</v>

6191
02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:36.140
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

6192
02:45:36.140 --> 02:45:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Here's the test.</v>

6193
02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:37.653
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

6194
02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Separated in separately to clench</v>

6195
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.421
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

6196
02:45:43.421 --> 02:45:44.254
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

6197
02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:45.440
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean nothing.</v>

6198
02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:46.541
<v Speaker 2>Can't do anything.</v>

6199
02:45:46.541 --> 02:45:51.260
<v Speaker 2>If they give you a mineral oil bath the night before and then they wash oil</v>

6200
02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:52.770
<v Speaker 2>still there and no one's ever been.</v>

6201
02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:56.350
<v Speaker 2>The only way to really do it would be like after a fight they'd be a guy that's</v>

6202
02:45:56.351 --> 02:45:59.710
<v Speaker 2>assigned to that take the swab and doesn't like that across your back.</v>

6203
02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's an epidemic.</v>

6204
02:46:01.061 --> 02:46:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's like a huge issue.</v>

6205
02:46:02.650 --> 02:46:03.483
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

6206
02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:07.030
<v Speaker 2>people are always complaining that people,</v>

6207
02:46:07.031 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to fight a guy who's in St submission guy and</v>

6208
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.280
<v Speaker 4>you know that you could take a mineral oil bath the night before and take a</v>

6209
02:46:13.281 --> 02:46:17.300
<v Speaker 4>shower and soap up the day after and it will still have an effect that won't be</v>

6210
02:46:17.301 --> 02:46:21.950
<v Speaker 4>measurable because like people are smoother and slicker after they do that.</v>

6211
02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Even after they take a shower.</v>

6212
02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 4>When you play vaseline on fighters eyes that she gets all over the body,</v>

6213
02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:30.440
<v Speaker 4>touched the face,</v>

6214
02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:31.040
<v Speaker 4>grappling,</v>

6215
02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:31.910
<v Speaker 4>it gets on their back.</v>

6216
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:35.030
<v Speaker 4>They all of a sudden the guy's full filled up with vaseline for sure.</v>

6217
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Well remember when Anderson Silva wiped it off his face and wiped it on his</v>

6218
02:46:38.091 --> 02:46:39.410
<v Speaker 4>shoulders and his chest.</v>

6219
02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:40.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6220
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:41.170
<v Speaker 4>Clay Gregan choke.</v>

6221
02:46:41.180 --> 02:46:42.360
<v Speaker 4>His brother slap it on.</v>

6222
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:43.401
<v Speaker 4>When he slap him,</v>

6223
02:46:43.401 --> 02:46:43.871
<v Speaker 4>he got in trouble.</v>

6224
02:46:43.871 --> 02:46:44.870
<v Speaker 4>We can't slap them anymore.</v>

6225
02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:45.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6226
02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Is I think they should let fighters.</v>

6227
02:46:47.931 --> 02:46:51.460
<v Speaker 4>Were Reebok rash guards know how much money reebok with nick.</v>

6228
02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they'd make any more money than they're making with these shorts.</v>

6229
02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:54.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6230
02:46:54.591 --> 02:46:57.380
<v Speaker 4>the fighters that I couldn't make reebok rash guards wouldn't be huge.</v>

6231
02:46:57.381 --> 02:46:59.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that in touch that market,</v>

6232
02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:04.300
<v Speaker 4>whereas when Pat Miletich fought Carlos Newton and Jeremy Horn like a,</v>

6233
02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:06.870
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

6234
02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I think it was that fight where he puts vaseline on on Pat's neck was one of the</v>

6235
02:47:12.591 --> 02:47:13.380
<v Speaker 4>fights where he put it out.</v>

6236
02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:16.810
<v Speaker 4>There was like a miscommunication and a bad idea to stanley.</v>

6237
02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a Jeremy fucked up.</v>

6238
02:47:18.741 --> 02:47:19.461
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who fucked up,</v>

6239
02:47:19.461 --> 02:47:23.240
<v Speaker 4>but there was somehow maybe Jeremy thought that Pat said put it on my neck.</v>

6240
02:47:23.241 --> 02:47:24.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the details.</v>

6241
02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:25.011
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

6242
02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:25.311
<v Speaker 4>This fight.</v>

6243
02:47:25.311 --> 02:47:26.080
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

6244
02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:26.913
<v Speaker 4>Running us her.</v>

6245
02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:29.420
<v Speaker 4>He just took a big deep breath looking for the single.</v>

6246
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6247
02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.540
<v Speaker 4>if he gets them down another single leg,</v>

6248
02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:35.960
<v Speaker 4>look at this Roy Nelson.</v>

6249
02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Snap that leg straight.</v>

6250
02:47:37.430 --> 02:47:39.170
<v Speaker 4>That's exhausting for Roy by the way.</v>

6251
02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:40.190
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

6252
02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:43.850
<v Speaker 4>But is it more exhausting than standing up and dealing with a barrage of strikes</v>

6253
02:47:43.851 --> 02:47:45.440
<v Speaker 4>that just keeps putting on him?</v>

6254
02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:47.930
<v Speaker 4>What kind of testing did they do in Japan?</v>

6255
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:49.550
<v Speaker 4>So great point.</v>

6256
02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:51.163
<v Speaker 4>UFC tests.</v>

6257
02:47:52.390 --> 02:47:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Is the u s Ada doing it?</v>

6258
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Who's doing it well are well.</v>

6259
02:47:57.380 --> 02:47:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Aren't the UFC fighters all tested randomly?</v>

6260
02:47:59.601 --> 02:47:59.960
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

6261
02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:00.561
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

6262
02:48:00.561 --> 02:48:00.741
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

6263
02:48:00.741 --> 02:48:01.100
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

6264
02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:01.590
<v Speaker 4>But you got to,</v>

6265
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:05.270
<v Speaker 4>it's September third is you have to fill out this sheet where you've got to give</v>

6266
02:48:05.271 --> 02:48:06.320
<v Speaker 4>them your location,</v>

6267
02:48:06.321 --> 02:48:07.154
<v Speaker 4>your whereabouts,</v>

6268
02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:09.080
<v Speaker 4>so they can come get you at anytime.</v>

6269
02:48:09.410 --> 02:48:10.243
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6270
02:48:10.650 --> 02:48:11.483
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6271
02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:12.753
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

6272
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.820
<v Speaker 4>what is a,</v>

6273
02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.810
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how they're getting tested after this fight,</v>

6274
02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:18.650
<v Speaker 4>not doing roids anymore because of this,</v>

6275
02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:20.070
<v Speaker 4>that you think they're scared and they're like,</v>

6276
02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:21.380
<v Speaker 4>or what are they doing?</v>

6277
02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:22.393
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

6278
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:23.210
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

6279
02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:26.510
<v Speaker 4>what do you take them to get around this?</v>

6280
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:28.530
<v Speaker 4>These new testing schedules?</v>

6281
02:48:30.140 --> 02:48:32.180
<v Speaker 4>Some of them for sure are going to stop doing it.</v>

6282
02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Some are 100 percent.</v>

6283
02:48:33.561 --> 02:48:33.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

6284
02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:34.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6285
02:48:34.250 --> 02:48:35.210
<v Speaker 4>it's always an issue though.</v>

6286
02:48:35.210 --> 02:48:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Wicki said that was pretty interesting.</v>

6287
02:48:36.980 --> 02:48:40.880
<v Speaker 4>He said they figured out a way to make testosterone from animals that's</v>

6288
02:48:40.881 --> 02:48:41.840
<v Speaker 4>undetectable.</v>

6289
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Like now they can tell if it,</v>

6290
02:48:44.361 --> 02:48:44.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6291
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:48.800
<v Speaker 4>they make it from yams to make it from some wild Yam.</v>

6292
02:48:48.801 --> 02:48:50.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck they make.</v>

6293
02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:55.091
<v Speaker 4>And I was talking about micro dosing to kick to the body boom to the head.</v>

6294
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:56.503
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

6295
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.220
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

6296
02:48:57.220 --> 02:48:59.840
<v Speaker 4>The Bolo Punches God damn.</v>

6297
02:48:59.841 --> 02:49:00.674
<v Speaker 4>What a fight.</v>

6298
02:49:00.810 --> 02:49:01.161
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

6299
02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Around three?</v>

6300
02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:02.793
<v Speaker 4>That was around three.</v>

6301
02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:03.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6302
02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:03.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6303
02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:04.071
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

6304
02:49:04.071 --> 02:49:04.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6305
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.761
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6306
02:49:04.761 --> 02:49:05.840
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about microdosing,</v>

6307
02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 4>but he was also talking about a new form</v>

6308
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:12.510
<v Speaker 3>of testosterone that they've been able to do that they make out of animals.</v>

6309
02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I guess the test before could show that it didn't come from an animal,</v>

6310
02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:21.330
<v Speaker 3>that it came from some plant plant form.</v>

6311
02:49:21.810 --> 02:49:22.351
<v Speaker 3>The way they,</v>

6312
02:49:22.351 --> 02:49:22.531
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6313
02:49:22.531 --> 02:49:23.364
<v Speaker 3>they create it.</v>

6314
02:49:23.370 --> 02:49:24.890
<v Speaker 3>So now apparently they're there.</v>

6315
02:49:24.891 --> 02:49:25.880
<v Speaker 3>They're able to do that.</v>

6316
02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:28.950
<v Speaker 3>We were also talking about the Tour de France.</v>

6317
02:49:29.430 --> 02:49:29.970
<v Speaker 3>What's so funny,</v>

6318
02:49:29.970 --> 02:49:30.803
<v Speaker 3>we laugh.</v>

6319
02:49:30.810 --> 02:49:34.950
<v Speaker 2>They had that band Europe taking the final countdown.</v>

6320
02:49:36.310 --> 02:49:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I can just imagine like their manager calling them and then say we've got some</v>

6321
02:49:39.721 --> 02:49:40.554
<v Speaker 2>good news,</v>

6322
02:49:43.530 --> 02:49:44.610
<v Speaker 2>national commercial,</v>

6323
02:49:44.930 --> 02:49:45.763
<v Speaker 2>good news.</v>

6324
02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:47.610
<v Speaker 2>The bad news is going to make fun of you.</v>

6325
02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:51.480
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a microwave.</v>

6326
02:49:51.481 --> 02:49:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Probably didn't know the managers.</v>

6327
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:54.210
<v Speaker 2>They don't tell them until I get that.</v>

6328
02:49:54.330 --> 02:49:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they did in the middle of the commercial shoot and they kind of figured</v>

6329
02:49:57.661 --> 02:49:57.961
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

6330
02:49:57.961 --> 02:49:58.794
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

6331
02:49:58.890 --> 02:49:59.723
<v Speaker 2>They're goofing on.</v>

6332
02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:03.660
<v Speaker 2>You think they give a fuck dumb shit.</v>

6333
02:50:03.661 --> 02:50:05.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's still their song.</v>

6334
02:50:05.001 --> 02:50:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6335
02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:05.841
<v Speaker 2>they're still doing it.</v>

6336
02:50:05.841 --> 02:50:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like national campaign.</v>

6337
02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Here we go round for a championship rounds.</v>

6338
02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:14.400
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that this is actually fought in a pretty fucking good pace.</v>

6339
02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Barnett with a high kick man.</v>

6340
02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6341
02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:17.650
<v Speaker 2>look at the body chapter.</v>

6342
02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Still got gas.</v>

6343
02:50:18.781 --> 02:50:19.614
<v Speaker 2>Look at him</v>

6344
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:20.700
<v Speaker 3>pouring it onto</v>

6345
02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Barnett up three to one,</v>

6346
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:26.463
<v Speaker 3>two to one.</v>

6347
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:31.500
<v Speaker 3>If I was really absolutely doing practicing bitch,</v>

6348
02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tagged back to zero.</v>

6349
02:50:33.751 --> 02:50:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I to zero as soon as it's over.</v>

6350
02:50:36.030 --> 02:50:37.560
<v Speaker 3>But when you think about the first round,</v>

6351
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:40.140
<v Speaker 3>didn't Barnett do way more damage on the feet.</v>

6352
02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Taken down twice and dominated.</v>

6353
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Didn't Barnett do more damage on the feet and he did it,</v>

6354
02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:46.613
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>

6355
02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:47.533
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>

6356
02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:48.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6357
02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:50.100
<v Speaker 3>but it shouldn't matter.</v>

6358
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:51.203
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't matter.</v>

6359
02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Like who got hurt more in that first round?</v>

6360
02:50:52.861 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I would say roy did.</v>

6361
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I would say Josh did more damage standing up.</v>

6362
02:50:57.070 --> 02:50:57.903
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

6363
02:50:59.470 --> 02:51:00.303
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>great job.</v>

6366
02:51:04.090 --> 02:51:05.290
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't decide to go,</v>

6367
02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:06.370
<v Speaker 2>go for it right there.</v>

6368
02:51:06.371 --> 02:51:07.360
<v Speaker 2>He would've been on his back.</v>

6369
02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:09.160
<v Speaker 2>That was a fucking great guy.</v>

6370
02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:10.271
<v Speaker 2>Quick decision.</v>

6371
02:51:10.271 --> 02:51:11.770
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep going with that wizard.</v>

6372
02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:12.783
<v Speaker 2>Pam,</v>

6373
02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:13.781
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett.</v>

6374
02:51:13.781 --> 02:51:18.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just he's in better shape in this fight that I've seen him in a deal about</v>

6375
02:51:18.060 --> 02:51:20.470
<v Speaker 2>someone stomping on your feet as a dirty or is it part of the game</v>

6376
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:21.790
<v Speaker 3>fighting part of the game?</v>

6377
02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:22.713
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6378
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett tying his arm out punches to the body needs the body butter that</v>

6379
02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:28.930

02:52:57.290 --> 02:52:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Break his elbow.</v>

6437
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:59.503
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

6438
02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:02.170
<v Speaker 3>And Roy comes back with an elbow his own again.</v>

6439
02:53:02.390 --> 02:53:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett is in crazy shape.</v>

6440
02:53:08.830 --> 02:53:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Josh,</v>

6441
02:53:11.530 --> 02:53:14.060
<v Speaker 3>this is Joshua for leg.</v>

6442
02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Does he roll down his style?</v>

6443
02:53:16.491 --> 02:53:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Catch wrestling?</v>

6444
02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:17.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6445
02:53:17.361 --> 02:53:18.320
<v Speaker 3>He'll try to roll for a leg.</v>

6446
02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:19.340
<v Speaker 3>If he got his leg in between.</v>

6447
02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:21.590
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

6448
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:22.850
<v Speaker 3>But if he gets his leg in between them,</v>

6449
02:53:22.851 --> 02:53:23.870
<v Speaker 3>he will drop and roll.</v>

6450
02:53:25.730 --> 02:53:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Rolling,</v>

6451
02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:26.953
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6452
02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

6453
02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:28.780
<v Speaker 3>He's going for that Kimora.</v>

6454
02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Use it to stand up.</v>

6455
02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:31.093
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

6456
02:53:31.650 --> 02:53:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Can make steroid defend it and then stands up.</v>

6457
02:53:34.341 --> 02:53:35.061
<v Speaker 3>Goes to the defense,</v>

6458
02:53:35.061 --> 02:53:35.894
<v Speaker 3>turns around.</v>

6459
02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:37.843
<v Speaker 3>Smart man.</v>

6460
02:53:37.850 --> 02:53:38.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a great fight,</v>

6461
02:53:38.931 --> 02:53:39.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6462
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:40.790
<v Speaker 3>It was a great fight.</v>

6463
02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:42.540
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6464
02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see Barnett vs Arlovski.</v>

6465
02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:47.480
<v Speaker 3>That'd be really good at.</v>

6466
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Around five is going to end right at three hours.</v>

6467
02:53:50.130 --> 02:53:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

6468
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Well just we'll restart it in between rounds.</v>

6469
02:53:55.460 --> 02:53:57.050
<v Speaker 3>We can't leave the people hanging here.</v>

6470
02:53:57.140 --> 02:53:59.570
<v Speaker 3>What if something crazy happens and we don't have it on film</v>

6471
02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:01.850
<v Speaker 3>after this round.</v>

6472
02:54:01.850 --> 02:54:02.900
<v Speaker 3>You have to start?</v>

6473
02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:03.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6474
02:54:03.291 --> 02:54:07.580
<v Speaker 3>because we're at three hours because the fight is going over because I guess no</v>

6475
02:54:07.581 --> 02:54:09.650
<v Speaker 3>one thought that the fights would go that long,</v>

6476
02:54:09.651 --> 02:54:10.640
<v Speaker 3>but how would that possible?</v>

6477
02:54:10.641 --> 02:54:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Because our block.</v>

6478
02:54:12.501 --> 02:54:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they do and nothing's a stream or something,</v>

6479
02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:17.450
<v Speaker 3>but all the funds went to decision except for Uriah though,</v>

6480
02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:18.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6481
02:54:18.270 --> 02:54:19.430
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what it is.</v>

6482
02:54:21.770 --> 02:54:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

6483
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:23.690
<v Speaker 3>This is a great fight.</v>

6484
02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I like Josh to southpaw style too with that fucking left kick.</v>

6485
02:54:27.471 --> 02:54:28.304
<v Speaker 3>He keeps around.</v>

6486
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Seems like Josh is definitely a factor.</v>

6487
02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:32.073
<v Speaker 3>Corsi is.</v>

6488
02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:32.953
<v Speaker 3>How could he not?</v>

6489
02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Roy is too though.</v>

6490
02:54:34.071 --> 02:54:34.904
<v Speaker 3>Look at both of them.</v>

6491
02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Josh had position position.</v>

6492
02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:38.533
<v Speaker 3>C'Mon.</v>

6493
02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:40.010
<v Speaker 3>That's exhausting.</v>

6494
02:54:40.330 --> 02:54:41.163
<v Speaker 3>It's exhausting.</v>

6495
02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Every time he's adjusting stays on.</v>

6496
02:54:43.731 --> 02:54:45.080
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to pull off a technique,</v>

6497
02:54:45.081 --> 02:54:46.820
<v Speaker 3>a counter technique when you've got someone's head up.</v>

6498
02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Tell you what,</v>

6499
02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:47.540
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

6500
02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:51.050
<v Speaker 3>both these guys have been in there with just the best of the best thing about</v>

6501
02:54:51.051 --> 02:54:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Roy's fights in the UFC.</v>

6502
02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:53.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6503
02:54:53.001 --> 02:54:54.810
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about experience wise,</v>

6504
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:59.830
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you give Barnett the edge seen on 100 percent went missing from his</v>

6505
02:55:00.201 --> 02:55:00.561
<v Speaker 3>resume.</v>

6506
02:55:00.561 --> 02:55:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Was fader true?</v>

6507
02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:02.610
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

6508
02:55:02.610 --> 02:55:03.443
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

6509
02:55:04.810 --> 02:55:05.360
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

6510
02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:06.980
<v Speaker 4>if you go to UFC experience,</v>

6511
02:55:06.981 --> 02:55:08.260
<v Speaker 4>it's Roy far.</v>

6512
02:55:08.350 --> 02:55:09.183
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

6513
02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:09.800
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

6514
02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:10.370
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

6515
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:11.050
<v Speaker 4>Did he hit him low?</v>

6516
02:55:11.050 --> 02:55:11.631
<v Speaker 4>Hit in the nuts.</v>

6517
02:55:11.631 --> 02:55:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Get that restaurant right at the bells.</v>

6518
02:55:13.430 --> 02:55:14.263
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the rail.</v>

6519
02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:15.853
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

6520
02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:17.413
<v Speaker 4>Let's see this.</v>

6521
02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:18.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>

6522
02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:19.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

6523
02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:20.091
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6524
02:55:20.091 --> 02:55:20.690
<v Speaker 4>that's the gut.</v>

6525
02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:20.931
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6526
02:55:20.931 --> 02:55:21.441
<v Speaker 4>hold up.</v>

6527
02:55:21.441 --> 02:55:22.041
<v Speaker 4>Hold up.</v>

6528
02:55:22.041 --> 02:55:22.874
<v Speaker 4>Let's see if he gets.</v>

6529
02:55:23.170 --> 02:55:24.550
<v Speaker 4>This is just the beat down.</v>

6530
02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

6531
02:55:25.881 --> 02:55:27.260
<v Speaker 4>These are awesome combinations.</v>

6532
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:29.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a vicious uppercut bro.</v>

6533
02:55:29.031 --> 02:55:32.240
<v Speaker 4>You know who roy fought after he got knocked out by hunt over it.</v>

6534
02:55:32.270 --> 02:55:33.051
<v Speaker 4>Right to her leg lock.</v>

6535
02:55:33.051 --> 02:55:33.471
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6536
02:55:33.471 --> 02:55:34.221
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

6537
02:55:34.221 --> 02:55:34.681
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

6538
02:55:34.681 --> 02:55:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Right foot over him.</v>

6539
02:55:35.570 --> 02:55:36.670
<v Speaker 4>That was in last fight.</v>

6540
02:55:36.850 --> 02:55:38.150
<v Speaker 4>It was a good fight over him.</v>

6541
02:55:38.151 --> 02:55:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Had to stay the fuck away from him.</v>

6542
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6543
02:55:40.210 --> 02:55:41.590
<v Speaker 4>And Roy knocked him down once,</v>

6544
02:55:42.290 --> 02:55:44.030
<v Speaker 4>overcomes the jds next.</v>

6545
02:55:44.050 --> 02:55:44.883
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

6546
02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:50.300
<v Speaker 4>What a fight that's going to be holy shit been for when you want to see overeem</v>

6547
02:55:50.361 --> 02:55:51.260
<v Speaker 4>versus Barnett.</v>

6548
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:52.700
<v Speaker 4>I would love that.</v>

6549
02:55:52.700 --> 02:55:54.410
<v Speaker 4>That would be fucking interesting.</v>

6550
02:55:54.470 --> 02:55:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Super interesting.</v>

6551
02:55:55.400 --> 02:55:57.200
<v Speaker 4>That might be that fight.</v>

6552
02:55:57.410 --> 02:55:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I just think he's tougher.</v>

6553
02:55:58.930 --> 02:56:00.750
<v Speaker 4>I'd never find each other and pride her.</v>

6554
02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

6555
02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.320
<v Speaker 4>That'll be a great fucking fight,</v>

6556
02:56:03.321 --> 02:56:03.560
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6557
02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:06.140
<v Speaker 4>I think Barnett [inaudible] Barnett Overeem,</v>

6558
02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:09.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of guys for fuck</v>

6559
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:12.040
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight,</v>

6560
02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.340
<v Speaker 4>the easiest job to make fights jds and over him.</v>

6561
02:56:15.341 --> 02:56:16.440
<v Speaker 4>He's a great fight though and there.</v>

6562
02:56:16.441 --> 02:56:18.890
<v Speaker 4>There's been a lot of shit talking over the year and hate each other.</v>

6563
02:56:18.891 --> 02:56:19.724
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

6564
02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6565
02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:20.481
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

6566
02:56:20.481 --> 02:56:20.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6567
02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a good time because over Ian's got some confidence now.</v>

6568
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:25.160
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

6569
02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:25.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

6570
02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:26.151
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6571
02:56:26.151 --> 02:56:28.940
<v Speaker 4>I think so because jds has had some trouble.</v>

6572
02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:32.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a good time for the body by Barnett.</v>

6573
02:56:34.810 --> 02:56:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a good time for overeem.</v>

6574
02:56:36.261 --> 02:56:37.610
<v Speaker 4>It's bad for JDF.</v>

6575
02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:38.473
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>

6576
02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:40.280
<v Speaker 4>And I think that if it was earlier,</v>

6577
02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:43.790
<v Speaker 4>it would have been a good time for jds and a bad time for ovary.</v>

6578
02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:44.673
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

6579
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Josh Barnett pouring it on.</v>

6580

6581
02:56:47.151 --> 02:56:51.440

6587
02:57:03.891 --> 02:57:04.560
<v Speaker 4>They would have called me.</v>

6588
02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:04.881

6593
02:57:07.671 --> 02:57:08.121
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

6594
02:57:08.121 --> 02:57:08.900

6595
02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:13.900
<v Speaker 4>Yo Stop feeling that overeem the 265 pounds shredded overeem regardless of</v>

6596
02:57:17.151 --> 02:57:19.280
<v Speaker 4>substances that enhance that position.</v>

6597
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:21.170
<v Speaker 4>That motherfucker was terrifying.</v>

6598
02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:22.280
<v Speaker 4>So that guy,</v>

6599
02:57:22.530 --> 02:57:24.830
<v Speaker 4>I like him over,</v>

6600
02:57:24.831 --> 02:57:25.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6601
02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:28.190
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people maybe even over junior dos Santos,</v>

6602
02:57:28.191 --> 02:57:28.851
<v Speaker 4>but bro,</v>

6603
02:57:28.851 --> 02:57:30.020
<v Speaker 4>I like Kim over judo.</v>

6604
02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Sentos and cane at the same time.</v>

6605
02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:34.033
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

6606
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:35.750
<v Speaker 4>that guy was on another note.</v>

6607
02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:36.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know though.</v>

6608
02:57:36.651 --> 02:57:39.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he will be able to do that to Cain in that fight.</v>

6609
02:57:39.441 --> 02:57:39.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6610
02:57:39.681 --> 02:57:40.760
<v Speaker 4>what would he have been able to keep?</v>

6611
02:57:40.761 --> 02:57:41.271
<v Speaker 4>What you got to think?</v>

6612
02:57:41.271 --> 02:57:41.661
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

6613
02:57:41.661 --> 02:57:42.800
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at their results,</v>

6614
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:45.110
<v Speaker 4>but we're not thinking about the players because Josh,</v>

6615
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:47.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm A.</v>

6616
02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Brock Lesnar was coming off a stomach surgery,</v>

6617
02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:49.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

6618
02:57:49.310 --> 02:57:50.800
<v Speaker 4>12 inches on the homeland.</v>

6619
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:53.260
<v Speaker 4>Robert was touching him and just fuck it.</v>

6620
02:57:53.270 --> 02:57:54.103
<v Speaker 4>Looked like it hurt.</v>

6621
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6622
02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:55.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6623
02:57:55.161 --> 02:57:55.450
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

6624
02:57:55.450 --> 02:57:56.420
<v Speaker 4>overeem's terrifying.</v>

6625
02:57:56.450 --> 02:57:57.910
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about this.</v>

6626
02:57:58.010 --> 02:57:59.690
<v Speaker 4>This new room is not as terrifying.</v>

6627
02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6628
02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:01.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same guy,</v>

6629
02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:02.130
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

6630
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean physically,</v>

6631
02:58:03.330 --> 02:58:03.601
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6632
02:58:03.601 --> 02:58:04.320
<v Speaker 2>not even close,</v>

6633
02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know how much of that fight was over him and how much of it was.</v>

6634
02:58:08.491 --> 02:58:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Brock lesnar really should have been fighting.</v>

6635
02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

6636
02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:10.740
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

6637
02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:12.210
<v Speaker 2>what MMA legend.</v>

6638
02:58:12.211 --> 02:58:17.211
<v Speaker 2>You have surgeon did a valentine over and beat randy couture.</v>

6639
02:58:17.490 --> 02:58:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

6640
02:58:18.180 --> 02:58:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Hold up.</v>

6641
02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:20.880
<v Speaker 2>He beat a Valentine beat.</v>

6642
02:58:21.650 --> 02:58:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Her.</v>

6643
02:58:21.810 --> 02:58:22.643
<v Speaker 2>Joe Said,</v>

6644
02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:23.950
<v Speaker 2>don't act like you're just,</v>

6645
02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you're just said red.</v>

6646
02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:28.110
<v Speaker 2>He gets named Randy cookie tapped,</v>

6647
02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but he never fought in the UFC.</v>

6648
02:58:30.721 --> 02:58:32.310
<v Speaker 2>He also beat Ray Sefo,</v>

6649
02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:33.451
<v Speaker 2>which is old school,</v>

6650
02:58:33.451 --> 02:58:34.930
<v Speaker 2>but he got him in a neck.</v>

6651
02:58:34.931 --> 02:58:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

6652
02:58:35.250 --> 02:58:35.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6653
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:38.610
<v Speaker 2>But raise more of a [inaudible] legend that he is a UFC legend.</v>

6654
02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:38.790

<v Speaker 2>He does have a more,</v>

6675
02:59:15.850 --> 02:59:16.830
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have the legs.</v>

6676
02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:17.693

<v Speaker 2>That promoter is not going to be shit.</v>

6679
02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be hard to josh by Nick.</v>

6680
02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:24.973

6694
02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Or He'd want to still fight him.</v>

03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 50 something right.</v>

6725
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.691
<v Speaker 2>Ken.</v>

6726
03:00:33.691 --> 03:00:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Shamrock shredded.</v>

6727
03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:38.490
<v Speaker 2>But if someone comes back and he's at his old skill level,</v>

6728
03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:40.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible mismatch.</v>

6729
03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a big if bro.</v>

6730
03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6731
03:00:43.291 --> 03:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>if they're letting them fight in Japan,</v>

6732
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>if Japan doesn't have any,</v>

6733
03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:48.120
<v Speaker 2>we're not saying I just want to get right out of the way.</v>

6734
03:00:48.210 --> 03:00:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't accuse me of accusing him of juicing,</v>

6735
03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say.</v>

6736
03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say we go back to the vandelay.</v>

6737
03:00:57.530 --> 03:00:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Kelly's Roy.</v>

6738
03:00:59.750 --> 03:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Go for</v>

6739
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:01.053
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

6740
03:01:01.270 --> 03:01:02.103
<v Speaker 3>Going for it.</v>

6741
03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:03.160
<v Speaker 3>He is going for it.</v>

6742
03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

6743
03:01:03.910 --> 03:01:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen seconds.</v>

6744
03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

6745
03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:07.151
<v Speaker 3>Nice Combo.</v>

6746
03:01:07.151 --> 03:01:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Josh looked up at the clock 12 seconds ago.</v>

6747
03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:12.193
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6748
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:14.720
<v Speaker 3>it was a hard shot to the forearm.</v>

6749
03:01:14.780 --> 03:01:15.613
<v Speaker 3>A side kick.</v>

6750
03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Damn shot.</v>

6751
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:20.830
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking fight and fight.</v>

6752
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.863
<v Speaker 3>Dan.</v>

6753
03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Did we make it out of three hours?</v>

6754
03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:25.780
<v Speaker 3>We're always three.</v>

6755
03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

6756
03:01:26.330 --> 03:01:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Other trucker a Barnett by decision,</v>

6757
03:01:29.771 --> 03:01:30.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6758
03:01:30.930 --> 03:01:32.930
<v Speaker 3>So most likely never to.</v>

6759
03:01:33.010 --> 03:01:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I bet they give to them three to never know.</v>

6760
03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:35.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6761
03:01:35.801 --> 03:01:39.610
<v Speaker 3>we've seen crazier shit take downs in Japan.</v>

6762
03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:40.091
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

6763
03:01:40.091 --> 03:01:40.840
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>

6764
03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

6765
03:01:41.770 --> 03:01:42.603
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

6766
03:01:42.610 --> 03:01:43.720
<v Speaker 3>What a great fight.</v>

6767
03:01:44.530 --> 03:01:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you one thing.</v>

6768
03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:46.091
<v Speaker 3>Unquestionably,</v>

6769
03:01:46.091 --> 03:01:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett looked as good as he's ever looked like.</v>

6770
03:01:49.390 --> 03:01:49.661
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

6771
03:01:49.661 --> 03:01:51.160
<v Speaker 3>his physical shape,</v>

6772
03:01:51.780 --> 03:01:53.900
<v Speaker 3>like the combination is the best one.</v>

6773
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Was the tune a long time.</v>

6774
03:01:55.451 --> 03:01:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Roy was way more prepared than his body would let you think.</v>

6775
03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:00.573
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6776
03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean he obviously went five,</v>

6777
03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:04.630
<v Speaker 3>never judged by her,</v>

6778
03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:06.340
<v Speaker 3>hurt them in the fifth round.</v>

6779
03:02:06.490 --> 03:02:06.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6780
03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:08.830
<v Speaker 3>he still had power in the fifth and final round.</v>

6781
03:02:08.831 --> 03:02:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Come down four times.</v>

6782
03:02:09.901 --> 03:02:14.901
<v Speaker 3>It took them 10 times and took him down to fifth and hurt him in the fifth to</v>

6783
03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:16.073
<v Speaker 3>banged them.</v>

6784
03:02:16.810 --> 03:02:18.640
<v Speaker 3>I think he hates him.</v>

6785
03:02:18.641 --> 03:02:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Hard fucking kicks to his arms to match.</v>

6786
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:21.580
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like Roy,</v>

6787
03:02:21.581 --> 03:02:23.560
<v Speaker 3>he's won one his last five.</v>

6788
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:24.423
<v Speaker 3>What do you do with that?</v>

6789
03:02:24.970 --> 03:02:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Never let that guy go.</v>

6790
03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:27.580
<v Speaker 3>He's always fun.</v>

6791
03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:29.110
<v Speaker 3>He's always fun to watch,</v>

6792
03:02:29.130 --> 03:02:29.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6793
03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Can't let that guy go.</v>

6794
03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:30.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6795
03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying if your Roy Roy is hard.</v>

6796
03:02:35.531 --> 03:02:36.221
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

6797
03:02:36.221 --> 03:02:36.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6798
03:02:36.730 --> 03:02:37.563
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

6799
03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:41.470
<v Speaker 3>what he needs to do is what Josh just showed he needs to get in some serious</v>

6800
03:02:41.490 --> 03:02:42.323
<v Speaker 3>defining themselves.</v>

6801
03:02:42.330 --> 03:02:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Will take some time off.</v>

6802
03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:44.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6803
03:02:44.171 --> 03:02:44.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6804
03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:44.861
<v Speaker 3>get me.</v>

6805
03:02:44.861 --> 03:02:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Look how much better Josh looked with a Dietitian.</v>

6806
03:02:47.441 --> 03:02:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6807
03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's a guy who trains with.</v>

6808
03:02:49.420 --> 03:02:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Is a guy who's a prescribed as diet for him who's monitoring has died for him.</v>

6809
03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:55.480
<v Speaker 3>But look how God Damn Goodie look.</v>

6810
03:02:55.660 --> 03:02:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Five hard rounds.</v>

6811
03:02:56.711 --> 03:02:59.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll bomber like Roy Nelson.</v>

6812
03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Scrap scrap.</v>

6813
03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6814
03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:04.930
<v Speaker 3>And Josh looked great in the fifth and final round.</v>

6815
03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:06.460
<v Speaker 3>They still had real good.</v>

6816
03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:07.680
<v Speaker 3>They both looked amazing.</v>

6817
03:03:08.530 --> 03:03:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Pouring it on at the end.</v>

6818
03:03:10.050 --> 03:03:10.883
<v Speaker 3>Sure as fuck was.</v>

6819
03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:13.750
<v Speaker 3>But now let's imagine if Roy had done the same thing that Josh did.</v>

6820
03:03:13.751 --> 03:03:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Would Roy won that fight?</v>

6821
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.731
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

6822
03:03:15.731 --> 03:03:16.300
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

6823
03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>if Roy had did the same thing that Josh Day as far as monitoring his diet,</v>

6824
03:03:19.420 --> 03:03:22.630
<v Speaker 3>but it could still hit that fucking hard and lost the body fat,</v>

6825
03:03:22.631 --> 03:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>had more gas in his tank,</v>

6826
03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:27.340
<v Speaker 3>was able to pour it on more will disable the counter more off the cage.</v>

6827
03:03:27.341 --> 03:03:29.950
<v Speaker 3>The difference in this really wasn't really striking was that it was this</v>

6828
03:03:30.010 --> 03:03:30.520
<v Speaker 3>takedowns.</v>

6829
03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:31.121
<v Speaker 3>His grappling.</v>

6830
03:03:31.121 --> 03:03:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

6831
03:03:31.330 --> 03:03:35.320
<v Speaker 3>let's say he loses weight so there's taking pitches down and not losing the</v>

6832
03:03:35.321 --> 03:03:37.110
<v Speaker 3>position because of scrambled eggs like,</v>

6833
03:03:37.130 --> 03:03:37.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6834
03:03:37.311 --> 03:03:37.671
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

6835
03:03:37.671 --> 03:03:39.190
<v Speaker 3>not conserving his gas tank.</v>

6836
03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Tremendous shape.</v>

6837
03:03:40.751 --> 03:03:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Let's say.</v>

6838
03:03:41.410 --> 03:03:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Let's say he got down to one 85.</v>

6839
03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine how good his Jujitsu would look?</v>

6840
03:03:45.850 --> 03:03:46.331
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

6841
03:03:46.331 --> 03:03:47.164
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

6842
03:03:47.490 --> 03:03:47.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6843
03:03:47.771 --> 03:03:48.161
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

6844
03:03:48.161 --> 03:03:48.671
<v Speaker 3>One 85.</v>

6845
03:03:48.671 --> 03:03:50.080
<v Speaker 3>We were kind of talking crazy.</v>

6846
03:03:50.081 --> 03:03:53.480
<v Speaker 3>We really want to lose 85 pounds.</v>

6847
03:03:53.530 --> 03:03:54.700
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a different case.</v>

6848
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:55.601
<v Speaker 3>He's a big guy.</v>

03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Warm master.</v>

6874

<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

6875
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:29.660
<v Speaker 2>He's not even breathing heavy.</v>

6876
03:04:29.810 --> 03:04:30.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean he's tired for sure.</v>

6878
03:04:31.430 --> 03:04:33.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a hell of a fucking hell of a fight.</v>

6879
03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>She's a hell of a fight.</v>

6880
03:04:35.230 --> 03:04:36.650
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Josh Barnett.</v>

6881
03:04:36.890 --> 03:04:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if you say some crazy progress on shit.</v>

6882
03:04:39.230 --> 03:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Crank that shit up because sometimes he says crazy progress and show usually.</v>

6883
03:04:43.071 --> 03:04:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Good boy.</v>

6884
03:04:44.830 --> 03:04:45.860
<v Speaker 2>He picked me up once.</v>

6885
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a pillow after the fight.</v>

6886
03:04:48.231 --> 03:04:49.910
<v Speaker 2>He was still jazzed up after the,</v>

6887
03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:50.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6888
03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir fight.</v>

6889
03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:54.400
<v Speaker 2>He hoisted me up in the air like a throat,</v>

6890
03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:57.021
<v Speaker 2>like a star.</v>

6891
03:04:57.021 --> 03:04:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Like a welcome mat was welcoming.</v>

6892
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:04.730
<v Speaker 2>But I felt like Josh should have said Satanic Tattoo.</v>

6893
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:06.230
<v Speaker 2>It's going to talk in Japanese.</v>

6894
03:05:07.310 --> 03:05:08.143
<v Speaker 2>He talks Japanese.</v>

6895
03:05:13.680 --> 03:05:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's where the money comes in.</v>

6896
03:05:15.420 --> 03:05:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They love him over there,</v>

6903
03:05:27.250 --> 03:05:29.450
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to be such an unusual dude.</v>

6904
03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:29.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6905
03:05:29.661 --> 03:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird guy.</v>

6906
03:05:33.020 --> 03:05:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I respect the fuck out of that guy though.</v>

6907
03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm am not going to hang out with them,</v>

6908
03:05:36.711 --> 03:05:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but for sure you wouldn't hang out with him.</v>

6909
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:39.111
<v Speaker 2>I probably would.</v>

6910
03:05:39.111 --> 03:05:40.010
<v Speaker 2>We're just so different,</v>

03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.661
<v Speaker 2>You would love him.</v>

6914
03:05:41.661 --> 03:05:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

6915
03:05:42.050 --> 03:05:42.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6916
03:05:42.201 --> 03:05:43.034
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

6917
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Josh Barnett as a person.</v>

6918
03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I like hanging out with them.</v>

6919
03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I love having him on the podcast.</v>

6920
03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:48.950
<v Speaker 2>He's great on your podcast.</v>

6921
03:05:48.980 --> 03:05:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Smart motherfucker.</v>

03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:53.040
<v Speaker 2>As smart and as well read and as you know,</v>

6924
03:05:53.050 --> 03:05:55.580
<v Speaker 2>is nuanced in his thinking as a,</v>

6925
03:05:55.581 --> 03:05:56.420
<v Speaker 2>as anybody I know.</v>

6926
03:05:56.600 --> 03:05:58.470
<v Speaker 2>And he's a professional fighter at the highest level.</v>

6927
03:05:59.020 --> 03:05:59.870
<v Speaker 6>Nothing I didn't hear.</v>

6928
03:05:59.871 --> 03:06:02.070
<v Speaker 6>It was good enough that I.</v>

6929
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.090
<v Speaker 6>Nothing</v>

6930
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I did in here was good enough tonight.</v>

6931
03:06:03.540 --> 03:06:04.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking monster.</v>

6932
03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:05.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6933
03:06:05.281 --> 03:06:06.840
<v Speaker 2>he's on a fucking bender right now.</v>

6934
03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Or that's not the right word.</v>

6935
03:06:08.610 --> 03:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Bender vendors for drinking.</v>

6936
03:06:10.590 --> 03:06:11.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6937
03:06:11.610 --> 03:06:13.020
<v Speaker 2>he's on a run is what I meant to say.</v>

6938
03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6939
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:14.860
<v Speaker 2>he's doing well.</v>

6940
03:06:14.861 --> 03:06:15.694
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like to say.</v>

6941
03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:17.100
<v Speaker 2>He's not a real bender,</v>

6942
03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:18.940
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

6943
03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Mouth Insert foot.</v>

6944
03:06:21.990 --> 03:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>It would be one thing if I didn't do this.</v>

6945
03:06:23.560 --> 03:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>He's looking at Josh Barnett.</v>

6946
03:06:24.810 --> 03:06:25.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6947
03:06:25.321 --> 03:06:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Are you looking at eyes and said</v>

6948
03:06:32.130 --> 03:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>he's like Godzilla fro,</v>

6949
03:06:35.240 --> 03:06:36.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6950
03:06:36.340 --> 03:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>rampage destroys in Japan.</v>

6951
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Deal Destroys Asians in America.</v>

6952
03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:41.910
<v Speaker 2>How dare you bring it up.</v>

6953
03:06:41.950 --> 03:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Holly's not here to defend himself.</v>

6954
03:06:44.170 --> 03:06:44.970
<v Speaker 2>He likes,</v>

6955
03:06:44.970 --> 03:06:45.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6956
03:06:45.241 --> 03:06:47.160
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about having rampage fight rumble.</v>

6957
03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that?</v>

6958
03:06:51.090 --> 03:06:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard Shogun?</v>

6959
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:55.423
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

6960
03:06:55.510 --> 03:06:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Or is Dan Shogun?</v>

6961
03:06:56.670 --> 03:06:57.570
<v Speaker 4>It's Dan Shogun.</v>

6962
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>Shogun just had shoulder surgery.</v>

6963
03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:00.600
<v Speaker 4>He's been in a sling,</v>

6964
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:05.220
<v Speaker 4>like his arm has been a back training as he was in a sling like really recently.</v>

6965
03:07:05.221 --> 03:07:06.054
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

6966
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:09.320
<v Speaker 4>Like really recently there was photos of him I think on instagram or something</v>

6967
03:07:09.321 --> 03:07:10.290
<v Speaker 4>like that of him in a sling.</v>

6968
03:07:10.530 --> 03:07:12.220
<v Speaker 4>I read Shogun.</v>

6969
03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:13.020
<v Speaker 4>That's what I heard.</v>

6970
03:07:13.020 --> 03:07:14.390
<v Speaker 4>I'd be crazy for the next fight.</v>

6971
03:07:14.490 --> 03:07:15.390
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy fight.</v>

6972
03:07:15.391 --> 03:07:17.730
<v Speaker 4>But if shogun did have shoulder surgery,</v>

6973
03:07:17.970 --> 03:07:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what surgery had or why rampage I,</v>

6974
03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:21.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6975
03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:25.080
<v Speaker 4>I might be making this up because I'm assuming it was a shoulder thing because</v>

6976
03:07:25.081 --> 03:07:26.640
<v Speaker 4>he had his arm in a sling.</v>

6977
03:07:26.910 --> 03:07:27.690
<v Speaker 4>He have just,</v>

6978
03:07:27.690 --> 03:07:30.420
<v Speaker 4>it could've been something as simple as like bone spurs in his elbow,</v>

6979
03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:31.800
<v Speaker 4>which is a quick turnaround.</v>

6980
03:07:34.290 --> 03:07:35.460
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys do.</v>

6981
03:07:35.490 --> 03:07:36.070
<v Speaker 4>What does he say?</v>

6982
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.660
<v Speaker 4>Surgery.</v>

6983
03:07:36.660 --> 03:07:37.350
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>

6984
03:07:37.350 --> 03:07:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Early 2016 return.</v>

6985
03:07:38.850 --> 03:07:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6986
03:07:39.390 --> 03:07:40.890
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably shoulder.</v>

6987
03:07:41.100 --> 03:07:41.581
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>

6988
03:07:41.581 --> 03:07:43.950
<v Speaker 4>Does it say what kind of shirt show what kind of surgery?</v>

6989
03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Young Jamie Shoulder.</v>

6990
03:07:48.650 --> 03:07:49.483
<v Speaker 4>Shoulder,</v>

6991
03:07:49.650 --> 03:07:50.483
<v Speaker 4>shoulder surgery.</v>

6992
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:52.410
<v Speaker 4>See Shit.</v>

6993
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6994
03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:53.460
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

6995
03:07:53.460 --> 03:07:53.820
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

6996
03:07:53.820 --> 03:07:55.230
<v Speaker 4>I did hear shogun rampage.</v>

6997
03:07:55.740 --> 03:07:56.573
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6998
03:07:56.730 --> 03:07:58.560
<v Speaker 4>so from a reliable source,</v>

6999
03:07:58.620 --> 03:08:02.250
<v Speaker 4>well now shogun is not gonna be able to fight until 2016.</v>

7000
03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:03.750
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what they'll do because.</v>

7001
03:08:03.990 --> 03:08:04.141
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

7002
03:08:04.141 --> 03:08:04.740
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

7003
03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Last blight crime,</v>

7004
03:08:05.851 --> 03:08:06.270
<v Speaker 4>Sun.</v>

7005
03:08:06.270 --> 03:08:09.280
<v Speaker 4>But most of the fights up until December already accounted for anyway.</v>

7006
03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Especially the big end of January already accounted for anyway.</v>

7007
03:08:12.601 --> 03:08:13.650
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that is the fight,</v>

7008
03:08:14.220 --> 03:08:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but rumble,</v>

7009
03:08:15.570 --> 03:08:18.610
<v Speaker 4>rumble versus rampage will be crazy for as long as it lasts.</v>

7010
03:08:19.350 --> 03:08:20.340
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy fight.</v>

7011
