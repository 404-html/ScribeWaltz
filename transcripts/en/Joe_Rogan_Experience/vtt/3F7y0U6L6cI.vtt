00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 1>This is how we begin.</v>

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Ready,</v>

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

5
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 1>The first part of the podcast is not required listening.</v>

7
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially commercials,</v>

8
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally it becomes entertaining.</v>

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.671
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

10
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>sometimes more entertaining than the actual podcast itself.</v>

11
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>This is disturbing.</v>

12
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And as we're winging this entire thing and have no real program for how it's</v>

13
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>supposed to run a,</v>

14
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what to say when that happens.</v>

15
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.203
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're brought to you by a bunch of things.</v>

30
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>but everything we're brought to you by,</v>

32
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>we believe in that is our own 100% pledge.</v>

33
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to tell you dawg shit,</v>

34
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to sell you something that's not good.</v>

35
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>We've been offered a lot of different things that we didn't agree with that</v>

36
00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>neither Brian nor I thought were interesting or just,</v>

37
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:02.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>stuff that,</v>

39
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

40
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't seem like it was something that we should be endorsing.</v>

41
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're trying to do.</v>

42
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to only endorse shit we would use and stuff we believe in.</v>

43
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And this kerosene games is a brand new startup and they have games that they're</v>

44
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:22.921
<v Speaker 1>developing specifically for iPads and four I iPhones and high end android</v>

45
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>devices starting in February.</v>

46
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And what what it is is a lot of the games like especially like really high end,</v>

47
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>big beautiful games,</v>

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them there,</v>

49
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>they start out making him for consoles or they started out making them for a PC</v>

50
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and then they poured it over to an iPad.</v>

51
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>That's not what these guys do.</v>

52
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>What these guys do is they make bad ass games right out of the box for iPods and</v>

53
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>touchscreen devices.</v>

58
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.290

59
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and designed for use with an iPad.</v>

60
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't feel clunky at all.</v>

61
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>The graphics are fucking awesome.</v>

62
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a really cool game and I've gotten nothing but positive feedback from</v>

63
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>people that went out and bought it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's really cheap to 99.</v>

66
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they say to you 99 not three bucks.</v>

67
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.173

69
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to save a penny of fuck.</v>

70
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.500

79
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:41.021

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

84
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they call him a cowboy because there's no fucking couch.</v>

85
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I guess I used to do is wear that hat and you're a cowboy.</v>

86
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 2>This motherfuckers never seen a cow in his life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How he got this guys,</v>

88
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.660
<v Speaker 2>the last thing from a cowboy,</v>

89
00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what a cowboy is?</v>

90
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy is a guy who has to take these cows and move them in a certain direction.</v>

91
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>It's the most boring ass fucking life ever.</v>

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 2>He just run it around pushing cows.</v>

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:12.930
<v Speaker 2>That sort of real cowboy does.</v>

94
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally you have to last a one and it's a big day.</v>

95
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.780
<v Speaker 3>So when you were playing cowboys and Indians as a kid,</v>

96
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.340
<v Speaker 3>he does lassoed cows and stuff.</v>

97
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.731

00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I never understood that.</v>

101
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Stanwood cowboys really worth that.</v>

102
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.250
<v Speaker 2>The cowboys were like always fighting Indians in some sort of a fucking,</v>

103
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.460
<v Speaker 2>a Hatfield versus the McCoy sort of a way.</v>

105
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really understand what a cowboy was.</v>

106
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I was young when I did this,</v>

107
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.840
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

108
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.340

<v Speaker 2>The game is played slinger and it's only three bucks.</v>

112
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 3>The Fox and iPad eight inch is one of the coolest things in the road and playing</v>

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:46.380
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

115
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>it's so much better than a GameBoy nowadays.</v>

116
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like a game boy that's also a computer.</v>

117
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

118
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

119
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:52.830

120
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

122
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

123
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I thought the tablets were stupid as fuck when they first came out.</v>

124
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.371
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

125
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

126
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 2>but they're so convenient.</v>

127
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>

128
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing how much you can store on them.</v>

129
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

130
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that hey,</v>

131
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.580
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

132
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.951
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

133
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:06.611
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing there?</v>

134
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:06.941
<v Speaker 2>Fell out.</v>

135
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:07.774
<v Speaker 2>It was very real.</v>

136
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

137
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if it's real,</v>

138
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 2>the tits.</v>

139
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's of your tits,</v>

140
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>we can get in trouble.</v>

141
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>It's art.</v>

142
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.391
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

143
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Painting is painting of tests.</v>

144
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I still think we can get in trouble.</v>

145
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

146

206
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 2>do with cognitive function.</v>

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 2>What kind of nonsense is this?</v>

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of stink.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Remember when people were selling those hologram bracelets?</v>

216
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

217

<v Speaker 2>and I love the people that's still wear them in Vegas.</v>

218
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>This chick was telling me that they took the real technology from that bracelet</v>

219
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and they incorporate into their own,</v>

220
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.521
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

221
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>that that bracelet was ripping people off.</v>

222
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>But this shit works.</v>

223

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.030

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Like what's it called?</v>

229
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 2>W what are you calling it?</v>

230
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.491
<v Speaker 2>What do you call it?</v>

231
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>You got a piece of plastic on your wrist if you believe it.</v>

232
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>It makes you feel better.</v>

233
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>A lot of how you feel is affected by your attitude a lot.</v>

234
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you truly feel like you've been gifted with this fucking rubber band</v>

235
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:39.351
<v Speaker 2>around your wrist,</v>

236
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.870
<v Speaker 2>that makes you move better,</v>

237
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start thinking like a person who moves better.</v>

238
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's a big part of what's fucked up about you.</v>

239
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.363
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

240
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Janet together bitches.</v>

241
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.091
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

242
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

243
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>in in that vein,</v>

244
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I would be very sensitive to anything that I thought was a placebo.</v>

245
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>The science behind Alpha brain is all rock solid.</v>

246
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>You can look it up,</v>

247
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:04.050
<v Speaker 2>you can look up all the different various ingredients and the history of,</v>

248
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 2>of human use of these ingredients,</v>

249
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 2>including things like memory tests.</v>

250
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:08.381
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

251
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:13.381
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit that people have learned about the efficacy of nootropics</v>

252
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.451
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

253
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

254
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

255
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 2>the weight of evidence clearly sides on the idea that vitamins and nutrients we</v>

256
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 2>know affect human performance.</v>

257
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.440
<v Speaker 2>We know they affect your body's ability to recover your body's ability to be,</v>

258
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>to be nourished in a way that allows it to move and function and operate at its</v>

259
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 2>optimum levels.</v>

260
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of supplementation.</v>

261
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a big fan of eating right.</v>

262
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the most important and underlooked things.</v>

263
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 2>People just don't get enough fucking vegetables in their diets and uh,</v>

264
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons we started selling these BLENDTEC blenders at [inaudible] dot</v>

265
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 2>com is for that very reason to try to encourage people like you want to really</v>

266
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.074
<v Speaker 2>be healthy,</v>

267
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 2>go to the supermarket as often as you can go three,</v>

268
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.101
<v Speaker 2>four times a week.</v>

269
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:09.101
<v Speaker 2>If you can get Kale and cucumbers and celery and garlic and,</v>

270
00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:09.771
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

271
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and get some sort of fruit like an apple so it doesn't taste like death.</v>

272
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Throw it in there with some coconut oil and rock that shit every morning.</v>

341
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

342
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.140
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of both going around,</v>

343
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:18.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

344
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bullshit folks,</v>

345
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.410
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

346
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's not all bullshit.</v>

347
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.893
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

348
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird shit out there in the world.</v>

349
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 2>And does that mean hope there?</v>

350
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

351
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

352
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I made a beep off my phone,</v>

353
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that almost immediately discount anything fringe,</v>

354
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 2>whether it's psychics or whether it's,</v>

355
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

356
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:39.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten angry people over the last couple of weeks,</v>

358
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.710
<v Speaker 2>like angry emails and angry tweets because I suggested that something might be</v>

359
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

360
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 2>When you think about someone and the phone calls,</v>

361
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>the phone rings and it's them and that people like,</v>

362
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:55.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

363
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 2>you're attaching that to it.</v>

364
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 2>This is a person you think about all day.</v>

365
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Like Sam Harris said some very logical points.</v>

366
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with him absolutely for the most part.</v>

367
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>But there are specific isolated instances where you feel something and then</v>

368
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>something happens where you know someone's looking at you.</v>

369
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:11.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

370
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

371
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 4>Remember at Sheldrake did a,</v>

372
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

373
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 4>a controlled study in which he had people list for people who were present in</v>

374
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:21.391
<v Speaker 4>their lives.</v>

375
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who might in fact call them.</v>

376
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 4>And then for,</v>

377
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 4>I forget how long a period it was,</v>

378
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 4>a week or two weeks,</v>

379
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:27.924
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

380
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

381
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.671
<v Speaker 4>they were supposed to,</v>

382
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 4>anytime the phone rang before they answered it,</v>

383
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 4>think of which of these four people it was.</v>

384
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

385
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 4>they thought of the correct person a more at a rate,</v>

386
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 4>higher than chance,</v>

387
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.220
<v Speaker 4>significantly higher than chance.</v>

388
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 4>And I don't have all those,</v>

389
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:45.831
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

390
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:46.171
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

391
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 4>the numbers in my head right now,</v>

392
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 4>but it ended up being as statistically significant fact.</v>

393
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.521
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

394
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 4>So instead of being a right when it was one of those four people,</v>

395
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 4>one out of four times,</v>

396
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 4>they were right far more often.</v>

397
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

398
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

399
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah,</v>

400
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 4>well there's that because they knew that this one motherfucker just calls me all</v>

401
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 4>the time and he's money in the bank.</v>

402
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to prove some psychics.</v>

403
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just one.</v>

404
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 4>What if one guy just fucking calls you all day and you're like,</v>

405
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 4>I know it's Marty and you pick it up and it's Marty because Marty calls you all</v>

406
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

407
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 4>I suppose it could be.</v>

408
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 4>It could be that they had,</v>

409
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.330
<v Speaker 4>they had so many people involved in the study that it would seem to be what it</v>

410
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:21.641
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

411
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 4>is statistically significant effect in writing a book though.</v>

412
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Do you start looking for fuckery and studies like that?</v>

413
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.500
<v Speaker 4>And because you know,</v>

414
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 4>of course your purpose initially was kind of did to disprove a lot of this</v>

415
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:31.990
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

416
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 4>And I have to tell you the chapter on telepathy in particular have scared the</v>

417
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 4>hell out of me because I had gotten so used to hearing this skeptical line.</v>

418
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:39.311
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence,</v>

419
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:39.851
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence,</v>

420
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:43.530
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that I really expected to find weapons.</v>

421
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.060
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

422
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

423
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 4>when I realized I was going to have to hang my ass out on the line and saying,</v>

424
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.301
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

425
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 4>there's actually some evidence.</v>

426
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.731
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

427
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 4>it was scary.</v>

428
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 4>That was scary.</v>

429
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Was it scary because you thought like intellectually you'd be criticized and</v>

430
00:12:57.851 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 4>you'd be marginalized.</v>

431
00:12:59.411 --> 00:12:59.861
<v Speaker 4>Shore.</v>

432
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 4>I thought it'd be ostracized within the profession of journalism,</v>

433
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

434
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.671
<v Speaker 4>for saying this.</v>

435
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is there's,</v>

436
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 4>there's a really high level debate going on between really smart people about</v>

437
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 4>the proper way to slice and dice these studies in terms of analyzing the</v>

438
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 4>statistics that are generated.</v>

439
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 4>And we can't at this point really be sure whether or not,</v>

440
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

441
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 4>sigh as they put it is that's the whole field of telepathy.</v>

442
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not cy exists,</v>

443
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

444
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of really strong evidence that would suggest it does.</v>

445
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:28.201
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

446
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 4>and I mentioned this in my book,</v>

447
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 4>a couple of the leading skeptics,</v>

448
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:31.714
<v Speaker 4>Chris French,</v>

449
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

450
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Richard Wiseman have both allowed that by the standards of any ordinary science,</v>

451
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 4>telepathy is proven right.</v>

452
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.211
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

453
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 4>if they were just judging kind of a pharmaceutical and looking at the same sorts</v>

454
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 4>of numbers that these guys are,</v>

455
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 4>are generating,</v>

456
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:47.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

457
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.371
<v Speaker 4>they would say,</v>

458
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:48.581
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

459
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 4>something's happening here.</v>

460
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

461
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.330
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

462
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.163
<v Speaker 4>there's an effect.</v>

463
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.830
<v Speaker 4>But because it's a quote,</v>

464
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary claim,</v>

465
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:54.821
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

466
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 4>we don't understand the physics of this,</v>

467
00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 4>what the mechanism would be that would allow for telepathy.</v>

468
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 4>We need greater evidence.</v>

469
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.341
<v Speaker 4>And what,</v>

470
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 4>when you say that it's been proven how so?</v>

471
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

472
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

473
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.441
<v Speaker 4>there again,</v>

474
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 4>this is why he's been in French who I'm quoting,</v>

475
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 4>but they would say that like,</v>

476
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 4>say something like the Ganzfeld,</v>

477
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

478
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 4>test if you're familiar with that.</v>

479
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:12.251
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

480
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:12.641
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>

481
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:13.010
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

482
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 4>The Ganzfeld test,</v>

483
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

484
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 4>they'll have a,</v>

485
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:16.910
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

486
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 4>there's many different ways to set it up,</v>

487
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

488
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 4>But one of the ways to set it up is you've got a person who is the,</v>

489
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.843
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

490
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.103
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

491
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 4>one of the sub test subjects that has,</v>

492
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 4>have to ping pong balls,</v>

493
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 4>put over their eyes,</v>

494
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.373
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

495
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

496
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 4>they have white noise being pumped into their ears and they're put into a very</v>

497
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 4>comfortable chair where they're just sort of kind of suspended.</v>

498
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 4>So there's very,</v>

499
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 4>very little input into the system at that point.</v>

500
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 4>And there are the receiver,</v>

501
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

502
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 4>And they're in a soundproof room,</v>

503
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 4>so they're getting no normal whatsoever,</v>

504
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.330
<v Speaker 4>but they're supposed</v>

505
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 6>to to just kind of go within,</v>

506
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

507
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 6>listen to themselves,</v>

508
00:14:56.391 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 6>what thoughts occurred to them and start reporting back on what it is that</v>

509
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 6>they're seeing in their mind's eye hearing in their mind,</v>

510
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.023
<v Speaker 6>that kind of thing.</v>

511
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 6>And in another room,</v>

512
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

513
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 6>the center is actually,</v>

514
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 6>they're in a soundproof room,</v>

515
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 6>two locked away from,</v>

516
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.534
<v Speaker 6>from the receiver.</v>

517
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 6>They are looking at some sort of stimulus.</v>

518
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 6>They're looking at an image on a computer,</v>

519
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

520
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 6>perhaps or you know,</v>

521
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 6>photos in front of them.</v>

522
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

523
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.930
<v Speaker 6>they are trying to send that image to the person in the other room who they may</v>

524
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:30.411
<v Speaker 6>or may not know,</v>

525
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:31.244
<v Speaker 6>depending on the study.</v>

526
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.910
<v Speaker 6>And then there are there for target images that are then presented usually in</v>

527
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 6>the best studies than an impartial judge will,</v>

528
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

529
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 6>look at a transcript of what the receiver said,</v>

530
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.573
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

531
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 6>And then they'll have four images in front of them,</v>

532
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:53.530
<v Speaker 6>one of which was the target that the center was actually trying to mentally send</v>

533
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:54.524
<v Speaker 6>to the receiver.</v>

534
00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
<v Speaker 6>And you would expect that if the person with the ping pong balls over their eyes</v>

535
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 6>got absolutely nothing,</v>

536
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.700
<v Speaker 6>then the judge would select the correct image one out of four times.</v>

537
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.290
<v Speaker 6>But instead you do enough trials and the men analyses on these,</v>

538
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 6>when they crunch all the numbers from all the studies together and shows more</v>

539
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:18.320
<v Speaker 6>like a 32% effect instead of being right one on a four times,</v>

540
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 6>they're right 32% of the time.</v>

541
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 6>And this Wiseman and French would allow that.</v>

542
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:27.800
<v Speaker 6>These studies are generally well controlled enough that if this was an ordinary</v>

543
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 6>claim that was being presented,</v>

544
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

545
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.861
<v Speaker 6>this was,</v>

546
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 6>this is fine and we would accept this as evidence that something's up here,</v>

547
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 6>some kind of information transfer.</v>

548
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 6>The problem is because we don't understand the physics of how this would work,</v>

549
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 6>they say we need greater evidence than this and they keep asking for greater and</v>

550
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 6>greater levels of scientific controls to be put on the studies.</v>

551
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.890
<v Speaker 6>And they keep,</v>

552
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:48.690
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

553
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 6>just finding ways to kind of reject the result.</v>

554
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 6>I've never been skeptical of the potential for psychic phenomenon,</v>

555
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 6>but I've been very skeptical about almost every store that I've ever heard.</v>

556
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.381
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>

557
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 6>I've met a lot of fakers,</v>

558
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 6>I've been a lot of fake psychics.</v>

559
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 6>I met a lot of crazy girls and want to tell you they're like clairvoyant,</v>

560
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

561
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 6>and people who are channelers and just,</v>

562
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 6>there's so many looney tunes that are connected to it,</v>

563
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.310
<v Speaker 6>but a 32% increase sounds to me like probably what's real.</v>

564
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 6>It's that I think that human average though,</v>

565
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.450
<v Speaker 6>when you think that would be about average,</v>

566
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 6>if you were to do the same study with,</v>

567
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 6>without having somebody trying to,</v>

568
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

569
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:31.723
<v Speaker 6>just the protein,</v>

570
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 6>25% without it,</v>

571
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 6>25% of 32%.</v>

572
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.661
<v Speaker 6>That's the idea.</v>

573
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 6>So there's a small leap to seven.</v>

574
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

575
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.643
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it is,</v>

576
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.103
<v Speaker 6>chance.</v>

577
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 6>But what's interesting in that 7%,</v>

578
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:44.421
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

579
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:46.340
<v Speaker 6>if it's really statistically real,</v>

580
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 6>if the study hasn't been fucked with the,</v>

581
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

582
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 6>the idea is that it's just a little bit,</v>

583
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:51.620
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

584
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 6>It was just a little bit,</v>

585
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 6>the idea is that there's this weak signal that we're not normally picking up on.</v>

586
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 6>Especially look at the way we live now,</v>

587
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 6>where we're constantly,</v>

588
00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.191
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

589
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:03.020
<v Speaker 6>constantly being bombarded by information and input and just stimulus.</v>

590
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 6>But when you shut all that out and you close your eyes and you don't have any</v>

591
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 6>sound that distracts you,</v>

592
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 6>what's there?</v>

593
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 6>Are you receiving any kind of accurate information?</v>

594
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 6>And I'm,</v>

595
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 6>I found the research really tantalizing.</v>

596
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:14.971
<v Speaker 6>And I also,</v>

597
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:15.331
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

598
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 6>I found it scary because I thought,</v>

599
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:16.831
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

600
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 6>here I am now I'm going to write that.</v>

601
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.870
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

602
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 6>When they tell you there's no evidence.</v>

603
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of bullshit,</v>

604
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.130
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

605
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.390
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

606
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.750
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

607
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.340
<v Speaker 6>in fact there,</v>

608
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 6>there is some evidence and the question is whether or not it's risen to the</v>

609
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Speaker 6>level yet where we have to accept it.</v>

610
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.753
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

611
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

612
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 6>It's a fascinating possibility that I think is inevitable.</v>

613
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.800
<v Speaker 6>I think it's inevitable either technologically or it's inevitable due to our own</v>

614
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 6>bodies advancing and changing and mutation.</v>

615
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 6>Because I feel like if you look at lower primates and you know,</v>

616
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

617
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 6>they're very rudimentary language.</v>

618
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 6>I think the chimps repeat certain sounds and they meet might mean certain</v>

619
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

620
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 6>but it's nowhere near what we can do.</v>

621
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.310
<v Speaker 6>And I've got to assume that this isn't the end.</v>

622
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.140
<v Speaker 6>This isn't the last version of the ape.</v>

623
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.381
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

624
00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:02.500
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

625
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 6>if apes are going to continue to be successful,</v>

626
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.930
<v Speaker 6>this model's not going to stick around forever.</v>

627
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.190
<v Speaker 6>You could look at this one of two ways.</v>

628
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.900
<v Speaker 6>One way maybe we're evolving the ability right?</v>

629
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 6>Another way,</v>

630
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.900
<v Speaker 6>maybe we're losing it,</v>

631
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

632
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 6>So back in the day when we were,</v>

633
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 6>you mentioned before the sense of being stared at been some really good research</v>

634
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:19.951
<v Speaker 6>on this.</v>

635
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.161
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

636
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 6>when the skeptics I mentioned Richard Wiseman did it,</v>

637
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Speaker 6>did a study with a woman named Marilyn Schlitz where they collaborated and they</v>

638
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Speaker 6>did three separate studies trying to figure out whether or not somebody could</v>

639
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 6>sense that.</v>

640
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 6>Some of us staring at the back of their head and they had realized controls on</v>

641
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:35.161
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

642
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:36.830
<v Speaker 6>Why spin was part of uh,</v>

643
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

644
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.913
<v Speaker 6>the experiment.</v>

645
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 6>Two out of the three times they did it,</v>

646
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.270
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

647
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 6>they got it again,</v>

648
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 6>a statistically significant effect where people were right of,</v>

649
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

650
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 6>far more often than chance would have suggested.</v>

651
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 6>And if you think of it in an evolutionary sense,</v>

652
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.330
<v Speaker 6>which I do in the book,</v>

653
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

654
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.950
<v Speaker 6>is that back in the day when we were being hunted all the time,</v>

655
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:56.220
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

656
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.180
<v Speaker 6>when we didn't have the kinds of fortifications we have now against the angry</v>

657
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:01.970
<v Speaker 6>packs of wolves that are out there and,</v>

658
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

659
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.443
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

660
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 6>we would have needed to have this ability to know that we're being stared at.</v>

661
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:08.971
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

662
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:09.331
<v Speaker 6>we would have,</v>

663
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 6>it would have helped us survive as a species.</v>

664
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.863
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

665
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:13.651
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

666
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 6>It makes sense.</v>

667
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.110
<v Speaker 6>Especially,</v>

668
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

669
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:19.580
<v Speaker 6>when you consider there's gotta be some pretty intense focus when a Predator</v>

670
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 6>locks on you,</v>

671
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

672
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:26.481
<v Speaker 6>and that if there is some sort of a psychic bond out there between entities,</v>

673
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.800
<v Speaker 6>like the feeling like this motherfucker is about JP,</v>

674
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 6>that's what it should fricking kick in.</v>

675
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:31.944
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

676
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 6>Does you know what if they can feel it?</v>

677
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

678
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.400
<v Speaker 6>I think that there's probably a lot of senses that we lost in our separation</v>

679
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 6>from the,</v>

680
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.930
<v Speaker 6>the natural world to here.</v>

681
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 6>Just intuitive senses.</v>

682
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 6>The army has done some research on</v>

683
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

684
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 4>intuition really and,</v>

685
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 4>and who their most intuitive,</v>

686
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 4>intuitive people are.</v>

687
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's the Co these people are the ones that they'll sort of look at to notice</v>

688
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 4>when there's a hidden explosive device on the ground in Iraq.</v>

689
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

690
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 4>And they've found that that to two groups in particular,</v>

691
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:05.141
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a third,</v>

692
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:05.561
<v Speaker 4>but there's two.</v>

693
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:07.760
<v Speaker 4>What I was remember that,</v>

694
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:09.860
<v Speaker 4>that are really good at this um,</v>

695
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 4>hunters and uh,</v>

696
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 4>people from the inner city.</v>

697
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:20.120
<v Speaker 4>And so suburbian milky people are fucking useless apparently.</v>

698
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 4>So I knew that was the problem.</v>

699
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 4>Everybody a break about it from the point of view of the person in the inner</v>

700
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>

701
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 4>they've got to be aware of their entire environment and the potential for</v>

702
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:29.464
<v Speaker 4>danger.</v>

703
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 4>And they've got to get used to honoring that impulse that something's a little</v>

704
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:34.144
<v Speaker 4>off here.</v>

705
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I need to respect that,</v>

706
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

707
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 4>in order to stay alive.</v>

708
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 4>And so the people who are best at finding these hidden explicit devices just can</v>

709
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 4>tell it something just feels off in this area.</v>

710
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 4>And then they start focusing in on what really,</v>

711
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

712
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:46.841
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know,</v>

713
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:47.351
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

714
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:51.120
<v Speaker 4>that the army actually used intuitive people to try to find bombs.</v>

715
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Keep,</v>

716
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 4>keep,</v>

717
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.331
<v Speaker 4>keep in mind,</v>

718
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 4>this is not about,</v>

719
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

720
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 4>psychic ability,</v>

721
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

722
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

723
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.870
<v Speaker 4>at least they're not talking about it in that context.</v>

724
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.670
<v Speaker 4>The army has done remote viewing,</v>

725
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

726
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

727
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.471
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>

728
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:03.221
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff in the past.</v>

729
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

730
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.481
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

731
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 4>this is a very straightforward intuition.</v>

732
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.630
<v Speaker 4>You can somebody who can just very,</v>

733
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 4>very aware of their surroundings,</v>

734
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 4>very aware of what's around them and alert to something that just seems wrong in</v>

735
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 4>the environment.</v>

736
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 4>That's not necessarily psychic at all.</v>

737
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.623
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

738
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's real and it,</v>

739
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.040
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

740
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 4>but it hearkens back to that a little bit.</v>

741
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 4>That idea is psychic though.</v>

742
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.563
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

743
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 4>you can just have some spidey sense.</v>

744
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

745
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're,</v>

746
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 4>I think they're telling a lie,</v>

747
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

748
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 4>I think they're toeing the line there.</v>

749
00:22:38.201 --> 00:22:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Right up on that line where spidey sense and Taco spidey senses right where we</v>

750
00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:43.564
<v Speaker 4>should be.</v>

751
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 4>But the language they're using is,</v>

752
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 4>is clearly very,</v>

753
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

754
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:47.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

755
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 4>hardcore have a dream.</v>

756
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 4>This is something that I've always wanted to ask someone like you have police</v>

757
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:57.350
<v Speaker 4>really used psychics to find victims or any of that stuff?</v>

758
00:22:57.351 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Was any of that stuff ever really panned out?</v>

759
00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.301
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

760
00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 4>I've actually done a lot of police reporting in my past as well as,</v>

761
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

762
00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:04.031
<v Speaker 4>this book.</v>

763
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's kind of generally,</v>

764
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 4>I read about cops,</v>

765
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 4>crime courts,</v>

766
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:08.651
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

767
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:09.484
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

768
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 4>I spend a lot of time with cops and there's one homicide detective I know who</v>

769
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 4>had absolutely it just,</v>

770
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 4>and he's actually a religious guy,</v>

771
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of interesting.</v>

772
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 4>He hates psychics.</v>

773
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.283
<v Speaker 4>They have,</v>

774
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 4>they have led him on so many or tried to lead him on so many wild goose chases.</v>

775
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 4>They screw with him when he's in the middle of a tough homicide investigation.</v>

776
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 4>He's getting phone calls sometimes when it was higher.</v>

777
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 4>UPS will be,</v>

778
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 4>maybe you ought to listen,</v>

779
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 4>maybe you gotta hear this out.</v>

780
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:37.571
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

781
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 4>he cannot stand them.</v>

782
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 4>But I recently met and I've really,</v>

783
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Speaker 4>I've got to follow up with this guy.</v>

784
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.503
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

785
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 4>and I haven't yet,</v>

786
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but I met a retired</v>

787
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 2>homicide detective who told me he wanted to talk to me because he has worked</v>

788
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 2>with a psychic who gave him good actionable information on multiple occasions.</v>

789
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't had a chance to,</v>

790
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 2>to sit down with Pankaj yet.</v>

791
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I bet it was bone or trying to promote a business.</v>

792
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I know how that works.</v>

793
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was doing as an old guy.</v>

794
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:05.684
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure he's both.</v>

795
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 2>He's got to do what he's gotta do.</v>

796
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:07.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

797
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:09.380
<v Speaker 2>chick's got a psychic business.</v>

798
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I touch to keep the lights on this day and age.</v>

799
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted to know.</v>

800
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

801
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot of people talk about it,</v>

802
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but everybody that I've heard talk about it hasn't researched it.</v>

803
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:18.861
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

804
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:19.270
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't,</v>

805
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not everybody wants to say,</v>

806
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 2>psych,</v>

808
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.630
<v Speaker 2>they've used psychics to find bodies.</v>

809
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

810
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 2>have they,</v>

811
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.781
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

812
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>they really,</v>

813
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they have,</v>

814
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.001
<v Speaker 2>you know what Joe,</v>

815
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of cases that are still sort of tantalizing out there that</v>

816
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:29.691
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

817
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:30.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe something happened,</v>

818
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:24:31.111 --> 00:24:31.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

820
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe they didn't get actual information.</v>

821
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.793
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part,</v>

822
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.760
<v Speaker 2>if you even watch the psychic investigators show,</v>

823
00:24:35.761 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 2>what's really sort of funny about it is that even when they're saying,</v>

824
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 2>that this information was so valuable,</v>

826
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 2>usually if you're really paying attention,</v>

827
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:44.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually the information that broke the case.</v>

828
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:45.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

829
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 2>it's information that after the fact seem to fit.</v>

830
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.213
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

831
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

832
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.540
<v Speaker 2>so I'm still,</v>

833
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

834
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>

835
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm still skeptical and everything,</v>

836
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'm skeptical of the psychics helping detectives.</v>

837
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>But I'm really open to it because again,</v>

838
00:24:58.581 --> 00:24:59.270
<v Speaker 2>if this,</v>

839
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 2>if there is this sort of weak signal out there,</v>

840
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that occasionally we pick up on,</v>

842
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe sometimes it provides actionable information.</v>

843
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember this psychic friends network?</v>

844
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

845
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember what show it was?</v>

846
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 2>A Dionne Warwick or Warwick and Dionne Warwick are caught with weed at the</v>

847
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 2>airport as what made her psychic.</v>

848
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:16.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:25:16.531 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what we should make to asshole.</v>

850
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:19.484
<v Speaker 2>She was working with.</v>

851
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

852
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I think when you smoke pot you get a little more kick there.</v>

853
00:25:23.031 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 2>You make that a quote.</v>

854
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:25.154
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

855
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I just to discredit me,</v>

856
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 2>take it in context though.</v>

857
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

858
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:31.900
<v Speaker 2>you become super sensitive and in,</v>

859
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 2>in that that like you become very aware of,</v>

860
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 2>people are creepy very,</v>

861
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>where people are angry,</v>

862
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 2>very aware of weird tension.</v>

863
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

864
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 2>it makes it like really sensitive.</v>

865
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It makes you really aware of bad acting too.</v>

866
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.770
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to get high and watch some bad acting like Whoa,</v>

867
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking faking it.</v>

868
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 2>And that is sort of like what,</v>

869
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.670
<v Speaker 2>what acting really is,</v>

870
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:52.021
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

871
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:57.021
<v Speaker 2>the best actors can lock into a role so deeply that they almost must believe it</v>

872
00:25:57.311 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 2>in themselves because they're convincing you,</v>

873
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:00.890
<v Speaker 2>even though you know it's Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

874
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>you know he's not really an Irish boxer.</v>

876
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.420
<v Speaker 2>You believe it cause he's,</v>

877
00:26:06.421 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 2>he's tricked you.</v>

878
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:07.940
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

879
00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 2>he's bypassed all of your psychic energy.</v>

880
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 2>But when you're high and you watched someone faking the funk,</v>

881
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>just going through the,</v>

882
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

883
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.501
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

884
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing up there?</v>

885
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you see them acting.</v>

886
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just rude.</v>

887
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>

888
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting to watch it early and later Deniro in that context.</v>

889
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

890
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You're so right.</v>

891
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Is there ever a guy who's fallen so far for grains?</v>

892
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.400
<v Speaker 2>It's so sad.</v>

893
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Meet the Fockers really to fuck you to whatever the number two was.</v>

894
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.411
<v Speaker 2>Little Fuck,</v>

895
00:26:37.411 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>we fucked you again.</v>

896
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Those little fuckers are bad.</v>

897
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:39.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

898
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even saying that that's a bad movie,</v>

899
00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like,</v>

900
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.470
<v Speaker 2>that's Robert Deniro,</v>

901
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:45.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:48.130
<v Speaker 2>and he's doing some new movie now with Lnr,</v>

903
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.130
<v Speaker 2>although are they get in a fight with each other or Alan Arkin rather?</v>

904
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just like he was in that movie.</v>

905
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.810
<v Speaker 2>We play like a wizard and shit.</v>

906
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

907
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

908
00:26:57.881 --> 00:26:59.140
<v Speaker 2>What was the movie with Robert De Niro?</v>

909
00:26:59.141 --> 00:27:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Played like a wizard wizard.</v>

910
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.500
<v Speaker 2>It was like a really bad,</v>

911
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Speaker 2>like the Hobbit type movie.</v>

912
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It looks so stupid.</v>

913
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

914
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.343
<v Speaker 2>Robert,</v>

915
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.610
<v Speaker 2>what is going on?</v>

916
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess after a while you're like,</v>

917
00:27:11.021 --> 00:27:11.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

918
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.730
<v Speaker 2>I did my time.</v>

919
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I feel I did my Goodfellows.</v>

920
00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I did my raging bulls.</v>

921
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm just from here on in and have some fun.</v>

922
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

923
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I think about what he did for Cape Fear and he,</v>

924
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 2>he was fucking incredible on a wait for a raging bull.</v>

925
00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

926
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.760
<v Speaker 2>too much sacrifice.</v>

928
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a taxi driver and he said just a fucking tremendous actor just in his prime</v>

929
00:27:34.061 --> 00:27:34.661
<v Speaker 2>and his youth.</v>

930
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:36.040
<v Speaker 2>He was just unstoppable.</v>

931
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.060
<v Speaker 2>The deer hunter,</v>

932
00:27:37.061 --> 00:27:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

933
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.231
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

934
00:27:38.231 --> 00:27:39.340
<v Speaker 2>that was a fucking movie.</v>

935
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.990
<v Speaker 2>He did some incredible,</v>

936
00:27:40.991 --> 00:27:41.890
<v Speaker 2>incredible shit,</v>

937
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.050
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff he's doing now,</v>

938
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.043
<v Speaker 2>Barb,</v>

939
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Barb,</v>

940
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.863
<v Speaker 2>Robert,</v>

941
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.353
<v Speaker 2>sad,</v>

942
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.470
<v Speaker 2>sad to see man,</v>

943
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.540
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked.</v>

944
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's feeling really sad right now.</v>

945
00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.720
<v Speaker 3>Getting that Betty is that he's not as nearly as happy</v>

946
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:02.570
<v Speaker 2>busy was during the raging bull days when he was just creating something fucking</v>

947
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.530
<v Speaker 2>magnificent.</v>

948
00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:04.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

949
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.970
<v Speaker 2>I think tiff,</v>

950
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.250
<v Speaker 2>he got into with JC watts.</v>

951
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Robert De Niro got a tiff with Jay Z.</v>

952
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.281
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

954
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:11.210
<v Speaker 2>How is that possible?</v>

955
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.870
<v Speaker 2>She was apparently a trying to Phelan Jay z to talk about some sort of</v>

956
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.480
<v Speaker 2>entertainment event that was going on in JC.</v>

957
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Didn't call him back.</v>

958
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.990
<v Speaker 2>And so de Niro in public kind of dressed him down for it.</v>

959
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

960

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.280
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that one was just too busy too.</v>

965
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:26.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1013
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's Bobby de Niro as red band in his sixties.</v>

1014
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea for a movie.</v>

1015
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.233
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1016
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:41.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1017
00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:42.674
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1018
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 4>So don't make that.</v>

1019
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.061
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

1020
00:29:47.061 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 4>what subject did you get started with?</v>

1021
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 4>What led you to just pursue this,</v>

1022
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1023
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.451
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1024
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:52.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1025
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.021
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1026
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 4>the storyline in this book or the idea of won in this book of just chasing down</v>

1027
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 4>all things French.</v>

1028
00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 4>There were a couple of things that,</v>

1029
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 4>and that motivated me.</v>

1030
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1031
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.020
<v Speaker 4>one of them was a family goes story I grew up with as a kid,</v>

1032
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1033
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 4>where supposedly our house,</v>

1034
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 4>these are my red band notes by the way,</v>

1035
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:08.621
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1036
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 4>And as you're noticing this,</v>

1037
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:10.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

1038
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm an avid listener of the show and I know he might say totally random shit</v>

1039
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 4>that will totally distract me.</v>

1040
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 4>And if you guys don't want to be able to take a note on where I was,</v>

1041
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:18.610
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

1042
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Move the car.</v>

1043
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 4>We should have it for you.</v>

1044
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.373
<v Speaker 4>You're far,</v>

1045
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.100
<v Speaker 4>definitely guess captain flow record.</v>

1046
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 4>So I um,</v>

1047
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I grew up with a ghost story,</v>

1048
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 4>a ghost that was supposedly in my house.</v>

1049
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 4>This stuff happened when I was five or six years old,</v>

1050
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 4>so I have very fragmented memories of it,</v>

1051
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 4>but it was a,</v>

1052
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.893
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1053
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 4>it's really sort of starts with the cliche.</v>

1054
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 4>It was a thing that went bump in the night,</v>

1055
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.991
<v Speaker 4>only at bumped.</v>

1056
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:44.390
<v Speaker 4>It thought it,</v>

1057
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.223
<v Speaker 4>it boomed.</v>

1058
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1059
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 4>it happened only at night.</v>

1060
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.600
<v Speaker 4>I would go on for tens of minutes at a time.</v>

1061
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 4>It sounded like it was coming from somewhere upstairs.</v>

1062
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 4>So my parents and the first floor thought it was on the roof of the house.</v>

1063
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 4>My brother and I on one side of the house,</v>

1064
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 4>thought it was on the roof over our heads,</v>

1065
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 4>my sisters in their room.</v>

1066
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I did not share an adjoining wall with us.</v>

1067
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:09.511
<v Speaker 4>Thought it was on the roof and or in there up the high in the walls.</v>

1068
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.280
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1069
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.670
<v Speaker 4>at first that's what it was.</v>

1070
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 4>It was this noise,</v>

1071
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:14.261
<v Speaker 4>but it was so loud.</v>

1072
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:16.690
<v Speaker 4>It would wake everybody up and it would go on for awhile.</v>

1073
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 4>And my parents hunted for a prosaic explanations.</v>

1074
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1075
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 4>didn't fit with like a water hammer or anything with the plumbing.</v>

1076
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 4>It didn't fit with the house settling because of how long it went on.</v>

1077
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:30.250
<v Speaker 4>And you have an addict or was it just a roof?</v>

1078
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.143
<v Speaker 4>No attic.</v>

1079
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.223
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1080
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 4>my sister started reporting stranger things.</v>

1081
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:35.920
<v Speaker 4>It's really movie shit.</v>

1082
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1083
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 4>They started reporting that,</v>

1084
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.260
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1085
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.470
<v Speaker 4>their bed frames would shake in the middle of the night and wake them up.</v>

1086
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 4>A claim that they saw a woman walk right through the room.</v>

1087
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1088
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.660
<v Speaker 4>literally eight ghost,</v>

1090
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.320
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1091
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.071
<v Speaker 4>My parents,</v>

1092
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:49.450
<v Speaker 4>and I find this really important.</v>

1093
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 4>My parents set that aside and discounted it for a couple of reasons.</v>

1094
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:57.580
<v Speaker 4>It was coming from kids and who would want to believe that that's true.</v>

1095
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:57.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1096
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the things the skeptics always do is say,</v>

1097
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1098
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of wishful thinking and superstition that people hear a noise and they</v>

1099
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 4>leap to ghost.</v>

1100
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 4>But my family didn't.</v>

1101
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 4>And so they spent nine months or a year trying to recreate the noise and various</v>

1102
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 4>ways trying to figure out what it was.</v>

1103
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 4>And when my sisters would tell these crazy stories,</v>

1104
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:19.090
<v Speaker 4>they were just kind of like number one,</v>

1105
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to believe it.</v>

1106
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to believe your starters are being terrorized at night.</v>

1107
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1108
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Something going on in their room.</v>

1109
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Speaker 4>But finally,</v>

1110
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 4>and I was raised Catholic and we hadn't fallen out of the church yet.</v>

1111
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:29.824
<v Speaker 4>That was still coming.</v>

1112
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1113
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.450
<v Speaker 4>my dad went to the family priest and he told him what was going on cause he'd</v>

1114
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 4>run out of other answers and the priest said,</v>

1115
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:38.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1116
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 4>usually cases like this,</v>

1117
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 4>which I always find that language interesting as well because it implies he does</v>

1118
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 4>this on a fairly regular basis.</v>

1119
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Usually in cases like this,</v>

1120
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 4>I come over and I blessed the house.</v>

1121
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 4>So he came over,</v>

1122
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:54.671
<v Speaker 4>and I remember this vividly because to have father Crowley come into the,</v>

1123
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1124
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.360
<v Speaker 4>come into the house with the vestments on,</v>

1125
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 4>in swinging,</v>

1126
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.523
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1127
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 4>like the incense around and praying and Latin was intense,</v>

1128
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1129
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.123
<v Speaker 4>As a kid.</v>

1130
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:08.263
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1131
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I said like,</v>

1132
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.471
<v Speaker 4>it was like six.</v>

1133
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1134
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 4>he was God himself,</v>

1135
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:11.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1136
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 4>standing up on that pulpit and he comes in our house,</v>

1137
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 4>he's swinging incense around and when he leaves and he says to my dad,</v>

1138
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1139
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.651
<v Speaker 4>so long,</v>

1140
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:18.921
<v Speaker 4>Jerry,</v>

1141
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure everything will be fine.</v>

1142
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 4>But that night actually things got worse.</v>

1143
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:25.850
<v Speaker 4>The booming went on longer and louder than ever before.</v>

1144
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 4>And for the first time it seemed to locate in a specific spot.</v>

1145
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:32.420
<v Speaker 4>So instead of coming from this sort of Amorphous area,</v>

1146
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 4>somewhere up on the roof,</v>

1147
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 4>it hits at the top of the stairs,</v>

1148
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:36.711
<v Speaker 4>the landing,</v>

1149
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 4>and then it came downstairs like one step at a time.</v>

1150
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 4>My father said it sounded like a kid throwing a tantrum and when it hit the</v>

1151
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 4>bottom floor,</v>

1152
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.933
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1153
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 4>they could feel the floor shake under their feet.</v>

1154
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:50.031
<v Speaker 4>My parents,</v>

1155
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:51.110
<v Speaker 4>and we never heard it again.</v>

1156
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:56.340
<v Speaker 4>And so I grow up with this story and I think of it as a,</v>

1157
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:56.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1158
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:57.441
<v Speaker 4>for a long time,</v>

1159
00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 4>all the way through adolescence.</v>

1160
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.620
<v Speaker 4>It was just sort of thing.</v>

1161
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1162
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:00.771
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1163
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:01.011
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1164
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:02.030
<v Speaker 4>an article of faith,</v>

1165
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:03.070
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't even question it.</v>

1166
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.310
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1167
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 4>it just was,</v>

1168
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.911
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1169
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:05.810
<v Speaker 4>you get into college,</v>

1170
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 4>then you start meeting other people and you start getting familiar with critical</v>

1171
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:09.051
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1172
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:09.884
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1173
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 4>the hell is that.</v>

1174
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1175
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 4>what the hell was that?</v>

1176
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 4>That's not how old were you when this was going on?</v>

1177
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 4>I was about six.</v>

1178
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 4>And so whenever memories I have it are very fragmentary,</v>

1179
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 4>but I gotta tell you,</v>

1180
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Joe and I asked my parents about it for the book and I actually interviewed</v>

1181
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:24.110
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1182
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 4>I knew someday I was going to write about this.</v>

1183
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1184
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I interviewed the many years before I really settled on,</v>

1185
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 4>this is the book I'm gonna write.</v>

1186
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 4>And I actually sat down and I recorded it and I will never forget when they were</v>

1187
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 4>describing that last night when it came down the stairs,</v>

1188
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 4>they turn white,</v>

1189
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 4>they held hands across the table.</v>

1190
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:42.200
<v Speaker 4>They were still frightened.</v>

1191
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Just by the memory of it.</v>

1192
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 4>So for them,</v>

1193
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was was tremendously real.</v>

1194
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 4>And I wanted to explore that and see what we could,</v>

1195
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:56.450
<v Speaker 4>there have been anything strange there could they have possibly somehow and in</v>

1196
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Speaker 4>my brothers and sisters do could we,</v>

1197
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 4>all of us somehow imagined all this.</v>

1198
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 4>And so that was part of my inspiration for the book.</v>

1199
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 4>What is your conclusion on that?</v>

1200
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1201
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 4>do you look back?</v>

1202
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:08.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1203
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember anything that happened when I was six that I can tell you</v>

1204
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 4>reliably what really happened.</v>

1205
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 4>I have just a few that's Jews.</v>

1206
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.563
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

1207
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.991
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1208
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 4>And that's true of,</v>

1209
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

1210
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.370
<v Speaker 4>generally of,</v>

1211
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1212
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.331
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>

1213
00:35:21.331 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very hard to trust childhood memories.</v>

1214
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I should trust my own memories of that event.</v>

1215
00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing that's sort of kind of disassociated me from it makes it</v>

1216
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 4>hard to now 43.</v>

1217
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.320
<v Speaker 4>When you look back at six,</v>

1219
00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:33.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1220
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 4>how much do you really,</v>

1221
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.710
<v Speaker 4>how much do you remember if sex actually have a creepy amount of memories?</v>

1222
00:35:38.711 --> 00:35:39.490
<v Speaker 4>From my childhood?</v>

1223
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.323
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.470
<v Speaker 4>But a legit,</v>

1225
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.270
<v Speaker 4>well that's the question I need to,</v>

1226
00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:45.260
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how legitimate they did this.</v>

1227
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.230
<v Speaker 4>A great psychologist,</v>

1228
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.250
<v Speaker 4>child psychologist,</v>

1229
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.283
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1230
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.160
<v Speaker 4>did a lot of studies on this.</v>

1231
00:35:51.161 --> 00:35:52.450
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things he pointed out in his,</v>

1232
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.280
<v Speaker 4>in his own life,</v>

1233
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1234
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.260
<v Speaker 4>he had this very vivid memory of being kidnapped because he was told he was</v>

1235
00:35:59.261 --> 00:35:59.830
<v Speaker 4>kidnapped.</v>

1236
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.850
<v Speaker 4>And then years later,</v>

1237
00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:04.330
<v Speaker 4>the person who was supposedly the witness to the kidnapping admitted that they</v>

1238
00:36:04.331 --> 00:36:05.164
<v Speaker 4>made the story up.</v>

1239
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.920
<v Speaker 4>And so he had this really shocking,</v>

1240
00:36:08.921 --> 00:36:11.020
<v Speaker 4>vivid memory through his whole life.</v>

1241
00:36:11.021 --> 00:36:13.930
<v Speaker 4>I forget at what point it was revealed to him and it wasn't true.</v>

1242
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.630
<v Speaker 4>So that's how much we can be deceived by these things.</v>

1243
00:36:16.631 --> 00:36:18.430
<v Speaker 4>And you asked the conclusion I came to,</v>

1244
00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:20.110
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's very healthy conclusion.</v>

1245
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.250
<v Speaker 4>The conclusion I came to is,</v>

1246
00:36:21.251 --> 00:36:22.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

1247
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.201
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1248
00:36:23.201 --> 00:36:26.170
<v Speaker 4>And there's still mystery there.</v>

1249
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.500
<v Speaker 4>None of the normal prosaic explanations work for me.</v>

1250
00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1251
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.330
<v Speaker 4>It was not a water hammer.</v>

1252
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.440
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1253
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:32.980
<v Speaker 4>it was not.</v>

1254
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1255
00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:34.450
<v Speaker 4>it was not a rat making a noise.</v>

1256
00:36:34.451 --> 00:36:35.080
<v Speaker 4>That pig.</v>

1257
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.210
<v Speaker 4>It was not a a plumbing problem,</v>

1258
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1259
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 4>it was not the house settling.</v>

1260
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember it being really loud?</v>

1261
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Really loud.</v>

1262
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Really loud.</v>

1263
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Like someone slamming a door or something like that at loud.</v>

1264
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.480
<v Speaker 4>Loudest like a sledge hammer getting,</v>

1265
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 4>getting a weld at its loudest and so you go outside and there's no one on the</v>

1266
00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:55.060
<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>

1267
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.351
<v Speaker 4>Funny story there.</v>

1269
00:36:56.351 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 4>And My,</v>

1270
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.930
<v Speaker 4>my parents cause I was so,</v>

1271
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I was so young and I remember this,</v>

1272
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.631
<v Speaker 4>this one,</v>

1273
00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 4>I know this fricken memory is true.</v>

1274
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 4>I remember them taking me outside at night because we were scared to show me,</v>

1275
00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 4>show me that there were raccoons dumping on the roof because it was nighttime</v>

1276
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.050
<v Speaker 4>and this was the story that gave their little kid.</v>

1277
00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:14.801
<v Speaker 4>Oh honey,</v>

1278
00:37:14.801 --> 00:37:16.810
<v Speaker 4>it's just raccoons jumping up and down on the roof.</v>

1279
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.880
<v Speaker 4>And I was young enough that I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>okay raccoon sometimes dope up,</v>

1281

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.340

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1286
00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 4>girls would fight back some gangster shit going on,</v>

1287
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:28.930
<v Speaker 4>gangs,</v>

1288
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.690
<v Speaker 4>raccoons and turning it down on your roof.</v>

1289
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.823
<v Speaker 4>Not enough of them.</v>

1290
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.760
<v Speaker 4>It was an ally.</v>

1291
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Many nights.</v>

1292
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean tens of minutes at a time.</v>

1296
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Raccoons are just bouncing up and down on your roof was like the octagon for the</v>

1297
00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 4>ultimate fighting championship when you're sleeping.</v>

1298
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.980
<v Speaker 4>That would be nice to get out in the middle when you open the door and they just</v>

1299
00:37:47.981 --> 00:37:48.161
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>

1300
00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:49.780
<v Speaker 4>goes through his climb up the trees and hard.</v>

1301
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.110
<v Speaker 2>There's the crafty,</v>

1302
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:53.040
<v Speaker 2>those fucking raccoons.</v>

1303
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I would have set up cameras everywhere.</v>

1304
00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I would have figured that shit out too.</v>

1305
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Long time ago though.</v>

1306
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1307
00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1308
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd put everything in 1975 in 1975 we weren't walking around with these HD</v>

1309
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.600
<v Speaker 2>cameras.</v>

1310
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.433
<v Speaker 2>That vision,</v>

1311
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I get courtroom sketch artist,</v>

1312
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:08.790
<v Speaker 2>he's just put them on every corner of the house.</v>

1313
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Courtroom sketches is the dumbest thing ever that they still have to use someone</v>

1314
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.220
<v Speaker 2>to sketch what's happening.</v>

1315
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't take a picture.</v>

1316
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>It's the beauty of it.</v>

1317
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.513
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1318
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're not supposed to be able to see inside the sacred courtroom where</v>

1319
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>the decisions are being rendered.</v>

1320
00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:23.521
<v Speaker 2>So instead,</v>

1321
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:25.370
<v Speaker 2>here's an artist's depiction of the action.</v>

1322
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>The fuck are you showing me drawings for?</v>

1323
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>You know he can show it to me or you can't.</v>

1324
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that the a real guy at the table?</v>

1325
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:32.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what he looks like.</v>

1326
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the drawing represents what he looks like.</v>

1327
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1328
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Show me a fucking picture.</v>

1329
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.204
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

1330
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.661
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1331
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:38.011
<v Speaker 2>My game,</v>

1332
00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 2>when we plan a flash would be distracting.</v>

1333
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1334
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 2>How about no flashes?</v>

1335
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1336
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it seems pretty easy to just do no flashes.</v>

1337
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.113
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1338
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.231
<v Speaker 2>it's shutter clicks.</v>

1339
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Even weirder.</v>

1340
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Someone's fucking staring at you and drawing you.</v>

1341
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>That's even weirder,</v>

1342
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.474
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1343
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.171
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>

1344
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know you're talking about your,</v>

1345
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 2>your experience and trying to tell the truth,</v>

1346
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 2>the whole truth and nothing but,</v>

1347
00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.000
<v Speaker 2>and some fucking Weirdos.</v>

1348
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I ball in you and drawing your face.</v>

1349
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be a little mind fuck.</v>

1350
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 2>And it would be probably affects your decision making skills when you're in</v>

1351
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:07.204
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>

1352
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1353
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.591
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking true.</v>

1354
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 2>If the cameras are a lot easier to handle that as somebody who was sitting here</v>

1355
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 2>drawing some asshole using outdated technology and could be get here on a horse,</v>

1356
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 2>he'd be taking license with my image to yeah,</v>

1357
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>he got there on a horse.</v>

1358
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 2>All his books are written in script.</v>

1359
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 2>We have courtroom sketch room artists for that show that I do.</v>

1360
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.720
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1361
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.230
<v Speaker 2>they draw during the whole con uh,</v>

1362
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.141
<v Speaker 2>live podcasts.</v>

1363
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 2>The secret show thing.</v>

1364
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.933
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1365
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:31.803
<v Speaker 2>Like here's the Ari,</v>

1366
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 2>let's think the thing that's a good idea</v>

1367
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 2>and we sell it in the artist's gets all the money.</v>

1368
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1369
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:38.494
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea.</v>

1370
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a way better idea and use it in court.</v>

1371
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 2>See we found a new use for those people and I'll have to do that anymore.</v>

1372
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:44.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1373
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 4>this is too though.</v>

1374
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 4>So as the years went on and I would share that story,</v>

1375
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I stopped sharing it.</v>

1376
00:39:49.001 --> 00:39:49.211
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1377
00:39:49.211 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Because I was starting to run into more and more people who were totally</v>

1378
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.340
<v Speaker 4>adamantly opposed,</v>

1379
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1380
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.440
<v Speaker 4>not only oppose the idea of ghosts,</v>

1381
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty suspicious about the idea of coast.</v>

1382
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1383
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 4>They were adamantly opposed to the idea that,</v>

1384
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 4>that there was even a mystery there.</v>

1385
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 4>And so that's kind of what I hold out for in the book,</v>

1386
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 4>that sometimes we just need to be able to admit.</v>

1387
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 4>I just say the words,</v>

1388
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened.</v>

1389
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 4>People want to rush to some kind of conclusion whether they have enough evidence</v>

1390
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 4>or data or not.</v>

1391
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 4>And I ran into people over the years who would insist it had to be a water</v>

1392
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.850
<v Speaker 4>hammer even though it doesn't fit.</v>

1393
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1394
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 4>you know the story at all.</v>

1395
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.550
<v Speaker 2>What is a water hammer?</v>

1396
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.700
<v Speaker 2>That's when the water's Donk,</v>

1397
00:40:26.701 --> 00:40:26.881
<v Speaker 2>donk,</v>

1398
00:40:26.881 --> 00:40:27.091
<v Speaker 2>donk,</v>

1399
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:27.241
<v Speaker 2>donk,</v>

1400
00:40:27.241 --> 00:40:27.451
<v Speaker 2>donk,</v>

1401
00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:27.631
<v Speaker 2>donk,</v>

1402
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:27.871
<v Speaker 2>donk.</v>

1403
00:40:27.871 --> 00:40:28.091
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1404
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it has that crazy noise that I used to live in apartment</v>

1405
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

1406
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 4>He heard that a lot.</v>

1407
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Sudden flow of water stops and then you get that sound because the energy,</v>

1409
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:40.390
<v Speaker 4>the water buildup is converted to caustic energy cause it's gotta go somewhere.</v>

1410
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.621
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1411
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>

1412
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.133
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't,</v>

1413
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't last that long.</v>

1414
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't make that kind of noise.</v>

1415
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 4>And it sounds like,</v>

1416
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.290
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound like it's coming from your,</v>

1417
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.570
<v Speaker 4>your roof or last tens of minutes.</v>

1418
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 4>And it certainly never locates on the steps,</v>

1419
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 4>but this is all when you were six.</v>

1420
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1421
00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1422
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 4>so in the end you kind of have to trust it or not,</v>

1423
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:01.901
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1424
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 4>That's the question you're left with.</v>

1425
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Do I trust my mother and father's account,</v>

1426
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.550
<v Speaker 4>my sister's account,</v>

1427
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:07.390
<v Speaker 4>my brother's account,</v>

1428
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.740
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1429
00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 4>on somewhat on someone like do,</v>

1430
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.900
<v Speaker 4>but can I really buy into the idea that there are ghosts?</v>

1431
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1432
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 4>so one of the things I explored,</v>

1433
00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1434
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I find this really interesting,</v>

1435
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are people out there working with,</v>

1436
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1437
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 4>sort of other,</v>

1438
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1439
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 4>other technologies to determine if maybe there's an abundance of electromagnetic</v>

1440
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Speaker 4>energy in the air in certain areas,</v>

1441
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 4>then it fucks with your temporal lobe.</v>

1442
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 4>Then you have drilling.</v>

1443
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:29.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1444
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

1445
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 4>where was this that it was in Pittsburgh maybe.</v>

1446
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.760
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not a lot of fault lines.</v>

1447
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're all others occasional or is that one in Ohio that they</v>

1448
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.060
<v Speaker 4>just found out that we're making the earthquake happened,</v>

1449
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.790
<v Speaker 4>something that happened,</v>

1450
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1451
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1452
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.833
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1453
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 4>a guy working with infrasound,</v>

1454
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1455
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 4>getting Vic Tandy did research and infrasound.</v>

1456
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a level of sound beneath even the range of human hearing,</v>

1457
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 4>but it actually has an effect.</v>

1458
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 4>It can create a sense of pressure and an easiness in your chest.</v>

1459
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.491
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1460
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 4>it actually can even impact sort of the eyeball,</v>

1461
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 4>the actual vibration in the air and cause you to see a cloudy shapes when there</v>

1462
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:03.524
<v Speaker 4>aren't any.</v>

1463
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any of those concerns clearly explain,</v>

1464
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1465
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 4>what ha whatever happened in my house either.</v>

1466
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 4>But what I like about it is at least,</v>

1467
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 4>at least here somebody is thinking creatively and not thinking so poorly of</v>

1468
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 4>their fellow human that they just,</v>

1469
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:16.401
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1470
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 4>you heard a creaking floorboard and you jumped to a fucking ghost because you're</v>

1471
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:19.531
<v Speaker 4>that stupid.</v>

1472
00:42:19.531 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's a superstitious it,</v>

1473
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of explanations,</v>

1474
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I think grant people the proper dignity to be,</v>

1475
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.473
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1476
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 4>that they're reporting things at least somewhat accurately write something</v>

1477
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 4>really unusual was happening.</v>

1478
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:32.741
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1479
00:42:32.741 --> 00:42:33.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1480
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unfortunate reality that we live in that I can't trust anybody to</v>

1481
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:41.590
<v Speaker 1>tell me like what really happened.</v>

1482
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1483
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:42.580
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

1484
00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>when a legitimate event,</v>

1485
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.600
<v Speaker 1>if the legitimate event occurs,</v>

1486
00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it's immediately dismissed.</v>

1487
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.610
<v Speaker 1>If you really looked at how many strange things exist both in the natural world</v>

1488
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.080
<v Speaker 1>and in the,</v>

1489
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:56.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1490
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.401
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

1491
00:42:57.401 --> 00:43:00.130
<v Speaker 1>just the world of space,</v>

1492
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.510
<v Speaker 1>just the world of dark matter and supernovas and all those things are way</v>

1493
00:43:04.511 --> 00:43:05.650
<v Speaker 1>crazier than ghosts.</v>

1494
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:06.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1495
00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:08.530
<v Speaker 1>A ghosting shit compared to the sun.</v>

1496
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1497
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.200
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're living in a multiverse,</v>

1498
00:43:11.201 --> 00:43:14.110
<v Speaker 1>that there's an infinite number of us having this conversation right now and</v>

1499
00:43:14.111 --> 00:43:17.980
<v Speaker 1>then something that is life exists at all that you can see with eyeballs,</v>

1500
00:43:17.981 --> 00:43:18.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1501
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:21.640
<v Speaker 1>that is just as freaky as something that used to live,</v>

1502
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but its essence in some form stays for some reason.</v>

1503
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that this dimension that we live in is super concrete and you</v>

1504
00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:31.151
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1505
00:43:31.151 --> 00:43:36.151
<v Speaker 1>just cause you can hit it with a fucking balled fist and push it into a street</v>

1506
00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 1>and watch a car slam into it.</v>

1507
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:41.980
<v Speaker 1>But when you're dealing with real solid objects and that's all there is here,</v>

1508
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I told him necessarily by that I don't,</v>

1509
00:43:44.891 --> 00:43:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1510
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in most of what I hear in terms of psychics and psychic readings</v>

1511
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>and ghost stories.</v>

1512
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I think most of it's bullshit,</v>

1513
00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's very possible that something remains of you and that you're not</v>

1514
00:44:00.341 --> 00:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>just skin tissue and bone tissue and blood and more than me.</v>

1515
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1516
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:10.180
<v Speaker 1>there might be something going on and that something might leave your body and</v>

1517
00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:15.181
<v Speaker 1>exist in some other state and almost an enact assessable environment that's</v>

1518
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.770
<v Speaker 1>parallels us.</v>

1519
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's not outside the realm of possibility.</v>

1520
00:44:19.691 --> 00:44:21.070
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so woo woo,</v>

1521
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1522
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not because life itself,</v>

1523
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:24.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1524
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.050
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea that your,</v>

1525
00:44:26.051 --> 00:44:31.051
<v Speaker 1>your body is just this big chemical reaction and electromagnetic and</v>

1526
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.090
<v Speaker 4>oh that's crazy.</v>

1527
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Neuroscientists can't yet answer the basic question of how consciousness is</v>

1528
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 4>produced.</v>

1529
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:37.621
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1530
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 4>So how we get from the physical stuff of the brain to nonphysical subjective</v>

1531
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 4>experience is a complete and total mystery.</v>

1532
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:46.050
<v Speaker 4>And yet it is the thing that really defines our lives,</v>

1533
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 4>our internal experience of the world.</v>

1534
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 4>And there is no explanation for it.</v>

1535
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Like how scientists get to what's,</v>

1536
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 4>what part of the brain does what?</v>

1537
00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy got an injury here.</v>

1538
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 4>So that removes this part of the brain that removes his ability to do this.</v>

1539
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 4>He's got an injury here.</v>

1540
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1541
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 4>well now we know that this,</v>

1542
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 4>this inhibits walking and this is where,</v>

1543
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:08.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1544
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 4>your eyesight is dealt with.</v>

1545
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.560
<v Speaker 4>But what they can't figure out is where's the thinking person with morals and</v>

1546
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.050
<v Speaker 4>ethics and love?</v>

1547
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Where's he in there?</v>

1548
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Is he just a crackling?</v>

1549
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 4>Is he just the energy that makes all those cells fire where she,</v>

1550
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 4>where's the girl who can,</v>

1551
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1552
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.180
<v Speaker 4>who can enjoy the things that she enjoys and,</v>

1553
00:45:32.181 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 4>and enjoy the food that she can do is where,</v>

1554
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 4>where's all that?</v>

1555
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 4>And there's something else to consider too,</v>

1556
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:36.751
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

1557
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1558
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:37.561
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1559
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:41.070
<v Speaker 4>so we get these damage to our brain and we'll lose certain faculties.</v>

1560
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes we only lose them for a certain time,</v>

1561
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1562
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 4>Because of neuroplasticity.</v>

1563
00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 4>These things come back online and where an or other parts of the brain simply</v>

1564
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 4>pick up those functions.</v>

1565
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 4>And this is easier to do when you're younger than when you're older.</v>

1566
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1567
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1568
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 4>the thing that fascinates me are people who will lose their memory for a certain</v>

1569
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 4>time and then those memories begin to come back.</v>

1570
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.601
<v Speaker 4>And this is a,</v>

1571
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:04.081
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1572
00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 4>a relatively common thing.</v>

1573
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1574
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.860
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

1575
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 4>how does that happen?</v>

1576
00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Where were the memory is stored?</v>

1577
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Where did they go and they were gone?</v>

1578
00:46:10.741 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good question and it's one that happens when people get concussions.</v>

1579
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.560
<v Speaker 4>There's a concussions cause a great deal of short term memory loss.</v>

1580
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:20.641
<v Speaker 4>It's out of the,</v>

1581
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:20.791
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1582
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 4>actually looked at this a little bit in the book.</v>

1583
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:27.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean doctors will assess how severe a person's injury was by,</v>

1584
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1585
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.150
<v Speaker 4>coming up with a degree of memory loss.</v>

1586
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Like asking them,</v>

1587
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 4>what's the last thing you remember before the injury?</v>

1588
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 4>What's the first thing you remember after the injury?</v>

1589
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:35.470
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1590
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 4>the longer the blank period,</v>

1591
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 4>the more hurt you are.</v>

1592
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I looked at near death experiences in the book and that's,</v>

1593
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.260
<v Speaker 4>so that's one of the things that you mean there because what's,</v>

1594
00:46:43.261 --> 00:46:48.261
<v Speaker 4>what's weird about these guys is that in girls is they oftentimes come back with</v>

1595
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:53.510
<v Speaker 4>a totally flowing memory of an event that should have knocked their memory,</v>

1596
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:57.900
<v Speaker 4>producing capabilities offline for a certain amount of time.</v>

1597
00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And yet somehow didn't seem too,</v>

1598
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1599
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.690
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

1600
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with saying like,</v>

1601
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.100
<v Speaker 4>like within your death experience,</v>

1602
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:09.180
<v Speaker 4>I take a lot of flack really from both sides because believers will contact me</v>

1603
00:47:09.181 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 4>and say they're upset that I won't come out and say that,</v>

1604
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:11.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1605
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 4>the near death experience is smoking gun evidence that there's an afterlife.</v>

1606
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1607
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:15.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1608
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is smoking gun evidence that there's an afterlife,</v>

1609
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 4>but I also don't think it's yet been explained.</v>

1610
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1611
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.840
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1612
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:24.750
<v Speaker 4>we end up back in this place where everybody wants to act like they know</v>

1613
00:47:24.751 --> 00:47:25.141
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1614
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to push everything into a conclusion.</v>

1615
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.840
<v Speaker 4>I think the most rational thing to say is we,</v>

1616
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>we fully understand that</v>

1617
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.461
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1618
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

1619
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1620
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.470
<v Speaker 1>in the near death experience,</v>

1621
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it has to be related to what you're,</v>

1622
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you're on brain can produce as far as psychedelic chemicals.</v>

1623
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It has to be your own brain produces the most potent psychedelic drug known to</v>

1624
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1625
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And why wouldn't it produce that shit if you were going to die?</v>

1626
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're in high stress periods,</v>

1627
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 1>if you're freaking,</v>

1628
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:49.601
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1629
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 1>this is the end,</v>

1630
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 1>your body thinks this is it,</v>

1631
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die and then it comes back,</v>

1632
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:54.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:55.091
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1634
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you've very likely could have come back from a psychedelic trip as well.</v>

1635
00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1636
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:58.891
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you,</v>

1637
00:47:58.891 --> 00:48:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to cut straight to the chase.</v>

1638
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.300
<v Speaker 4>The best evidence that the MD has to provide.</v>

1639
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1640
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.250
<v Speaker 4>This is the Best Janice minor holding a researcher did a study where she went</v>

1641
00:48:08.251 --> 00:48:10.410
<v Speaker 4>through all the medical literature and all the research that's been done in</v>

1642
00:48:10.411 --> 00:48:10.581
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

1643
00:48:10.581 --> 00:48:13.020
<v Speaker 4>you so far and she tabulated,</v>

1644
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1645
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.970
<v Speaker 4>veridical perceptions,</v>

1646
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.890
<v Speaker 4>so accurate and true perceptions that people got wow quote out of body.</v>

1647
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 4>And what she came up with is that,</v>

1648
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.443
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1649
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:29.100
<v Speaker 4>out of 38 cases in the medical literature where people were able to recount what</v>

1650
00:48:29.101 --> 00:48:34.101
<v Speaker 4>was going on in the room when they were flatlined or above the table and all</v>

1651
00:48:35.281 --> 00:48:36.000
<v Speaker 4>that stuff of stuff,</v>

1652
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.600
<v Speaker 4>right when they were in this sort of severe physical distress,</v>

1653
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.750
<v Speaker 4>35 of them were accurate and every detail they reported,</v>

1654
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:44.790
<v Speaker 4>two of them had minor errors.</v>

1655
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.320
<v Speaker 4>This sort of errors I'd have,</v>

1656
00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:46.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1657
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.690
<v Speaker 4>if I was trying to describe what I had for breakfast today,</v>

1658
00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1659
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:49.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1660
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I might miss something and then one person was just totally off the freaking</v>

1661
00:48:52.381 --> 00:48:52.980
<v Speaker 4>reservation.</v>

1662
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1663
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.530
<v Speaker 4>One person who is just,</v>

1664
00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 4>she totally wrong about everything.</v>

1665
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1666
00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.230
<v Speaker 4>but 30 what was the,</v>

1667
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.390
<v Speaker 4>what was funny about his team or her?</v>

1668
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.231
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

1669
00:49:01.231 --> 00:49:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

1670
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.540
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read all the details of what they said,</v>

1671
00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:04.291
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1672
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1673
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.790
<v Speaker 4>they were just off on everything.</v>

1674
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:05.891
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1675
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:07.140
<v Speaker 4>no idea what machines were used.</v>

1676
00:49:07.141 --> 00:49:10.080
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea how many people were in the room had been an incredibly</v>

1677
00:49:10.081 --> 00:49:10.830
<v Speaker 4>accurate,</v>

1678
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.440
<v Speaker 4>35 of them were accurate count of how many phones?</v>

1679
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.180
<v Speaker 4>38.</v>

1680
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:14.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1681
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:15.503
<v Speaker 4>In their entirety.</v>

1682
00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Now the skeptical response to this is that the researchers themselves sort of a</v>

1683
00:49:21.111 --> 00:49:21.440
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1684
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:21.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1685
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.810
<v Speaker 4>would have suppressed information that wasn't accurate because they were so</v>

1686
00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:29.450
<v Speaker 4>blown away by what they were hearing that they went ahead and,</v>

1687
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:29.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1688
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.910
<v Speaker 4>only recorded sort of positive responses because the negative ones weren't</v>

1689
00:49:32.911 --> 00:49:35.670
<v Speaker 4>making any impact with them or weren't landing with them.</v>

1690
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.833
<v Speaker 4>And the other,</v>

1691
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1692
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:37.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1693
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.060
<v Speaker 4>the thing I'll propose is that,</v>

1694
00:49:39.061 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1695
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1696
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:41.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe</v>

1697
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty serious accusation and why,</v>

1698
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>why would they say that they have the questions and as all the,</v>

1699
00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.520
<v Speaker 1>everything's been recorded,</v>

1700
00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:47.354
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1701
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1702
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1703
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 4>we'd have to go back through every last study to figure out what,</v>

1704
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1705
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.830
<v Speaker 4>what research materials they had in every case.</v>

1706
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:53.251
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1707
00:49:53.251 --> 00:49:53.970
<v Speaker 4>that's just one,</v>

1708
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:54.721
<v Speaker 4>one objection.</v>

1709
00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:56.370
<v Speaker 4>They lodge any other objection in lounges that,</v>

1710
00:49:56.371 --> 00:49:56.820
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1711
00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 4>maybe they had some sort of anesthesia awareness,</v>

1712
00:49:59.461 --> 00:49:59.701
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1713
00:49:59.701 --> 00:49:59.931
<v Speaker 4>The Pr,</v>

1714
00:49:59.931 --> 00:50:01.170
<v Speaker 4>if the person wasn't anesthesia,</v>

1715
00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:03.270
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you're still aware of what's going on in the room.</v>

1716
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1717
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:04.970
<v Speaker 4>so they'll,</v>

1718
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.420
<v Speaker 4>they'll log that one in there too.</v>

1719
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.320
<v Speaker 4>Or they'll,</v>

1720
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.100
<v Speaker 4>they'll say that,</v>

1721
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:08.933
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1722
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.113
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1723
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.900
<v Speaker 4>they call it a PR profusion level of blood to the brain.</v>

1724
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they were getting cardiac massage and that does supply a certain amount of</v>

1725
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.641
<v Speaker 4>blood to your brain.</v>

1726
00:50:20.641 --> 00:50:21.440
<v Speaker 4>So maybe,</v>

1727
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:21.781
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1728
00:50:21.781 --> 00:50:24.930
<v Speaker 4>some part of the brain was still operating and able to retain a certain amount</v>

1729
00:50:24.931 --> 00:50:25.764
<v Speaker 4>of information,</v>

1730
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:26.910
<v Speaker 4>but it just,</v>

1731
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1732
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 4>these are possibilities.</v>

1733
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.290
<v Speaker 6>These are ideas</v>

1734
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 6>that maybe explain it,</v>

1735
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 6>but 35 out of 38,</v>

1736
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.550
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

1737
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1738
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.570
<v Speaker 6>it's remarkable and it's enough to push it into an area.</v>

1739
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:39.101
<v Speaker 6>And we have to say,</v>

1740
00:50:39.101 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1741
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 6>maybe something is going on here.</v>

1742
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:41.901
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1743
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 6>do you ever feel in a psychedelic experience that you get accurate information,</v>

1744
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 6>not just stuff that your mind is coming up with,</v>

1745
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 6>but some sort of signal or contact with something that's quote real?</v>

1746
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.980
<v Speaker 6>Will you believe that whether or not it's happening is the big debate,</v>

1747
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.300
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1748
00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1749
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.820
<v Speaker 6>there's people that absolutely believe that they're in contact with entities and</v>

1750
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:07.100
<v Speaker 6>there's other people that believe that you're just accessing the,</v>

1751
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:07.341
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1752
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:12.341
<v Speaker 6>the imagination and the mind is interfacing with distortion of its visual</v>

1753
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:18.611
<v Speaker 6>abilities in massive form and you're putting context to that and trying to make,</v>

1754
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.250
<v Speaker 6>make like rational understanding of it.</v>

1755
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 6>One of my favorite stories in the book,</v>

1756
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.060
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1757
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.371
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1758
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:26.810
<v Speaker 6>when I was researching and near death experience,</v>

1759
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:29.780
<v Speaker 6>I look pretty deeply in the story of Elizabeth Kubler Ross who wrote the book on</v>

1760
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:30.614
<v Speaker 6>death and dying,</v>

1761
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 6>which kind of galvanized the whole hospice movement and made end of life care in</v>

1762
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 6>this country and really around the world.</v>

1763
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.733
<v Speaker 6>A lot more humane.</v>

1764
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 6>And she is one of the first people ever to encounter the near death experience</v>

1765
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:45.440
<v Speaker 6>and she did it before that phrase was even coined.</v>

1766
00:51:45.441 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was Raymond Mooney wrote the book in 1975 she in the 60s was running</v>

1767
00:51:49.821 --> 00:51:52.110
<v Speaker 6>across patients in the hospital ward.</v>

1768
00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 6>She was a psychologist who are telling these same kinds of stories and when I</v>

1769
00:51:56.031 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 6>find really a couple layers to this when I get to you,</v>

1770
00:51:59.001 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 6>but what's really fascinating is she wanted to reject this stuff at first,</v>

1771
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 6>completely her research partner,</v>

1772
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:05.991
<v Speaker 6>the reverend,</v>

1773
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:06.261
<v Speaker 6>while I'm,</v>

1774
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:07.020
<v Speaker 6>we will Amara,</v>

1775
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 6>who is really terrific dude,</v>

1776
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:09.740
<v Speaker 6>I loved interviewing this guy.</v>

1777
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:10.610
<v Speaker 6>He's still around.</v>

1778
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 6>He was a reverend and he had been appointed to sort of go along on the hospital</v>

1779
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:16.130
<v Speaker 6>wards with her.</v>

1780
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.650
<v Speaker 6>What she was doing is very controversial.</v>

1781
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 6>Nobody talked to the terminally ill at that point.</v>

1782
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.960
<v Speaker 6>They were the sort of shunted off to the side and so the fact that she was doing</v>

1783
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 6>this was was really angering.</v>

1784
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the hospital staff.</v>

1785
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 6>So the administration put this reverend with her as a way of saying it,</v>

1786
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:33.480
<v Speaker 6>kind of giving her their blessing as a way of saying she's,</v>

1787
00:52:33.481 --> 00:52:33.591
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1788
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 6>she's not her alone.</v>

1789
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:35.061
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1790
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:35.570
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

1791
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 6>there's somebody with her and I would imagine Ramaro was pretty formidable,</v>

1792
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 6>so nobody wanted to fuck you over tomorrow because I met the guy,</v>

1793
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:43.724
<v Speaker 6>he's awesome.</v>

1794
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.713
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

1795
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 6>one of the early stories they encountered before they started even researching</v>

1796
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:51.500
<v Speaker 6>this experience because they'd hear these stories and kind of blow them off</v>

1797
00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 6>because they didn't know what to do with them.</v>

1798
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.013
<v Speaker 6>Finally,</v>

1799
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 6>he's out near the elevators.</v>

1800
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:59.450
<v Speaker 6>One day a woman goes into cardiac arrest.</v>

1801
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.501
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

1802
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 6>she's resuscitated right.</v>

1803
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:02.720
<v Speaker 6>Right there in the hall,</v>

1804
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.021
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1805
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 6>they went to work on it or they resuscitated her.</v>

1806
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 6>He goes to see her later and she starts describing the scene of what happened.</v>

1807
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1808
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 6>And she even describes that she was able in this stuff sounds ridiculous.</v>

1809
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1810
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:17.590
<v Speaker 6>But she was able to float in at one point behind a resident who was taking notes</v>

1811
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 6>because one of the things they did with,</v>

1812
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:20.641
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1813
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 6>if you've got an inexperienced doctor on the scene like that and there's an</v>

1814
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 6>emergency thing going on,</v>

1815
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.123
<v Speaker 6>they generally just don't</v>

1816
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 4>just take notes on what's going on.</v>

1817
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a way of giving them something to do and keeping them out of the way.</v>

1818
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 4>The people who really know what he's done right now and um,</v>

1819
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:39.050
<v Speaker 4>she was able to describe what he had previously doodled on the notepad that he</v>

1820
00:53:39.571 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 4>was now taking notes on her resuscitation on.</v>

1821
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:42.301
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1822
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Reverend Amara completely rejects this,</v>

1823
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:45.601
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1824
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:50.601
<v Speaker 4>He hears this and he thinks I'm going to prove you wrong because this doesn't</v>

1825
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:51.714
<v Speaker 4>fit his dogma.</v>

1826
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.000
<v Speaker 4>This is not what's supposed to happen when somebody dies.</v>

1827
00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1828
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:59.540
<v Speaker 4>So he goes and he finds the med student and he looks at the page of doodles or</v>

1829
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 4>the page of notes and it has some doodles and the doodles match with what she</v>

1830
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:06.024
<v Speaker 4>described.</v>

1831
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.630
<v Speaker 4>He asked the student if he never interfaced with this patient and all,</v>

1832
00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 4>they hadn't ain't asked the patient if they ever interface with students.</v>

1833
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:13.134
<v Speaker 4>She hadn't.</v>

1834
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.491
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1835
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 4>what we're left with now is we can say that Reverend Mwalimu Mara is lying.</v>

1836
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.530
<v Speaker 4>And I will never fucking say that because he wasn't right.</v>

1837
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1838
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 4>or we have a genuine mystery here and that's where I land.</v>

1839
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 4>There's a genuine mystery here.</v>

1840
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.760
<v Speaker 2>So th can one read about this?</v>

1841
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there obviously</v>

1842
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:32.540
<v Speaker 4>my book,</v>

1843
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.570
<v Speaker 4>this is completely in your book.</v>

1844
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.570
<v Speaker 4>The story is it was recorded anywhere else.</v>

1845
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1846
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1847
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.550
<v Speaker 4>intriguingly,</v>

1848
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1849
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.990
<v Speaker 4>Kubler Ross herself wrote about it.</v>

1850
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

1851
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is great a detail as I ended up doing it through a Mara,</v>

1852
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:47.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1853
00:54:47.771 --> 00:54:48.604
<v Speaker 4>because she had,</v>

1854
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.740
<v Speaker 4>so what happens is they have this event happened there really shaken by it and</v>

1855
00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:54.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1856
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.340
<v Speaker 4>but they also are noticing that the patients who are reporting these experiences</v>

1857
00:54:57.341 --> 00:54:58.174
<v Speaker 4>are changing.</v>

1858
00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.910
<v Speaker 4>They are no longer afraid to die.</v>

1859
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:01.121
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1860
00:55:01.121 --> 00:55:05.380
<v Speaker 4>you've got to imagine the anxiety that you would confront a terminal diagnosis</v>

1861
00:55:05.381 --> 00:55:06.400
<v Speaker 4>with these people.</v>

1862
00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Start losing that anxiety and start wanting to talk to her about,</v>

1863
00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:10.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1864
00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:11.170
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1865
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:14.260
<v Speaker 4>I want to clean up my relationships before I go.</v>

1866
00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.250
<v Speaker 4>They start talking to live in hard and the time they have left rather than</v>

1867
00:55:18.251 --> 00:55:20.650
<v Speaker 4>trembling at the fact that they're going to pass on.</v>

1868
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.121
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1869
00:55:21.121 --> 00:55:22.780
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge dramatic effect.</v>

1870
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's when they decided to start taking notes.</v>

1871
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Like this whole idea that the near death experiences merely wishful thinking is</v>

1872
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:30.963
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>

1873
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1874
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:34.120
<v Speaker 4>and it's at least bullshitting in her experience at a Mara,</v>

1875
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.990
<v Speaker 4>his experience of it,</v>

1876
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:39.250
<v Speaker 4>they rejected it till they really couldn't reject it anymore because here they</v>

1877
00:55:39.251 --> 00:55:41.650
<v Speaker 4>are researching what happens when you're terminally ill.</v>

1878
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.390
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that was coming up,</v>

1879
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1880
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.830
<v Speaker 4>in dozens of cases where people who were losing their fear because of this</v>

1881
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:48.220
<v Speaker 4>event,</v>

1882
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.070
<v Speaker 4>and that's how they ended up justifying doing any research on it at all.</v>

1883
00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.630
<v Speaker 4>So when she wrote her book,</v>

1884
00:55:52.631 --> 00:55:54.070
<v Speaker 4>she had a lot of different stories to tell.</v>

1885
00:55:54.071 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she hit that story as hard as she should have.</v>

1886
00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1887
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1888
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:03.240
<v Speaker 2>the near death experience being created or being facilitated maybe is a better</v>

1889
00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:05.041
<v Speaker 2>word by,</v>

1890
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1891
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.700
<v Speaker 2>by a psychedelic experience by the brain producing chemicals is,</v>

1892
00:56:09.701 --> 00:56:10.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1893
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:10.661
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1894
00:56:10.661 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1895
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.960
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that there isn't something still going on.</v>

1896
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:17.800
<v Speaker 2>It might mean that that's a chemical gateway to whatever's going on and that's</v>

1897
00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:22.801
<v Speaker 2>how the brain can release is this stuff and it interfaces with whatever the fuck</v>

1898
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:24.290
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

1899
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:25.250
<v Speaker 1>When you have these trips,</v>

1900
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a researcher,</v>

1901
00:56:26.271 --> 00:56:27.260
<v Speaker 4>are you familiar with them?</v>

1902
00:56:27.261 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 4>I remember their last is a Carhart Harris.</v>

1903
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.780
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1904
00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.613
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1905
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:32.360
<v Speaker 4>he did a study on,</v>

1906
00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.253
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1907
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:34.161
<v Speaker 4>well mushrooms,</v>

1908
00:56:34.161 --> 00:56:36.080
<v Speaker 4>the active ingredient in mushrooms,</v>

1909
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1910
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.880
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>

1911
00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1912
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.730
<v Speaker 4>psilocybin and he,</v>

1913
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:41.923
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1914
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 4>he found that it seemed to suppress a brain activity.</v>

1915
00:56:47.451 --> 00:56:49.130
<v Speaker 4>The brain actually seemed less active,</v>

1916
00:56:49.131 --> 00:56:51.350
<v Speaker 4>particularly the parts of the brain responsible for,</v>

1917
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:52.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1918
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:55.760
<v Speaker 4>making connections and relaying information from one spot to another.</v>

1919
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.280
<v Speaker 4>What he thought was really interesting about that,</v>

1921
00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 4>and I would tend to agree with them,</v>

1922
00:56:59.420 --> 00:56:59.661
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

1923
00:56:59.661 --> 00:57:04.340
<v Speaker 4>you would think at moments of heightened experience and heightened perception</v>

1924
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.080
<v Speaker 4>that we would see an excitement in the brain,</v>

1925
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:09.500
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1926
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1927
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.330
<v Speaker 4>greater activity.</v>

1928
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.760
<v Speaker 4>Well here he was seeing a diminished activity,</v>

1929
00:57:13.761 --> 00:57:16.280
<v Speaker 4>less activity and it calls,</v>

1930
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.970
<v Speaker 4>he called me back anyway to the idea that a lot of what the brain does is filter</v>

1931
00:57:19.971 --> 00:57:20.810
<v Speaker 4>our experience.</v>

1932
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.500
<v Speaker 4>A lot of our processing is unconscious information.</v>

1933
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.660
<v Speaker 4>We're picking up from the environment all the time.</v>

1934
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.520
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't rise into our awareness,</v>

1935
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.400
<v Speaker 4>our brains making the decision for us as to whether or not we need to be,</v>

1936
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:31.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1937
00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.220
<v Speaker 4>worried about that little noise behind us for the creaking,</v>

1938
00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:35.270
<v Speaker 4>the chair's making or whatever.</v>

1939
00:57:35.271 --> 00:57:35.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1940
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:38.840
<v Speaker 4>we don't even register it necessarily consciously.</v>

1941
00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.990
<v Speaker 4>And so the question becomes when you take this chemical,</v>

1942
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.960
<v Speaker 4>which I may or may not be interested in taking myself,</v>

1943
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:46.430
<v Speaker 4>I think we might be interested in it.</v>

1944
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:46.881
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1945
00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:47.900
<v Speaker 4>I think I might be,</v>

1946
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.060
<v Speaker 4>when you take this chemical,</v>

1947
00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:54.560
<v Speaker 4>are you actually stopping the brain from filtering so much information?</v>

1948
00:57:54.561 --> 00:57:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Are you actually accessing more of the raw data that's out there?</v>

1949
00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:58.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1950
00:57:58.191 --> 00:57:58.940
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1951
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.530
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting question.</v>

1952
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.543
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

1953
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:02.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1954
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the mushroom experience is that the mushroom experience actually</v>

1955
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:10.160
<v Speaker 1>mirrors Norman,</v>

1956
00:58:10.161 --> 00:58:10.400
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

1957
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.320
<v Speaker 1>normal human near neurochemistry.</v>

1958
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.221
<v Speaker 1>Part of,</v>

1959
00:58:13.221 --> 00:58:13.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1960
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 1>what makes up a mushroom is an,</v>

1961
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.940
<v Speaker 1>and dimethyltryptamine you mean the same stuff that you bring produces or your</v>

1962
00:58:19.941 --> 00:58:21.110
<v Speaker 1>lungs and your liver.</v>

1963
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.550
<v Speaker 1>They know that the human body produces it and it's been thought that the pineal</v>

1964
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:25.881
<v Speaker 1>gland,</v>

1965
00:58:25.881 --> 00:58:28.790
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get very angry if you're not at the very specific about this</v>

1966
00:58:28.791 --> 00:58:29.210
<v Speaker 1>cause they,</v>

1967
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just anecdotal evidence that the pineal gland,</v>

1968
00:58:32.181 --> 00:58:34.460
<v Speaker 1>which is the third eye of eastern mysticism,</v>

1969
00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:37.040
<v Speaker 1>producers this whatever produces it,</v>

1970
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever they find one day,</v>

1971
00:58:38.961 --> 00:58:41.360
<v Speaker 1>ultimately they believe it's the pineal gland,</v>

1972
00:58:41.361 --> 00:58:45.380
<v Speaker 1>but you got to cut people's brains open within like a certain amount of time</v>

1973
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>while they're dead and then extract it to see if it's like,</v>

1974
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:49.281
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1975
00:58:49.281 --> 00:58:51.860
<v Speaker 1>it would have been intense I think to find,</v>

1976
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.480
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to find better ways to,</v>

1977
00:58:53.481 --> 00:58:53.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1978
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:54.583
<v Speaker 1>to measure.</v>

1979
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:59.480
<v Speaker 1>But the most important thing is it's unquestionably produced in the body.</v>

1980
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So the body is unquestionably producing this incredibly potent human neuro</v>

1981
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:04.971
<v Speaker 1>transmitter,</v>

1982
00:59:04.971 --> 00:59:08.420
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the ingredients of mushrooms.</v>

1983
00:59:08.421 --> 00:59:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Like psilocybin mushroom is something like four Fox oarlock say n and</v>

1984
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.420
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

1985
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And I know I,</v>

1986
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up the first part the way you say it,</v>

1987
00:59:17.361 --> 00:59:18.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1988
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:18.621
<v Speaker 1>it's and,</v>

1989
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.810
<v Speaker 1>and dimethyl trip team with something tagged on.</v>

1990
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And my point is that people that take mushrooms have the exact same sort of</v>

1991
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:31.841
<v Speaker 1>feeling when it comes to that without the near death sort of um,</v>

1992
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>connotation to it that they will die,</v>

1993
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 1>but they have the feeling like they have to clean up relationships.</v>

1994
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>They have the feeling like they want to live like right now with joy and</v>

1995
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:42.464
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

1996
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a very religious experience for a lot of people and a lot of scholars</v>

1997
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 1>actually believe it's the origin of religious experience and you know about the</v>

1998
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety research going on there right now too,</v>

1999
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2000
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:52.851
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2001
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2002
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2003
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2004
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic stuff.</v>

2005
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.860
<v Speaker 1>If I do a fringe ology to which I intend to,</v>

2006
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I intend to look pretty deeply into deeply like as in you're going to take them.</v>

2007
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to look.</v>

2009
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I do emersion journalism.</v>

2010
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I debated like,</v>

2011
01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>am I going to be coy or not?</v>

2012
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>But like I do emersion journalism,</v>

2013
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.751
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

2014
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I get into what I'm reporting on as much as I can.</v>

2015
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a psychedelic experiences are very,</v>

2016
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:18.464
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>

2017
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>They can certainly send you off a path and to the nutty land,</v>

2018
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're very helpful and they're probably part of what's made us</v>

2019
01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>humans in the first place.</v>

2020
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2021
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>every single religion has some sort of substance that they,</v>

2022
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2023
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>they talk about whether it's monetary,</v>

2024
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.331
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

2025
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2026
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Soma,</v>

2027
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2028
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>there's like so many of them throughout which are clearly some sort of</v>

2029
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:45.551
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic entheogenic they would take and ritual form and help them connect to</v>

2030
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2031
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It might have aided evolution in some way.</v>

2032
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2034
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2035
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>The Terence Mckenna stoned ape theory is a fascinating,</v>

2036
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>fascinating idea and it's,</v>

2037
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2038
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>it's really one of those who the fuck knows things.</v>

2039
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to go back and try to figure out what the hell happened.</v>

2040
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>That turned us from,</v>

2041
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:01.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2042
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:06.431
<v Speaker 1>some sort of monkey type creature in ape of a lower age to however it became a</v>

2043
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:08.744
<v Speaker 1>human Ming.</v>

2044
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>

2045
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I think in general we need to be willing to say who the fuck knows more often.</v>

2046
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Well if you do mushrooms,</v>

2047
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>it should say who the fuck knows all day.</v>

2048
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you do it you're just going to go,</v>

2049
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2050
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>how could I have known that that's there.</v>

2051
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>How did you know?</v>

2052
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And that DMT is mushrooms times a million plus aliens.</v>

2053
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's impossible to even wrap a word around it and all those things can uh,</v>

2054
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>they can change you just like a religious experience could change you.</v>

2055
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>They can also freak you the fuck out and make you think you're haunted.</v>

2056
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Like afterward we can,</v>

2057
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.333
<v Speaker 1>you can lose,</v>

2058
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you could blow a fuse.</v>

2059
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of possible for a lot of people just do too much.</v>

2060
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all about the situation or yourself and find,</v>

2061
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.213
<v Speaker 1>do you find that,</v>

2062
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would take it with so much excitement at this point,</v>

2063
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>like just so much like you would,</v>

2064
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>let's do it,</v>

2065
01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're not crazy.</v>

2066
01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>You're a successful author.</v>

2067
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>He seemed like a nice guy.</v>

2068
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're a naughty person and ingest that shit,</v>

2069
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>if you're barely hanging on to sanity,</v>

2070
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

2071
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

2072
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>What was dis what,</v>

2073
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2074
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>what was the most shocking find for you in the writing of this book?</v>

2075
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2076
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2077
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>what's the one thing that set you back and really made you go,</v>

2078
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2079
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 4>I might've started with the telepathy,</v>

2080
01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:23.230
<v Speaker 4>but the other thing was meaning,</v>

2081
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:23.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2082
01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Ricky soils in Stephenville,</v>

2083
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>

2084
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.431
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>

2085
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2086
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:31.370
<v Speaker 4>one of the witnesses to what became known and Ufo circles is a,</v>

2087
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 4>the Stevenville lights this January 8th,</v>

2088
01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 4>I think 2008,</v>

2089
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2090
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.100
<v Speaker 4>citing and a soils,</v>

2091
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:39.600
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>

2092
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 4>so on January 8th,</v>

2093
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 4>dozens of people I like to say they had the misfortune of looking out because,</v>

2094
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2095
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 4>they face a lot of heat after they reported what they saw.</v>

2096
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2097
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 4>but it was some kind of,</v>

2098
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.573
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2099
01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 4>series of lights in the sky that moved in,</v>

2100
01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 4>such with such a unity that it seemed to be one craft would have been very,</v>

2101
01:02:59.041 --> 01:02:59.874
<v Speaker 4>very big.</v>

2102
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2103
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.400
<v Speaker 4>at what point it was actually trailed by,</v>

2104
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Speaker 4>have sixteens that couldn't catch up to it.</v>

2105
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:05.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2106
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2107
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 4>these were the sorts of reports you're getting at as Steven belt at the time.</v>

2108
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:14.750
<v Speaker 4>And Ricky came forward to the newspaper and said that he had seen something many</v>

2109
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 4>weeks before.</v>

2110
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.671
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2111
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:22.671
<v Speaker 4>I think it was shortly after Thanksgiving and it was a solo daytime siding and</v>

2112
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 4>it was the wildest story of all the stories and ever for told me.</v>

2113
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:28.111
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2114
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:28.921
<v Speaker 4>And in relation to the book,</v>

2115
01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:31.980
<v Speaker 4>this was probably the wildest and part of that had to do with the,</v>

2116
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 4>with Ricky himself.</v>

2117
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to tell me the story.</v>

2118
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I had to go through an intermediary who talked him into ultimately speaking to</v>

2119
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2120
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 4>As far as I'm aware,</v>

2121
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 4>he has not done another interview since,</v>

2122
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:45.780
<v Speaker 4>and we're now looking at three and a half years since I spoke to him.</v>

2123
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 4>He made not a dime on this,</v>

2124
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2125
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:50.251
<v Speaker 4>if anything,</v>

2126
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 4>he just faced a lot of ridicule,</v>

2127
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:52.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2128
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.670
<v Speaker 4>locally in Stephenville first.</v>

2129
01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:55.680
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2130
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 4>except of course from the people who'd seen it or had a loved one see it.</v>

2131
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:59.543
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2132
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 4>so he has the siding,</v>

2133
01:04:00.721 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 4>he's out hunting.</v>

2134
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the things that people use to sort of subtly undermine him.</v>

2135
01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:06.331
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2136
01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:06.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2137
01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.550
<v Speaker 4>in the same way that Monica Lewinsky was sort of framed for all of America by</v>

2138
01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:12.270
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the dress that ended up with a semen stain came from the gap,</v>

2139
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:13.111
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2140
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 4>So we now we know where she shops.</v>

2141
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Like she's this low rent little girl.</v>

2142
01:04:16.341 --> 01:04:16.740
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>

2143
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.510
<v Speaker 4>That's how people did her end.</v>

2144
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2145
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2146
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:21.121
<v Speaker 4>with Ricky,</v>

2147
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 4>one of the things people like to report sort of demean him is that we call him a</v>

2148
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:25.314
<v Speaker 4>deer hunter,</v>

2149
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2150
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.641
<v Speaker 4>He's a father.</v>

2151
01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:27.451
<v Speaker 4>He's a machinist.</v>

2152
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 4>He's had his job for 15,</v>

2153
01:04:28.591 --> 01:04:29.401
<v Speaker 4>20 years.</v>

2154
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 4>You mean he's a lot more than the deer hunter,</v>

2155
01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but he was out hunting deer when this happened.</v>

2156
01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Why did they think that that's somehow or another get located him as a hick?</v>

2157
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2158
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.461
<v Speaker 4>He's in Stephenville,</v>

2159
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:38.821
<v Speaker 4>Texas,</v>

2160
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>which is literally a cow town.</v>

2161
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:42.570
<v Speaker 4>You were talking before about the cowboy with kerosene games.</v>

2162
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:43.920
<v Speaker 4>These are cowboys.</v>

2163
01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 4>These are people who are raising cattle,</v>

2164
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2165
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:46.860
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2166
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2167
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.040
<v Speaker 4>the cliche of,</v>

2168
01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 4>of Ufo sightings is that it's,</v>

2169
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 4>it's quoted six.</v>

2170
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 4>See them,</v>

2171
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2172
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:53.791
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2173
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:54.624
<v Speaker 4>one of the cliches.</v>

2174
01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.773
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

2175
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2176
01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Ricky's out deer hunting and he trips over a branch and he doesn't fall down,</v>

2177
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 4>but he has to know sort of steady himself and he glances up and he notices</v>

2178
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:06.811
<v Speaker 4>overhead.</v>

2179
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Now something he ended up saying it was 300 feet over his head.</v>

2180
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:15.960
<v Speaker 4>He gauged this by the fact that there's a water tower in the community that is</v>

2181
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>300 feet high and it seemed about the same height.</v>

2182
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 6>He cannot see an edge to whatever it is that's floating above him.</v>

2183
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 6>And it's not making any sound,</v>

2184
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.740
<v Speaker 6>but it is hanging over the trees.</v>

2185
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 6>And in it there are this series of sort of inverted cones,</v>

2186
01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:36.550
<v Speaker 6>which he intuitively suspected must be part of the propulsion propulsion system.</v>

2187
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.380
<v Speaker 6>So the narrow part is up further into the craft and then it widens as it</v>

2188
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:41.171
<v Speaker 6>telescopes down.</v>

2189
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2190
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 6>And so there's these series of inverted cones and his first instinct,</v>

2191
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 6>and I think people use this to sort of position him to his first instinct was to</v>

2192
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 6>put his gun on it,</v>

2193
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 6>but put his sight on it,</v>

2194
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2195
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.530
<v Speaker 6>Just instinct.</v>

2196
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.513
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that?</v>

2197
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:54.870
<v Speaker 6>I've got,</v>

2198
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:55.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2199
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 6>he was pointing the gun at it and then quickly within a second or two,</v>

2200
01:05:58.871 --> 01:05:59.704
<v Speaker 6>realize,</v>

2201
01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.713
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2202
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to shoot it,</v>

2203
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:02.501
<v Speaker 6>this thing,</v>

2204
01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:03.191
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>

2205
01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to shoot at it.</v>

2206
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.440
<v Speaker 6>And so he,</v>

2207
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 6>he lowers his gun and in room telling me about this,</v>

2208
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 6>that he just told himself,</v>

2209
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 6>calm down.</v>

2210
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 6>Remember as much of this as you can.</v>

2211
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.170
<v Speaker 6>Just look at it,</v>

2212
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.303
<v Speaker 6>take it in.</v>

2213
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.160
<v Speaker 6>And then whom,</v>

2214
01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:17.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2215
01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.990
<v Speaker 6>I forget exactly how long he was looking at it,</v>

2216
01:06:19.991 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 6>but for a little while and it just shot off and it went so fast.</v>

2217
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

2218
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 6>there's no word for this kind of speed.</v>

2219
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 6>There's no word that can describe this kind of speed.</v>

2220
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:33.190
<v Speaker 6>It went from being blocking my entire field division because it was so big to</v>

2221
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 6>just shooting up into the air.</v>

2222
01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2223
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2224
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.750
<v Speaker 6>like a lightning flash was so convincing to you about his story.</v>

2225
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.051
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2226
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 6>here's what was here was the convincing part.</v>

2227
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:43.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2228
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm used to sitting across from people and having me,</v>

2229
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.211
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2230
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 6>and having them tell me all kinds of information.</v>

2231
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.443
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2232
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 6>and I have to look at various tells and just sort of see how I feel about them.</v>

2233
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:54.041
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2234
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:54.874
<v Speaker 6>Are they telling the truth?</v>

2235
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Speaker 6>Ricky just seemed utterly,</v>

2236
01:06:58.061 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 6>completely truthful.</v>

2237
01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:00.990
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't getting nothing from this,</v>

2238
01:07:00.991 --> 01:07:01.740
<v Speaker 6>that the,</v>

2239
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2240
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 6>obviously the skeptics point of view,</v>

2241
01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:05.680
<v Speaker 6>the cynics can come in and go,</v>

2242
01:07:05.681 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 6>what if he was crazy?</v>

2243
01:07:06.611 --> 01:07:07.780
<v Speaker 6>What if he's a good liar?</v>

2244
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.520
<v Speaker 6>You're basing your belief off.</v>

2245
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 6>This is the most shocking thing.</v>

2246
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 6>An anecdotal story from a good liar.</v>

2247
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.751
<v Speaker 6>Well like I said,</v>

2248
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:15.040
<v Speaker 6>I want to start with the telepathy actually.</v>

2249
01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 6>Cause I could look at that research myself in judge it.</v>

2250
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:17.230
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2251
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:18.051
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2252
01:07:18.051 --> 01:07:18.884
<v Speaker 6>he freaked you out.</v>

2253
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 6>He freaked me out in this sense because here's the thing,</v>

2254
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:21.580
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

2255
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:21.911
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>

2256
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 6>he is demonstrably not crazy.</v>

2257
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 6>He's fully functional.</v>

2258
01:07:24.401 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 6>He's still got the same job.</v>

2259
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.350
<v Speaker 6>He's still got the same friends you go drinking with them.</v>

2260
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.840
<v Speaker 6>I actually met him for lunch when we could have a beer or two and just hammered.</v>

2261
01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 6>You don't know the dude and unless you've seen him hammered,</v>

2262
01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 6>you don't know my wife and kids and he's got a whole life.</v>

2263
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:40.830
<v Speaker 6>I was running that line.</v>

2264
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.910
<v Speaker 6>The fucking Ted Haggard,</v>

2265
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 6>the guy,</v>

2266
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 6>the church Guy Smokes meth.</v>

2267
01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 6>And so interesting to me about a story like that.</v>

2268
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:52.510
<v Speaker 6>What we're left with is the idea that what we have to say as well,</v>

2269
01:07:52.511 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 6>he must,</v>

2270
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 6>he must be crazy.</v>

2271
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 6>Something must be off right with him.</v>

2272
01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.560
<v Speaker 6>What was it people saw several weeks later?</v>

2273
01:07:59.561 --> 01:07:59.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2274
01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that interests me about that story is they were very near a</v>

2275
01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 6>military base and in,</v>

2276
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:04.991
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

2277
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:05.771
<v Speaker 6>this is all in the book,</v>

2278
01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 6>but one of the things that happened to him after he reported his signing as he</v>

2279
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 6>started getting calls from somebody who was identifying themselves as a member</v>

2280
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:13.564
<v Speaker 6>of the military,</v>

2281
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 6>who is advising him not to about this anymore and saying</v>

2282
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.993
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to meet with him.</v>

2283
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.710
<v Speaker 4>That was me.</v>

2284
01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:18.543
<v Speaker 2>I was calling.</v>

2285
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.811
<v Speaker 2>I'll just try and get,</v>

2286
01:08:19.811 --> 01:08:19.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2287
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>get them to come on the podcast.</v>

2288
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:22.770
<v Speaker 2>It was Robert Deniro.</v>

2289
01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I was rehearsing my role and you're all,</v>

2290
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2291
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2292
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:29.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2293
01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I wish he just pulled out his phone and took a picture of that would have been</v>

2294
01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:34.270
<v Speaker 2>half one mother fucker out there.</v>

2295
01:08:34.271 --> 01:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>To your hunting without a phone.</v>

2296
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.653
<v Speaker 2>A funny part about it,</v>

2297
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:38.850
<v Speaker 4>this one of the witnesses,</v>

2298
01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.560
<v Speaker 4>a constable,</v>

2299
01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:41.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2300
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:42.270
<v Speaker 4>that's what they call their sheriff there.</v>

2301
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2302
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.003
<v Speaker 4>Leroy Gaten,</v>

2303
01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:44.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2304
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Had a camera nearby when he had his siding,</v>

2305
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:52.550
<v Speaker 4>it was in his car and he was 10 feet from his car and he had to make a choice.</v>

2306
01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Do I take my eyes off this unbelievable sight and miss it or do I go grab the</v>

2307
01:08:57.961 --> 01:08:58.590
<v Speaker 4>camera?</v>

2308
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:01.350
<v Speaker 4>And his choice was to stay rooted to the spot.</v>

2309
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.603
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2310
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.290
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's another thing where I just sort of cautioned the</v>

2311
01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:05.701
<v Speaker 4>skeptics.</v>

2312
01:09:05.701 --> 01:09:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the end of the day,</v>

2313
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:07.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2314
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.010
<v Speaker 4>what they saw in Stephenville is an unidentified flying object.</v>

2315
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.190
<v Speaker 4>And we ended up with believers who hear that and say,</v>

2316
01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.090
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what it was.</v>

2317
01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Therefore aliens.</v>

2318
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's ridiculous.</v>

2319
01:09:17.371 --> 01:09:17.880
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2320
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 4>But we also ended with skeptics.</v>

2321
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.180
<v Speaker 4>You want to explain it away as flares.</v>

2322
01:09:21.181 --> 01:09:23.970
<v Speaker 4>And you know what that's equally fricking ridiculous</v>

2323
01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:26.910
<v Speaker 2>was you said fricken and then I'm like,</v>

2324
01:09:26.911 --> 01:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

2325
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.560
<v Speaker 2>we're grown adults here.</v>

2326
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Fucking thank you.</v>

2327
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you heard Brian,</v>

2328
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.270
<v Speaker 2>and this is the first podcast I've been on where like swearing is just like</v>

2329
01:09:36.271 --> 01:09:36.660
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2330
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2331
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2332
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:38.071
<v Speaker 2>The other one,</v>

2333
01:09:38.071 --> 01:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>it's always where maybe Matt doesn't disinfect and I didn't realize it,</v>

2334
01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:42.541
<v Speaker 2>but the other ones,</v>

2335
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:43.374
<v Speaker 2>they're clean.</v>

2336
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:43.591
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2337
01:09:43.591 --> 01:09:44.880
<v Speaker 2>If you listened to them then they're clean.</v>

2338
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.940
<v Speaker 2>We fucking square our asses off.</v>

2339
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:48.631
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2340
01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I swear all the fucking time.</v>

2341
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2342
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:52.080
<v Speaker 2>but I'm used to in this setting.</v>

2343
01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:53.010
<v Speaker 2>That'd be cool if,</v>

2344
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:55.170
<v Speaker 2>do you have photos where Bigfoot's instead of ships,</v>

2345
01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:55.801
<v Speaker 2>they're just flying.</v>

2346
01:09:55.801 --> 01:09:56.634
<v Speaker 2>They clients.</v>

2347
01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.393
<v Speaker 2>Well remember</v>

2348
01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a joke that if there was going to be Ufo is why would they come</v>

2349
01:10:04.561 --> 01:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>in the form of a disc if they can get here from another planet,</v>

2350
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>they could make themselves look a cloud like that's something we've already</v>

2351
01:10:10.981 --> 01:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to do with like those Japanese jackets that show you an image of</v>

2352
01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:17.190
<v Speaker 2>what's behind you on you.</v>

2353
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that there are people new technology,</v>

2354
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.660
<v Speaker 2>there are people actually who do claim they come here.</v>

2355
01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:22.494
<v Speaker 2>It's clouds.</v>

2356
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2357
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh well I have a problem.</v>

2358
01:10:24.901 --> 01:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's got a problem rather,</v>

2359
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2360
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he was nutty and uh,</v>

2361
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:31.320
<v Speaker 2>we were in the Improv one night and he's like,</v>

2362
01:10:31.321 --> 01:10:31.951
<v Speaker 2>check these out.</v>

2363
01:10:31.951 --> 01:10:34.980
<v Speaker 2>And he started showing me pictures of clouds and I go,</v>

2364
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:35.191
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:36.001
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2367
01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2368
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.550
<v Speaker 2>he's on his iPhone showing me pictures of clouds cause you know,</v>

2369
01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>they're out there all the time.</v>

2370
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:40.290
<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>

2371
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.310
<v Speaker 2>they're following me all the time.</v>

2372
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.473
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2373
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:42.901
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2374
01:10:42.901 --> 01:10:44.250
<v Speaker 2>what exactly are you saying?</v>

2375
01:10:44.251 --> 01:10:44.611
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2376
01:10:44.611 --> 01:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>these are flying saucers.</v>

2377
01:10:45.721 --> 01:10:45.961
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2378
01:10:45.961 --> 01:10:47.910
<v Speaker 2>these are from another planet because they're out there,</v>

2379
01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>they're falling all the time.</v>

2380
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:49.883
<v Speaker 2>And I realized,</v>

2381
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2382
01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:52.020
<v Speaker 2>I thought this dude was just nutty.</v>

2383
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was like a nutty comic and no,</v>

2384
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:55.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2385
01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:56.141
<v Speaker 2>he's got something,</v>

2386
01:10:56.141 --> 01:10:56.974
<v Speaker 2>somethings,</v>

2387
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.230
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2388
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:03.230
<v Speaker 2>a is connected to B and B is hanging down here loose and sparking and are</v>

2389
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.620
<v Speaker 2>smoking aliens.</v>

2390
01:11:04.621 --> 01:11:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2391
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.970
<v Speaker 4>I totally met people who are so invested in this idea that they're being,</v>

2392
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.863
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2393
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2394
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 4>they've been abducted or if they're,</v>

2395
01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:13.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2396
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:14.051
<v Speaker 4>visited by aliens.</v>

2397
01:11:14.051 --> 01:11:19.051
<v Speaker 4>I met a guy who claimed to have an implant in his leg and he didn't want it</v>

2398
01:11:19.091 --> 01:11:22.390
<v Speaker 4>removed because the times that he's thought about it,</v>

2399
01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:26.080
<v Speaker 4>he began to feel nauseous and this made him think that the,</v>

2400
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2401
01:11:26.621 --> 01:11:31.621
<v Speaker 4>the aliens don't want him to have it removed and just this whole trip into lots</v>

2402
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.290
<v Speaker 4>of New Zealand because there's a lump under his skin.</v>

2403
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.323
<v Speaker 4>Right and right.</v>

2404
01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.310
<v Speaker 4>And that could be glass that's been working its way up.</v>

2405
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:40.301
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean,</v>

2406
01:11:40.301 --> 01:11:42.280
<v Speaker 4>for decades or who knows what the fuck it is.</v>

2407
01:11:42.281 --> 01:11:42.481
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2408
01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 4>It like some kind of growth and um,</v>

2409
01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 4>so I definitely</v>

2410
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:46.281
<v Speaker 1>met people like that.</v>

2411
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's one of the things that impressed me so much about Ricky.</v>

2412
01:11:48.801 --> 01:11:49.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2413
01:11:49.011 --> 01:11:49.520
<v Speaker 1>As he's,</v>

2414
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to give the interview.</v>

2415
01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:53.930
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't done another interview since there's no profit in it for him.</v>

2416
01:11:53.931 --> 01:11:54.441
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

2417
01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>he just faced embarrassment over this.</v>

2418
01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2419
01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I wish a story was enough for me,</v>

2420
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.030
<v Speaker 1>but I still have an open mind.</v>

2421
01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I still have an open mind because even though I know that most people are full</v>

2422
01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>of shit,</v>

2423
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I still know that we can send a rover to Mars if we can send a rover to Mars,</v>

2424
01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>if there was a,</v>

2425
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:15.860
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a civilization out there that wasn't just a thousand years advance,</v>

2426
01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but millions of years advance and perhaps they live in a solar system that</v>

2427
01:12:21.621 --> 01:12:24.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get pelted by asteroids every couple of hundred million years and wipes</v>

2428
01:12:24.681 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 1>out everything on the planet.</v>

2429
01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2430
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows what level of achievement they've had technologically.</v>

2431
01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.090
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely possible.</v>

2432
01:12:32.091 --> 01:12:33.350
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys I write about in the book,</v>

2433
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.730
<v Speaker 1>a Doctor Edgar Mitchell</v>

2434
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 4>now's astronauts,</v>

2435
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.790
<v Speaker 4>his family in a hundred years,</v>

2436
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 4>if you just sort of trace this blood bloodline,</v>

2437
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 4>they moved west in a horse drawn wagons and then he was on the moon a hundred</v>

2438
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:53.580
<v Speaker 4>years later that that's technology advancing from a horse drawn wagons to the</v>

2439
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:53.760
<v Speaker 4>moon.</v>

2440
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2441
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:57.070
<v Speaker 1>well he's a big UFO believer.</v>

2442
01:12:57.071 --> 01:13:00.970
<v Speaker 1>He's actually said that he saw some things when he was in space.</v>

2443
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:01.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2444
01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:01.900
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2445
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.300
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2446
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:02.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2447
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:02.671
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2448
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:02.861
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2449
01:13:02.861 --> 01:13:04.570
<v Speaker 4>not in relation to Ufo is at all.</v>

2450
01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:07.690
<v Speaker 4>He said he maintains that he saw nothing in terms of Ufo.</v>

2451
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:09.430
<v Speaker 4>She had a huge,</v>

2452
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:11.290
<v Speaker 4>he does believe in Ufos.</v>

2453
01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:13.720
<v Speaker 4>He says he's talked to members of the military since he was shorter than that.</v>

2454
01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:15.290
<v Speaker 4>There that Ufo is,</v>

2455
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:18.100
<v Speaker 4>should be identified as alien craft and some cases right,</v>

2456
01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:18.211
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2457
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:19.180
<v Speaker 4>that we are being visited.</v>

2458
01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.820
<v Speaker 4>But what happened in space was completely different.</v>

2459
01:13:21.821 --> 01:13:22.100
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2460
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.950
<v Speaker 4>it was a religious or a spiritual,</v>

2461
01:13:23.951 --> 01:13:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I'll say spiritual experience.</v>

2462
01:13:25.511 --> 01:13:26.270
<v Speaker 4>He had,</v>

2463
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2464
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.520
<v Speaker 4>an epiphany where he had the same sort of experience that people report in</v>

2465
01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:36.541
<v Speaker 4>meditation when they hit this kind of bliss or sometimes on psychedelics where</v>

2466
01:13:38.741 --> 01:13:43.741
<v Speaker 4>it was like everything dropped away and he felt himself being at one with the</v>

2467
01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:45.520
<v Speaker 4>entire universe,</v>

2468
01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.050
<v Speaker 4>that everything was connected,</v>

2469
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.000
<v Speaker 4>everything was one thing.</v>

2470
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.510
<v Speaker 4>And it was a feeling that he had all the way back.</v>

2471
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:52.871
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2472
01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:53.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2473
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:55.870
<v Speaker 4>over a period of a day or two,</v>

2474
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.150
<v Speaker 4>he would have this experience every,</v>

2475
01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:58.661
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

2476
01:13:58.661 --> 01:13:59.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2477
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:00.063
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2478
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:01.183
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2479
01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2480
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.080
<v Speaker 4>regularly feel this sense of wonder and the sense that he was,</v>

2481
01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:08.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2482
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:10.320
<v Speaker 4>he rejected his parents' religion.</v>

2483
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:15.330
<v Speaker 4>He'd gone down the science path and it completely altered his perspective.</v>

2484
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And made him think that there's some way of uniting spirituality and science.</v>

2485
01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:21.750
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2486
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.980
<v Speaker 4>he landed and started the institute of noetic sciences to try and find some sort</v>

2487
01:14:25.981 --> 01:14:29.820
<v Speaker 4>of connection between spiritual experiences and um,</v>

2488
01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2489
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.650
<v Speaker 4>in some scientific basis for them.</v>

2490
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:14:33.031 --> 01:14:33.421
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2492
01:14:33.421 --> 01:14:33.891
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2493
01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:38.130
<v Speaker 1>what Edgar Mitchell's deal is with a sock with um,</v>

2494
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:38.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2495
01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:43.940
<v Speaker 1>aliens rather is that he has talked to quite a few people that were high</v>

2496
01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:46.764
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

2497
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2498
01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:48.450
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2499
01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:48.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2500
01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:52.980
<v Speaker 1>in the Joint Chiefs of staff intelligence committees type characters.</v>

2501
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And they told him there was a Ufo crash,</v>

2502
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.100
<v Speaker 1>that there was an alien space craft at Roswell and that um,</v>

2503
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:00.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2504
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.310
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fascinating stuff listening to him,</v>

2505
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:04.080
<v Speaker 1>a reading rather this thing.</v>

2506
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And he had something to do with the disclosure project with Dr. Steven Greer who</v>

2507
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.630
<v Speaker 1>one day we would like to get him on this podcast as well cause he's another very</v>

2508
01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.040
<v Speaker 1>highly credible person.</v>

2509
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2510
01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:14.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2511
01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:19.020
<v Speaker 1>his disclosure project included a lot of very high level of former military</v>

2512
01:15:19.021 --> 01:15:23.040
<v Speaker 1>people who talked about their experiences and they think that it's high time</v>

2513
01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:27.780
<v Speaker 1>that we start being honest about what these people in high levels of the</v>

2514
01:15:27.781 --> 01:15:29.540
<v Speaker 1>military have already experienced.</v>

2515
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.540
<v Speaker 1>You know about it.</v>

2516
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that there's,</v>

2517
01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a high level of probability that a,</v>

2518
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:42.660
<v Speaker 1>we are consistently visited by some freaky dudes from another part of the world</v>

2519
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:44.760
<v Speaker 1>or another dimension or,</v>

2520
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.780
<v Speaker 1>but they're just can slip in and out like that and we don't really know what the</v>

2521
01:15:48.781 --> 01:15:49.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going on.</v>

2522
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2523
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.613
<v Speaker 1>that whole,</v>

2524
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>the one of the arguments should get from this section</v>

2525
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 4>thanks is that our planet is,</v>

2526
01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:56.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2527
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 4>one among so many.</v>

2528
01:15:57.401 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 4>How would they find us?</v>

2529
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 4>What kind of propulsion system could possibly carry them here?</v>

2530
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.053
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2531
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>and they're basing this all off on what we know right now with our technology</v>

2532
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and our understanding at the moment.</v>

2533
01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:09.081
<v Speaker 1>But as you said,</v>

2534
01:16:09.081 --> 01:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>like if you've got a civilization that's been around for thousands or</v>

2535
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>potentially even a million or more years,</v>

2536
01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>who knows what they could have.</v>

2537
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.710
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2538
01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2539
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:22.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a silly sort of argument to me because it's based so much on this idea that</v>

2540
01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:26.390
<v Speaker 1>this is advanced is where ever going to get to the fact that 200 years ago when</v>

2541
01:16:26.391 --> 01:16:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you wanted a picture of something,</v>

2542
01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to draw it.</v>

2543
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.310
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get around you gotta to ride a fucking animal.</v>

2544
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It was the dumbest time ever.</v>

2545
01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You had to draw 200 years ago,</v>

2546
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you had a draw things to let anybody else know what they look like.</v>

2547
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>We're still doing that in the courtroom.</v>

2548
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:41.990
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2549
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.860
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2550
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But it's really incredible if you stop and look at that,</v>

2551
01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:50.720
<v Speaker 1>that we've gone from that in 200 years to making high res videos with your cell</v>

2552
01:16:50.721 --> 01:16:51.111
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

2553
01:16:51.111 --> 01:16:52.610
<v Speaker 1>watching streaming videos,</v>

2554
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:54.860
<v Speaker 1>playing video games on a tablet.</v>

2555
01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2556
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:56.540
<v Speaker 1>just that leap.</v>

2557
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.850
<v Speaker 1>No one saw coming before photographs.</v>

2558
01:16:58.851 --> 01:17:03.851
<v Speaker 1>No one would have imagined that this tiny blip in human time of 200 years could</v>

2559
01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:06.590
<v Speaker 1>have that much innovation.</v>

2560
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2561
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:06.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2562
01:17:06.971 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 4>the only time I really get sad about dying now is what I think</v>

2563
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 6>about the shit I'm going to miss.</v>

2564
01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2565
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 6>the advances that are coming up,</v>

2566
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 6>like I'd like to,</v>

2567
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to experience that slight privacy.</v>

2568
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 6>You're going to miss privacy.</v>

2569
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 6>That shit's out the window son.</v>

2570
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:21.051
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2571
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:21.531
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

2572
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:23.210
<v Speaker 6>that's the first thing that's going to go I think.</v>

2573
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 6>I think there really would be no privacy and about a hundred years,</v>

2574
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:27.261
<v Speaker 6>100 years.</v>

2575
01:17:27.261 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I think everyone's going to know it probably won't even,</v>

2576
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 6>that belong to would take that long strangely disinterested in privacy now too.</v>

2577
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:33.141
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2578
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 6>I can't get over how rob people are in terms of the information they share about</v>

2579
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 6>themselves on Facebook and you lose a phone,</v>

2580
01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 6>you lose your diary.</v>

2581
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:41.571
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2582
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 6>like you could get all your family photos or people's phone numbers,</v>

2583
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:45.830
<v Speaker 6>your past texts,</v>

2584
01:17:45.831 --> 01:17:46.700
<v Speaker 6>you or emails.</v>

2585
01:17:46.701 --> 01:17:47.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2586
01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:47.770
<v Speaker 6>that person's,</v>

2587
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:51.350
<v Speaker 6>that's gained a huge part of your privacy by just losing a phone.</v>

2588
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.071
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 6>If you don't have a fucking password on a stupid,</v>

2590
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 6>most people don't that that's true.</v>

2591
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.470
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2592
01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 6>if you're like a person who wants to like peer into someone's text messages,</v>

2593
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:01.611
<v Speaker 6>but I think,</v>

2594
01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:02.420
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2595
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 6>that that access ultimately will one day just be universal.</v>

2596
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:08.960
<v Speaker 6>Everybody will be able to find out anything that anybody's doing.</v>

2597
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 6>People are walking around with apps now that will automatically tweet where they</v>

2598
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

2599
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:12.831
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:18:12.831 --> 01:18:13.664
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

2601
01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.640
<v Speaker 6>Geotagging it's great if you want to stalk them though.</v>

2602
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.870
<v Speaker 6>It's really stalking somebody in the Geo tag and all over the fucking place.</v>

2603
01:18:19.871 --> 01:18:22.550
<v Speaker 6>You can narrow it down pretty good.</v>

2604
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.040
<v Speaker 6>People are weird man.</v>

2606
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:25.611
<v Speaker 6>It's the,</v>

2607
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:25.850
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2608
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 6>the whole connection hasn't been figured out yet.</v>

2609
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 6>This whole connection between every human being on the planet through the</v>

2610
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.350
<v Speaker 6>Internet really hasn't really been,</v>

2611
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:33.831
<v Speaker 6>I figured out,</v>

2612
01:18:33.831 --> 01:18:35.510
<v Speaker 6>I thought you were going mystical with that for a second.</v>

2613
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 6>This whole connection does that as well.</v>

2614
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 6>Trying to figure that out too.</v>

2615
01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:38.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2616
01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.280
<v Speaker 6>Well I think that as we said,</v>

2617
01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:44.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that the human body in this form is done.</v>

2618
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.901
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2619
01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 6>I think it's continuing to change and continuing to,</v>

2620
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people don't like to use the word evolve cause you know real evolution</v>

2621
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:56.210
<v Speaker 6>involves mutation and adaptation to your natural surroundings and it might not</v>

2622
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 6>just be that.</v>

2623
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.261
<v Speaker 6>It might be,</v>

2624
01:18:57.261 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 6>there might be a lot of things going on,</v>

2625
01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:02.500
<v Speaker 6>a constant move towards improvement or around losing senses.</v>

2626
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.630
<v Speaker 6>Are you familiar with you that the overview overview effect?</v>

2627
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:06.643
<v Speaker 6>You should play with that?</v>

2628
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:06.861
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2629
01:19:06.861 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>

2630
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 6>So that's what Edgar Mitchell experienced,</v>

2631
01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:09.500
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2632
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:09.891
<v Speaker 6>And he,</v>

2633
01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 6>he's very adamant about this and it seems to be true.</v>

2634
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.900
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2635
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 6>and NASA,</v>

2636
01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:14.594
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2637
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.501
<v Speaker 6>allows that,</v>

2638
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:19.790
<v Speaker 6>this happens now that that the people they send up into space,</v>

2639
01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:20.480
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2640
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.360
<v Speaker 6>are changed by the experience of seeing the earth from space.</v>

2641
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 6>It has a profound impact on them.</v>

2642
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.670
<v Speaker 6>They feel it.</v>

2643
01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 6>And for Mitchell it becomes a spiritual experience,</v>

2644
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2645
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:32.120
<v Speaker 6>for other people at it got the more involved in politics.</v>

2646
01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:37.070
<v Speaker 6>They recognize the how arbitrary the lines between countries are in the lines.</v>

2647
01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:38.210
<v Speaker 6>We draw a culturally,</v>

2648
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:38.810
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2649
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:39.201
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>

2650
01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:44.201
<v Speaker 6>they see just how fragile our little planet is hanging out there in space and it</v>

2651
01:19:46.611 --> 01:19:47.450
<v Speaker 6>changes them.</v>

2652
01:19:47.451 --> 01:19:49.880
<v Speaker 6>And I think most of us would agree it's changing them,</v>

2653
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.501
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2654
01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 6>for the better.</v>

2655
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:53.360
<v Speaker 6>They end up coming home and doing,</v>

2656
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.960
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2657
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.440
<v Speaker 6>sort of more altruistic things with their lives.</v>

2658
01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.740
<v Speaker 6>And now we're going to have civilians being set up into space.</v>

2659
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:03.620
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2660
01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:07.070
<v Speaker 6>mostly wealthy civilians initially because how much that rides going to cost</v>

2661
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:07.923
<v Speaker 6>right from</v>

2662
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:11.440
<v Speaker 4>Bigelow aerospace or virgin every time I have $100,000,</v>

2663
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.580
<v Speaker 4>$150,000.</v>

2664
01:20:12.581 --> 01:20:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I came up with the price at this point,</v>

2665
01:20:13.901 --> 01:20:18.550
<v Speaker 4>but I had researched it and we're going to have general civilians getting</v>

2666
01:20:18.551 --> 01:20:22.240
<v Speaker 4>shopping Sean up in his face and having an experience of seeing the earth from</v>

2667
01:20:22.241 --> 01:20:22.660
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2668
01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:27.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to begin to slowly change the culture,</v>

2669
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I would think.</v>

2670
01:20:28.151 --> 01:20:31.030
<v Speaker 4>Because if you look at how dramatically it changed the lives of all the people</v>

2671
01:20:31.031 --> 01:20:32.260
<v Speaker 4>who've gone into space,</v>

2672
01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 4>it's going to change these people too.</v>

2673
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:34.763
<v Speaker 4>To some degree.</v>

2674
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:38.110
<v Speaker 4>You're Mitchell's take on it is very trippy,</v>

2675
01:20:38.111 --> 01:20:38.944
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2676
01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.620
<v Speaker 2>It's very trippy when the,</v>

2677
01:20:41.621 --> 01:20:42.251
<v Speaker 2>when he was,</v>

2678
01:20:42.251 --> 01:20:42.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2679
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.121
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

2680
01:20:43.121 --> 01:20:43.451
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2681
01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:45.340
<v Speaker 2>the spacecraft coming home,</v>

2682
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.101
<v Speaker 2>this is his word.</v>

2683
01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly I realized that the molecules and my body were created in an ancient</v>

2684
01:20:49.661 --> 01:20:51.040
<v Speaker 2>generation of stars.</v>

2685
01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly that became personal and visceral,</v>

2686
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>not intellectual.</v>

2687
01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:57.340
<v Speaker 2>And I had never had this experience.</v>

2688
01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It was accompanied by bliss and ecstasy I had never experienced.</v>

2689
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:03.933
<v Speaker 2>So he's calling,</v>

2690
01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.200
<v Speaker 2>it's calling it Samadhi.</v>

2691
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.070
<v Speaker 4>I quote that in the classic actually,</v>

2692
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 4>cause it's a,</v>

2693
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 4>it's a heavy quote and um,</v>

2694
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:10.771
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2695
01:21:10.771 --> 01:21:14.910
<v Speaker 4>he felt literally it was like his flesh dropped away.</v>

2696
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 4>His bones went away.</v>

2697
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been to,</v>

2698
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2699
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 4>the Keck observatory?</v>

2700
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.100
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2701
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:20.933
<v Speaker 4>The Keck Observer,</v>

2702
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Tori and Hawaii on the big island.</v>

2703
01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2704
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.661
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2705
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:25.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2706
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:28.510
<v Speaker 2>one island and Hawaii that's so big.</v>

2707
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>You get so high and the big island that you go through the clouds,</v>

2708
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2709
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

2710
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2711
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2712
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:34.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2713
01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Well he loads just the city.</v>

2714
01:21:35.381 --> 01:21:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Then the Keck observatory is,</v>

2715
01:21:37.121 --> 01:21:37.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2716
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:38.111
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2717
01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:38.944
<v Speaker 2>I think it's on them.</v>

2718
01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the Mauna Loa volcano,</v>

2719
01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.060
<v Speaker 2>which whatever one it is the biggest one.</v>

2720
01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And it's that there's a,</v>

2721
01:21:45.411 --> 01:21:46.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2722
01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:50.590
<v Speaker 2>like a visitor station that's down at like 9,000 plus feet,</v>

2723
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:52.270
<v Speaker 2>and then you go even higher.</v>

2724
01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.111
<v Speaker 2>They have the,</v>

2725
01:21:53.111 --> 01:21:53.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2726
01:21:53.171 --> 01:21:54.010
<v Speaker 2>the telescopes there,</v>

2727
01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.690
<v Speaker 2>but you get out of the car and you're through the clouds and the way the big</v>

2728
01:21:58.691 --> 01:21:59.441
<v Speaker 2>island is set up,</v>

2729
01:21:59.441 --> 01:22:03.130
<v Speaker 2>they have these diffused lights so that they don't create light pollution</v>

2730
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>because of the observatory.</v>

2731
01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So the fucking milky way was so stunning.</v>

2732
01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It was so that to this day,</v>

2733
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>all I think about when we talk about going on vacation,</v>

2734
01:22:14.021 --> 01:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like we've got to get back to that Keck.</v>

2735
01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I got to see that again.</v>

2736
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I just got to look up and see that again because it really did feel like you</v>

2737
01:22:20.021 --> 01:22:24.460
<v Speaker 2>were flying through an impossibly filled galaxy.</v>

2738
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like usually you see like a few stars like here and there,</v>

2739
01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2740
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.880
<v Speaker 2>up there with that high,</v>

2741
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:32.570
<v Speaker 2>high altitude and the,</v>

2742
01:22:32.571 --> 01:22:35.620
<v Speaker 2>the really zero light pollution and clear skies.</v>

2743
01:22:35.621 --> 01:22:36.490
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

2744
01:22:36.491 --> 01:22:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I studied</v>

2745
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.990
<v Speaker 4>dreaming in Hilo and the Big island.</v>

2746
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.240
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I would do is,</v>

2747
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.491
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2748
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:42.680
<v Speaker 4>at night before I go to bed,</v>

2749
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.630
<v Speaker 4>I would lay out in the grass and just stare straight up because I'm in Philly.</v>

2750
01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:47.931
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2751
01:22:47.931 --> 01:22:48.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2752
01:22:48.141 --> 01:22:51.230
<v Speaker 4>You just don't get stars like that in Philadelphia because there were,</v>

2753
01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.940
<v Speaker 4>there were really no lights.</v>

2754
01:22:52.941 --> 01:22:55.040
<v Speaker 4>We were at this little retreat type center and,</v>

2755
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:55.933
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2756
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:56.953
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2757
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.930
<v Speaker 4>it set the scene real well to go upstairs and try and have a lucid dream.</v>

2758
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:00.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:23:00.681 --> 01:23:03.410
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine it would set the scene for freaking yourself out.</v>

2760
01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 2>So never gotten over that image.</v>

2761
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:07.031
<v Speaker 2>Just see.</v>

2762
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:07.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2763
01:23:07.301 --> 01:23:10.120
<v Speaker 2>there was only a couple hours of just staring at the sky,</v>

2764
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:12.460
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't believe how beautiful it looked.</v>

2765
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I got to imagine it's probably a hundred times more beautiful when you're in</v>

2766
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>space orbiting the earth.</v>

2767
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:18.791
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2768
01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen those photos that they take when they're up there,</v>

2769
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2770
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2771
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>like you're orbiting the fucking plant.</v>

2772
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:25.804
<v Speaker 2>You're above it.</v>

2773
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Looking down at just the circular nature of it all and like,</v>

2774
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2775
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 2>something to consider there too.</v>

2776
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:31.971
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>

2777
01:23:31.971 --> 01:23:32.804
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

2778
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>fascinating about the overview effect.</v>

2779
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>You can show people these pictures and they don't have the reaction that you</v>

2780
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:40.300
<v Speaker 2>have from from being there.</v>

2781
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2782
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:40.961
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2783
01:23:40.961 --> 01:23:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Images never capture the,</v>

2786
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the real emotion of the moment.</v>

2787
01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:46.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2788
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:49.420
<v Speaker 2>the connection of the moment when you're actually in space.</v>

2789
01:23:49.421 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be a real mind fuck.</v>

2790
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:52.683
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

2791
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.200
<v Speaker 2>the connection of camping as opposed to actual camping,</v>

2792
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:56.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2793
01:23:56.681 --> 01:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>multiple wild fuck.</v>

2794
01:23:57.961 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Are you going camping?</v>

2795
01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:00.820
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to sleep in the woods?</v>

2796
01:24:00.821 --> 01:24:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Stupid in the,</v>

2797
01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:02.710
<v Speaker 2>don't you have a house?</v>

2798
01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 2>But once you do it and he'd go,</v>

2799
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.531
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2800
01:24:05.531 --> 01:24:06.161
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2801
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:07.060
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

2802
01:24:07.061 --> 01:24:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you're out here in nature.</v>

2803
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I use a totally different feeling.</v>

2804
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2805
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.510
<v Speaker 2>my wife is going to be really glad that you're saying this because she wants me</v>

2806
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 2>desperately to go tent camping with her.</v>

2807
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:15.431
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2808
01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:15.710
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2809
01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:17.050
<v Speaker 2>my feeling always,</v>

2810
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:17.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2811
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 2>let's just get a cabin,</v>

2812
01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:18.541
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>

2813
01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll walk out in the woods at night.</v>

2814
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.910
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2815
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:22.000
<v Speaker 2>You want to go deer hunting.</v>

2816
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Then you can camp out and make,</v>

2817
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.903
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

2818
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:26.940
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

2819
01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:27.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2820
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:28.181
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

2821
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2822
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.950
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a agreement.</v>

2823
01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:31.780
<v Speaker 2>We're back to the new year all at one shot.</v>

2824
01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Deniros ridiculous.</v>

2826
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 2>You've got to shoot him twice.</v>

2827
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they go down,</v>

2828
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:37.191
<v Speaker 2>got to execute them.</v>

2829
01:24:37.191 --> 01:24:38.024
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

2830
01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2831
01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2832
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:40.381
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2833
01:24:40.381 --> 01:24:40.531
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2834
01:24:40.531 --> 01:24:44.620
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's weird about camping is that when you're away from like</v>

2835
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 2>electricity and House and all that shit for a long enough,</v>

2836
01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you kind of like get this like real humble feeling like,</v>

2837
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:53.201
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2838
01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:53.561
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2839
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:54.394
<v Speaker 2>I get this.</v>

2840
01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Like we're just like another animal who just figured out some way to separate</v>

2841
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 2>ourself so we can do our work and we separate ourselves.</v>

2842
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 2>At our houses and in there we create these computers and electrically hooked</v>

2843
01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:10.120
<v Speaker 2>things together and all along as we separate ourselves from the nature,</v>

2844
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>because we're out there in the nature,</v>

2845
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 2>you might get eaten and you got to go find some food.</v>

2846
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:15.021
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2847
01:25:15.021 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 2>shit can go wrong.</v>

2848
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2849
01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he put that pure l and your hands bitch and go back to work.</v>

2850
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.800
<v Speaker 2>So you get your house and you're,</v>

2851
01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2852
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:23.770
<v Speaker 2>you hide from the connection with the outside world,</v>

2853
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:25.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you camping and it's an escapable,</v>

2854
01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird feeling when you're out there for,</v>

2855
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I did a recently five days with no cell phones,</v>

2856
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 2>no electricity,</v>

2857
01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:33.034
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2858
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 2>no heat,</v>

2859
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.653
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

2860
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.780
<v Speaker 2>And we had to start a fire.</v>

2861
01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:36.581
<v Speaker 2>If you want to stay warm,</v>

2862
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and it was in Montana,</v>

2863
01:25:37.421 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 2>it was freezing cold.</v>

2864
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.890
<v Speaker 2>But doing that you,</v>

2865
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you really have a different sort of feeling and appreciation for what nature</v>

2866
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>actually is.</v>

2867
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.753
<v Speaker 2>Nature's,</v>

2868
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:52.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're disconnected from one of the fucking coolest things ever for a</v>

2869
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 2>human to experience.</v>

2870
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 2>We're completely disconnected from it.</v>

2871
01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people who lived their whole lives in cities and in suburbs and</v>

2872
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>they drive back and forth from work and they never out there in the woods.</v>

2873
01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget a guy and a college if who went on this big long tirade and I</v>

2874
01:26:10.211 --> 01:26:12.740
<v Speaker 4>thought he might be mentally unbalanced because one of this big one fucking</v>

2875
01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.520
<v Speaker 4>tirade that how like I'm still so,</v>

2876
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:16.210
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't philosophy class actually too.</v>

2877
01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.193
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sick.</v>

2878
01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.900
<v Speaker 4>People talking about the outdoors and how the outdoors just so great outdoors</v>

2879
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:21.520
<v Speaker 4>suck.</v>

2880
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.720
<v Speaker 4>You get bit by bugs.</v>

2881
01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:23.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

2882
01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:24.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't what the fuck's going on?</v>

2883
01:26:24.461 --> 01:26:25.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what's gonna Happen Next?</v>

2884
01:26:25.331 --> 01:26:27.070
<v Speaker 4>You get rained on your wet.</v>

2885
01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:28.210
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck's great about that?</v>

2886
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:30.820
<v Speaker 4>That was his take on the entire outdoors.</v>

2887
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Well that spent his entire life like in a,</v>

2888
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:33.160
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2889
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.791
<v Speaker 4>in a mall.</v>

2890
01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:34.150
<v Speaker 4>I guess</v>

2891
01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:35.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the classic cynics approach,</v>

2892
01:26:35.921 --> 01:26:36.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2893
01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it the classic cynics approach you like for the hipster?</v>

2894
01:26:39.701 --> 01:26:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Like if fucking everything sucks,</v>

2895
01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:42.034
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2896
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.240
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck that's,</v>

2897
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.020
<v Speaker 2>that is our are spoiled societies creation.</v>

2898
01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:47.963
<v Speaker 4>I have to tell you,</v>

2899
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.130
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the biggest pushbacks I've gotten on the firm from that sort of</v>

2900
01:26:53.131 --> 01:26:54.090
<v Speaker 4>crowd on the book.</v>

2901
01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Then like the whole idea that I was going to go study lucid dreaming and learn</v>

2902
01:26:57.571 --> 01:26:59.520
<v Speaker 4>to meditate and and do all these things,</v>

2903
01:26:59.521 --> 01:27:00.354
<v Speaker 4>you know like why?</v>

2904
01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:01.501
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2905
01:27:01.501 --> 01:27:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Like why would you put that kind of effort?</v>

2906
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.230
<v Speaker 4>It was sort of just sort of like,</v>

2907
01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:06.151
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2908
01:27:06.151 --> 01:27:08.850
<v Speaker 4>I guess they feel so great in their skinny jeans that the idea of doing</v>

2909
01:27:08.851 --> 01:27:11.340
<v Speaker 4>something to improve themselves further or you know what I mean?</v>

2910
01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:13.140
<v Speaker 4>Just seems like an admission of defeat.</v>

2911
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.581
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2912
01:27:13.581 --> 01:27:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's supposed to be so cool right there.</v>

2913
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2914
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:16.421
<v Speaker 2>Well that is,</v>

2915
01:27:16.421 --> 01:27:17.201
<v Speaker 2>that is the thing.</v>

2916
01:27:17.201 --> 01:27:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Like why bother?</v>

2917
01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:20.260
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing out there with your head?</v>

2918
01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.731
<v Speaker 2>Would you stupid,</v>

2919
01:27:21.731 --> 01:27:22.990
<v Speaker 2>psychic bullshit.</v>

2920
01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:23.981
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

2921
01:27:23.981 --> 01:27:24.701
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

2922
01:27:24.701 --> 01:27:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2923
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.133
<v Speaker 2>Look at my genes.</v>

2924
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.840
<v Speaker 2>What if they have skinny jeans and they're sag and have you seen that?</v>

2925
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:30.190
<v Speaker 2>That makes you fucking violent,</v>

2926
01:27:30.191 --> 01:27:30.630
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2927
01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2928
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:32.620
<v Speaker 2>it makes me want to throttle those little,</v>

2929
01:27:32.621 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2930

01:27:34.961 --> 01:27:35.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem.</v>

2934
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.410
<v Speaker 2>They put the CIGGIES,</v>

2935
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.170
<v Speaker 2>they put them down low on purpose.</v>

2936
01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a move to have your skinny jeans kind of saggy male Cleve hello.</v>

2937
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:43.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2938
01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:44.260
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

2939
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just let them know silly fucks.</v>

2940
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:49.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2941
01:27:49.091 --> 01:27:50.200
<v Speaker 2>That detachment thing,</v>

2942
01:27:50.201 --> 01:27:51.280
<v Speaker 2>it's really disturbing.</v>

2943
01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:52.600
<v Speaker 2>It's such a weak,</v>

2944
01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:56.140
<v Speaker 2>fake sort of a complacency.</v>

2945
01:27:56.410 --> 01:27:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2946
01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.000
<v Speaker 2>they're just terrified.</v>

2947
01:27:58.030 --> 01:28:00.340
<v Speaker 2>So they're just pretending to don't give a fuck about anything.</v>

2948
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about anything.</v>

2949
01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:03.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2950
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:03.621
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot.</v>

2951
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:06.380
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of that terrified I think is the operative word.</v>

2952
01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:06.921
<v Speaker 4>I think it ain't,</v>

2953
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:07.310
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2954
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.671
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

2955
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:08.280
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

2956
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 4>I am not to be able to quote exactly what is Martin Sheen who,</v>

2957
01:28:11.241 --> 01:28:11.690
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2958
01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:12.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2959
01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.640
<v Speaker 4>in that guy went through the shit.</v>

2960
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:14.061
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2961
01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2962
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.700
<v Speaker 4>at the whole apocalypse now filming in that whole story,</v>

2963
01:28:16.701 --> 01:28:18.050
<v Speaker 4>the whole RQ went through.</v>

2964
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2965
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:23.060
<v Speaker 4>the basic fact we need to understand about life is that it's terrifying.</v>

2966
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2967
01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2968
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:25.034
<v Speaker 4>we are,</v>

2969
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 4>we are cauldrons of anxiety.</v>

2970
01:28:27.621 --> 01:28:28.580
<v Speaker 4>We have a part of our brain,</v>

2971
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:31.640
<v Speaker 4>the Bigelow that whenever we're confronted by ambiguous information is</v>

2972
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:32.570
<v Speaker 4>immediately going to be like,</v>

2973
01:28:32.571 --> 01:28:33.404
<v Speaker 4>check for danger.</v>

2974
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:34.243
<v Speaker 4>Check for danger.</v>

2975
01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2976
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.271
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

2977
01:28:35.271 --> 01:28:37.100
<v Speaker 4>it sort of prohibits us from,</v>

2978
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:37.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2979
01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:38.181
<v Speaker 4>learning,</v>

2980
01:28:38.181 --> 01:28:38.721
<v Speaker 4>growing,</v>

2981
01:28:38.721 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 4>trying to find out a new things.</v>

2982
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 4>If we give into that,</v>

2983
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are,</v>

2984
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:47.000
<v Speaker 2>we're animals and we have instincts to stay alive and those instincts are going</v>

2985
01:28:47.001 --> 01:28:49.000
<v Speaker 2>to get fired up left and right all around,</v>

2986
01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.060
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're in a city and is constantly surrounded by people packed</v>

2987
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:53.894
<v Speaker 2>into a place.</v>

2988
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think your senses,</v>

2989
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2990
01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the adapt your feelings and intuition sort of adapt to that environment.</v>

2991
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2992
01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it really made sense when you</v>

2993
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.420
<v Speaker 1>were talking about people or hunters and people who were inner city people.</v>

2994
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're in involved in a real,</v>

2995
01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

2996
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>in an inner city situation that's very primal</v>

2997
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 4>and you have to learn to slow it down.</v>

2998
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.740
<v Speaker 4>You have to learn that because there's so much happening around you in a way.</v>

2999
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 4>You kind of have to learn to slow it down to,</v>

3000
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 4>to see what,</v>

3001
01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 4>what's important here,</v>

3002
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.740
<v Speaker 4>what do I really need that my eye on?</v>

3003
01:29:22.741 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Because there's so many different things that could distract you potentially</v>

3004
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:26.850
<v Speaker 4>fuck you up.</v>

3005
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3006
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.210
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3007
01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:28.750
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3008
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:33.750
<v Speaker 1>what other information or what other pieces of evidence about aliens have ever</v>

3009
01:29:34.781 --> 01:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>led you to believe conclusively one way or another that,</v>

3010
01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that there is something else.</v>

3011
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:40.321
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3012
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3013
01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 4>that's another one where I conclusively believe that Ufo is or unidentified</v>

3014
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:46.261
<v Speaker 4>flying objects.</v>

3015
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3016
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3017
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.450
<v Speaker 4>And there are times when we just need to kind of,</v>

3018
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 4>they're people who want to honor sort of like materials science and their people</v>

3019
01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 4>want to honor some sort of dogmatic religion.</v>

3020
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I want to honor that like gap in our knowledge to some degree.</v>

3021
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:56.131
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3022
01:29:56.131 --> 01:29:56.261
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3023
01:29:56.261 --> 01:29:59.170
<v Speaker 4>and just acknowledge that it's there and,</v>

3024
01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's what we're working through.</v>

3025
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.771
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3026
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:01.871
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3027
01:30:01.871 --> 01:30:03.120
<v Speaker 4>we need more information,</v>

3028
01:30:03.121 --> 01:30:03.954
<v Speaker 4>more data,</v>

3029
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.580
<v Speaker 4>not less.</v>

3030
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.533
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3031
01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:06.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3032
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.670
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3033
01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 4>so the UFO question,</v>

3034
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:09.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3035
01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 4>have we been visited?</v>

3036
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not entirely sure.</v>

3037
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:12.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3038
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:13.740
<v Speaker 4>even at Stevenville signing,</v>

3039
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get a chance to get into this,</v>

3040
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:15.291
<v Speaker 4>but that Steven,</v>

3041
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.124
<v Speaker 4>it'll siding.</v>

3042
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a military base nearby.</v>

3043
01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:22.320
<v Speaker 4>This guy claimed that he was harassed for a weeks afterward by a member of the</v>

3044
01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:22.770
<v Speaker 4>military.</v>

3045
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:26.730
<v Speaker 4>There's this story in the book about somebody showing up on his property and in</v>

3046
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:31.731
<v Speaker 4>the middle of the night making his dog's bark and just staring into his door and</v>

3047
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:34.050
<v Speaker 4>clearly wearing chemo gear.</v>

3048
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 4>And this was during the same period when he was getting these threatening phone</v>

3049
01:30:37.981 --> 01:30:38.730
<v Speaker 4>calls from,</v>

3050
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:41.460
<v Speaker 4>from a guy who was identifying himself as a member of the military.</v>

3051
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:44.160
<v Speaker 4>So is it possible that,</v>

3052
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:45.083
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3053
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:46.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3054
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.360
<v Speaker 4>people are encountering at times,</v>

3055
01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:51.060
<v Speaker 4>some sort of advanced military technology?</v>

3056
01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:52.290
<v Speaker 4>It's to me,</v>

3057
01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:55.680
<v Speaker 4>no coincidence that people started reporting triangle shaped Ufo shortly before</v>

3058
01:30:55.681 --> 01:30:57.210
<v Speaker 4>the stealth bomber was right,</v>

3059
01:30:57.211 --> 01:30:58.470
<v Speaker 4>ultimately revealed.</v>

3060
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3061
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.560
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes that's the explanation.</v>

3062
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3063
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:03.450
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3064
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.350
<v Speaker 4>for me it simply the vastness of the universe,</v>

3065
01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 4>it's age.</v>

3066
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:09.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3067
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we,</v>

3068
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.450
<v Speaker 4>we would,</v>

3069
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 4>the chances that we're the only,</v>

3070
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.903
<v Speaker 4>only,</v>

3071
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:15.983
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3072
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:22.470
<v Speaker 4>planet that's evolved life like this seem so small that surely somebody out</v>

3073
01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 4>there has developed a kind of technology would take to find us and get here.</v>

3074
01:31:26.641 --> 01:31:26.821
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3075
01:31:26.821 --> 01:31:27.240
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3076
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 4>that's the kind of thinking that that really opens me up.</v>

3077
01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:30.930
<v Speaker 4>You don't mean to,</v>

3078
01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:31.670
<v Speaker 4>to the possibility</v>

3079
01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:32.960
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are just too crazy.</v>

3080
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:38.500
<v Speaker 1>100 billion stars with who knows how many planets more than you know,</v>

3081
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:41.780
<v Speaker 1>more than one per per star.</v>

3082
01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3083
01:31:42.111 --> 01:31:43.490
<v Speaker 1>some of our binary systems,</v>

3084
01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:44.373
<v Speaker 1>we don't know</v>

3085
01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.560
<v Speaker 4>that's just this galaxy but commune.</v>

3086
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:47.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a joke.</v>

3087
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3088
01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.930
<v Speaker 4>and there are enough of these cases where you know like Greer's people,</v>

3089
01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:54.260
<v Speaker 4>the military people would come forward and say that something happened or</v>

3090
01:31:54.261 --> 01:31:54.441
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3091
01:31:54.441 --> 01:31:54.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3092
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 4>And enough of these people are are credible and in and left and then on</v>

3093
01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 4>identified</v>

3094
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.930
<v Speaker 6>category that you start to think,</v>

3095
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3096
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3097
01:32:02.621 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 6>maybe it</v>

3098
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 2>some point.</v>

3099
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Some of these,</v>

3100
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>so many people are full of shit and so many people have told lies that if you</v>

3101
01:32:08.771 --> 01:32:13.771
<v Speaker 2>have any thoughts in your head that you're going to be able to tell people that</v>

3102
01:32:14.081 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you believe in Ufos and not have them ridicule you.</v>

3103
01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:18.580
<v Speaker 2>That was good fucking luck.</v>

3104
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Good luck like being a serious person and being taken seriously.</v>

3105
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 2>If we had Obama,</v>

3106
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:28.890
<v Speaker 2>if Obama was on TV and he started talking about Ufos and his experience and what</v>

3107
01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:32.080
<v Speaker 2>he believes they are and that he believes that we're being visited by</v>

3108
01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:34.380
<v Speaker 2>intelligent beings from some other dimension,</v>

3109
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 6>he immediately is going to get,</v>

3110
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 6>people will haul him off to crazy town.</v>

3111
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:39.910
<v Speaker 6>Look what happened to Dennis Kucinich.</v>

3112
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:40.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3113
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 6>When he told that story,</v>

3114
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3115
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

3116
01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:45.280
<v Speaker 6>sort of was dragged through that story during the debate.</v>

3117
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 6>What was his story again?</v>

3118
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 6>Was it,</v>

3119
01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:48.850
<v Speaker 6>what year did he run?</v>

3120
01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 6>He ran in a recently 2004.</v>

3121
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:52.280
<v Speaker 6>Did he?</v>

3122
01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.113
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3123
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.011
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3124
01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:54.700
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3125
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:55.720
<v Speaker 6>he had written,</v>

3126
01:32:55.721 --> 01:32:56.261
<v Speaker 6>or I'm sorry,</v>

3127
01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 6>Shirley McClain,</v>

3128
01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:59.620
<v Speaker 6>who I guess is like a great aunt or something to him.</v>

3129
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:00.411
<v Speaker 6>God mother.</v>

3130
01:33:00.411 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 6>It came from the relationship.</v>

3131
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 6>She had written a red flag.</v>

3132
01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:03.963
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3133
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 6>she'd been in the family.</v>

3134
01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:11.090
<v Speaker 6>She rent a book in which he claimed that he had seen a Ufo and Tim Russert asked</v>

3135
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:14.680
<v Speaker 6>him about it during a debate.</v>

3136
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 6>And people immediately,</v>

3137
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.340
<v Speaker 6>and this is again,</v>

3138
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 6>the language was Ufo,</v>

3139
01:33:19.301 --> 01:33:20.280
<v Speaker 6>not alien craft,</v>

3140
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:21.123
<v Speaker 6>but Ufo.</v>

3141
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 6>The people immediately burst into laughter and you can hear it,</v>

3142
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:24.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3143
01:33:24.701 --> 01:33:25.121
<v Speaker 6>on the video.</v>

3144
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 6>I write about this in the book too.</v>

3145
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:27.450
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3146
01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:29.770
<v Speaker 6>when people immediately start laughing and he starts saying,</v>

3147
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 6>well look,</v>

3148
01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:30.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3149
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:30.851
<v Speaker 6>Ufo,</v>

3150
01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:33.340
<v Speaker 6>it's unidentified and people are still sort of,</v>

3151
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:37.120
<v Speaker 6>now you hear people kind of gasping because instead of rejecting it out of hand,</v>

3152
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:38.030
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

3153
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.331
<v Speaker 6>he's sort,</v>

3154
01:33:38.331 --> 01:33:40.120
<v Speaker 6>sorta trying to stick up for this.</v>

3155
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 6>Those are the [inaudible]</v>

3156
01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:45.250
<v Speaker 2>press people that you root for to get killed by the aliens that were in that</v>

3157
01:33:45.251 --> 01:33:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Mars attacks movie.</v>

3158
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.580
<v Speaker 2>They'd come down with the Reagans.</v>

3159
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3160
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:48.440
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

3161
01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:48.800
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

3162
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.600
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

3163
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.270
<v Speaker 6>Just start blasting them and killing them.</v>

3164
01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:53.680
<v Speaker 6>How and dignified to be killed by cartoonish aliens.</v>

3165
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:54.641
<v Speaker 6>The perfect end.</v>

3166
01:33:54.641 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 6>So way to go and I'm a perfect 10.</v>

3167
01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.101
<v Speaker 2>That movie.</v>

3168
01:33:57.101 --> 01:33:58.530
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking awesome.</v>

3169
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:59.011
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

3170
01:33:59.011 --> 01:34:01.350
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my favorite all time alien movies,</v>

3171
01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Mars attacks.</v>

3172
01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a much more likely how it's going to go down to this people that these</v>

3173
01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:08.010
<v Speaker 2>knuckleheads and think that the aliens are going to come save us.</v>

3174
01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:09.540
<v Speaker 2>We're not saving chimps.</v>

3175
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:09.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3176
01:34:09.871 --> 01:34:13.170
<v Speaker 2>we're not going into the fucking the Congo and given them laptops,</v>

3177
01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:13.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3178
01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:13.771
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

3179
01:34:13.771 --> 01:34:13.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3180
01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

3181
01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to say us.</v>

3182
01:34:16.530 --> 01:34:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Why would they save us the fuck out of here?</v>

3183
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.943
<v Speaker 2>And Mitchell,</v>

3184
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:21.840
<v Speaker 2>he knows,</v>

3185
01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.680
<v Speaker 2>he knows something.</v>

3186
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.500
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to tell us this guy.</v>

3187
01:34:25.501 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3188
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.610
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3189
01:34:26.610 --> 01:34:27.443

3191
01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Did he,</v>

3192
01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:30.960
<v Speaker 2>did he ever swirls?</v>

3193
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3194
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Did he like try to,</v>

3195
01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:33.121
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3196
01:34:33.121 --> 01:34:33.780
<v Speaker 6>you know what's funny,</v>

3197
01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:34.021
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3198
01:34:34.021 --> 01:34:38.070
<v Speaker 6>he tried to take pictures later of other,</v>

3199
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:39.383
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3200
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.080
<v Speaker 6>another siding.</v>

3201
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.790
<v Speaker 6>He said he had using a cell phone camera and he had another siding.</v>

3202
01:34:44.130 --> 01:34:44.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3203
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.293
<v Speaker 6>And this is Joan.</v>

3204
01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:46.201
<v Speaker 6>Same town,</v>

3205
01:34:46.201 --> 01:34:47.034
<v Speaker 6>but at night.</v>

3206
01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.210
<v Speaker 6>And this is 2008 and it's a Sheaf of can picture what it Lou Clark.</v>

3207
01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.990
<v Speaker 6>And actually it's a little bit of video actually too.</v>

3208
01:34:54.991 --> 01:34:56.160
<v Speaker 6>I think you captured video.</v>

3209
01:34:56.730 --> 01:34:57.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3210
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.910
<v Speaker 6>he stopped showing it because,</v>

3211
01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:00.083
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3212
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.590
<v Speaker 6>he realized it was embarrassingly bad comments.</v>

3213
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:04.550
<v Speaker 6>Rude.</v>

3214
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.791
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3215
01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:05.331
<v Speaker 6>here's the,</v>

3216
01:35:05.331 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 6>here's the issue.</v>

3217
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Like how good a picture is a cell phone camera gonna take of a light in the sky.</v>

3218
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:11.950
<v Speaker 6>Very fucking.</v>

3219
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:14.600
<v Speaker 6>Let me think about how good of a picture as a take of a moon,</v>

3220
01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:14.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3221
01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:16.340
<v Speaker 6>looks like a tiny little dot.</v>

3222
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.960
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible to see what an iPhone.</v>

3223
01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:20.720
<v Speaker 6>So that's another one of this sort of like a misleading,</v>

3224
01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:20.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3225
01:35:20.871 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 6>the red herrings thrown out there by the skeptics,</v>

3226
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 6>but we're all walking around with camera phones now.</v>

3227
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:24.471
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3228
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:24.711
<v Speaker 6>it has.</v>

3229
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 6>Camera phones suck for the most part.</v>

3230
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:29.960
<v Speaker 6>They'd have a very hard time taking a picture of a light in a dark field,</v>

3231
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3232
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.123
<v Speaker 6>Like dude,</v>

3233
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.233
<v Speaker 6>shucks guy,</v>

3234
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.193
<v Speaker 6>big foot.</v>

3235
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 6>I did not know big foot research.</v>

3236
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 6>I decided I was not going there.</v>

3237
01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.140
<v Speaker 6>Maybe in book two,</v>

3238
01:35:39.141 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 6>after you take mushrooms,</v>

3239
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:41.670
<v Speaker 6>then you commune with bigfoot.</v>

3240
01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3241
01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:42.500
<v Speaker 6>Big,</v>

3242
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 6>big foot to me was not on the radar.</v>

3243
01:35:43.731 --> 01:35:44.564
<v Speaker 6>Quiche is the thing.</v>

3244
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:48.000
<v Speaker 6>I was drawn to the idea that we're,</v>

3245
01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 6>the whole title of phrenology came from this.</v>

3246
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 6>These are subjects we pushed to the fringe.</v>

3247
01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.770
<v Speaker 6>But if you look at like near death experiences,</v>

3248
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 6>ghosts,</v>

3249
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:57.400
<v Speaker 6>Ufos,</v>

3250
01:35:57.810 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3251
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.920
<v Speaker 6>they speak to the big existential questions,</v>

3252
01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:01.250
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3253
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.640
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

3254
01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 6>that really plague us.</v>

3255
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:04.310
<v Speaker 6>The ones we don't have answers to.</v>

3256
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Speaker 6>What happens when we die?</v>

3257
01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 6>Are we alone in the universe?</v>

3258
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:08.811
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3259
01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:09.001
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

3260
01:36:09.001 --> 01:36:10.070
<v Speaker 6>what's it mean to be human?</v>

3261
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 6>These sorts of questions.</v>

3262
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:12.830
<v Speaker 6>Big Foot doesn't really,</v>

3263
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 6>doesn't really get into that,</v>

3264
01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.320
<v Speaker 6>into that field.</v>

3265
01:36:15.321 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 6>He's not in it,</v>

3266
01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3267
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:16.381
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

3268
01:36:16.381 --> 01:36:18.890
<v Speaker 6>he's not something that's gonna make me question.</v>

3269
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3270
01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:20.100
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3271
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:20.331
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3272
01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:22.760
<v Speaker 6>the idea that there might be some undiscovered ape,</v>

3273
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 6>it does not affect what happens when I die or whether or not we're alone in the</v>

3274
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:26.980
<v Speaker 6>universe.</v>

3275
01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:27.813
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3276
01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.510
<v Speaker 6>He got here on a fucking space ship.</v>

3277
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.353
<v Speaker 6>So you say this,</v>

3278
01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 6>but my friend called me up the other day.</v>

3279
01:36:32.331 --> 01:36:33.051
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God,</v>

3280
01:36:33.051 --> 01:36:35.360
<v Speaker 6>someone actually had a conversation with me and both as to it.</v>

3281
01:36:35.361 --> 01:36:35.990
<v Speaker 6>They're on the phone.</v>

3282
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.823
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3283
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 6>do you think that big food could be like an interdimensional being?</v>

3284
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:42.141
<v Speaker 6>It comes up.</v>

3285
01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 6>People do throw that out there,</v>

3286
01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:44.264
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't,</v>

3287
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 6>I decided to stay away and I said,</v>

3288
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:46.881
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3289
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that.</v>

3290
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that at all.</v>

3291
01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:50.570
<v Speaker 6>Even after you said it,</v>

3292
01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 6>I refuse to think it.</v>

3293
01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:52.151
<v Speaker 6>You Fuck?</v>

3294
01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 6>Who was that?</v>

3295
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm not telling you it was,</v>

3296
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:54.623
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't me.</v>

3297
01:36:55.210 --> 01:36:55.650
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't,</v>

3298
01:36:55.650 --> 01:36:55.910
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3299
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 6>it was not Brian Redman.</v>

3300
01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 6>Brian Redman could give a fuck about big foot or Ufos.</v>

3301
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:02.060
<v Speaker 6>He is a silly boy,</v>

3302
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 6>but he's not a silly boy.</v>

3303
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:06.230
<v Speaker 6>And when it comes to like ghosts and shit like that,</v>

3304
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:11.140
<v Speaker 3>mom and my sister and my Stepdad all say that their house is haunted.</v>

3305
01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3306
01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I've stayed at that house.</v>

3307
01:37:12.521 --> 01:37:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I've screamed,</v>

3308
01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 3>like go started jerks and I,</v>

3309
01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.600
<v Speaker 3>that was the edited version.</v>

3310
01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:17.381
<v Speaker 3>But I like,</v>

3311
01:37:17.381 --> 01:37:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I tried everything to like see or hear this goes that they all swear fine.</v>

3312
01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:21.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3313
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:25.520
<v Speaker 6>Maybe their haunted and their minds and their fucking dreams are haunted.</v>

3314
01:37:25.521 --> 01:37:26.000
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3315
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.020
<v Speaker 6>The life is haunted.</v>

3316
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.770
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that,</v>

3317
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:29.240
<v Speaker 6>maybe their life sucks a fat one.</v>

3318
01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 6>So they manufacturer ghosts scare the shit out of them in the middle of the</v>

3319
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.091
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>

3320
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3321
01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:34.010
<v Speaker 6>they gave me all the time too.</v>

3322
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:35.960
<v Speaker 6>I went out with a ghost for about,</v>

3323
01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:36.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3324
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:37.123
<v Speaker 6>not dated,</v>

3325
01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.270
<v Speaker 6>but along with them for about nine months or a year.</v>

3326
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:43.150
<v Speaker 6>That seems like a long test.</v>

3327
01:37:43.151 --> 01:37:44.120
<v Speaker 6>Part of the research for the book,</v>

3328
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:45.470
<v Speaker 6>nine months for a year.</v>

3329
01:37:45.471 --> 01:37:46.460
<v Speaker 6>How often did you do it?</v>

3330
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:47.510
<v Speaker 6>Gosh,</v>

3331
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 6>once,</v>

3332
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:49.650
<v Speaker 6>once a month probably.</v>

3333
01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 6>We went out and then when he had like a quote hot case,</v>

3334
01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:53.653
<v Speaker 6>I would go,</v>

3335
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 6>there was one case I went out on three,</v>

3336
01:37:56.521 --> 01:38:00.020
<v Speaker 6>four nights in a couple of week timespan um,</v>

3337
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:00.990
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>

3338
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:04.500
<v Speaker 6>there were times when the people didn't want to think anything was going on in</v>

3339
01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:06.160
<v Speaker 6>their house and uh,</v>

3340
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 6>brought him in and hopefully to debunk it.</v>

3341
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 6>But there were a lot of times that people brought him in hoping that they had it</v>

3342
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:12.990
<v Speaker 6>goes to excited about it,</v>

3343
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.510
<v Speaker 6>showing pictures of dust motes in the air and saying,</v>

3344
01:38:15.511 --> 01:38:16.560
<v Speaker 6>look at these orbs.</v>

3345
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 6>What are the words kind of thing.</v>

3346
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:20.720
<v Speaker 6>Please explain to me what the orbs are usually their dust modes,</v>

3347
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3348
01:38:21.170 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

3349
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 6>there's just dust and stuff floating in the,</v>

3350
01:38:23.311 --> 01:38:23.761
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3351
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 6>in the air near the camera lens.</v>

3352
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 6>And so the light flashes off of that.</v>

3353
01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3354
01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.920
<v Speaker 6>Dustin creates this round image that's semi transparent and</v>

3355
01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:38.210
<v Speaker 1>talk to Eddie Bravo because Eddie Bravo believes you manifest them with positive</v>

3356
01:38:38.211 --> 01:38:38.600
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

3357
01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3362
01:38:41.121 --> 01:38:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like got them gathered in his hands.</v>

3363
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's going on there.</v>

3364
01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Here's a test.</v>

3365
01:38:45.011 --> 01:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3366
01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3367
01:38:45.230 --> 01:38:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Bravo getting,</v>

3368
01:38:46.461 --> 01:38:48.800
<v Speaker 6>get into a room as still as possible.</v>

3369
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:50.450
<v Speaker 6>Take some snaps.</v>

3370
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:51.343
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3371
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.860
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3372
01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:52.880
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3373
01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.630
<v Speaker 6>test it,</v>

3374
01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:53.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3375
01:38:53.901 --> 01:38:54.411
<v Speaker 6>be really,</v>

3376
01:38:54.411 --> 01:38:55.550
<v Speaker 6>really still in that room.</v>

3377
01:38:55.551 --> 01:38:58.280
<v Speaker 6>See if the amount of orbs seems to decrease.</v>

3378
01:38:58.630 --> 01:38:58.881
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3379
01:38:58.881 --> 01:39:00.020
<v Speaker 6>the longer he stays there.</v>

3380
01:39:00.021 --> 01:39:00.950
<v Speaker 6>And I think what he'll find,</v>

3381
01:39:00.951 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 6>cause I mean,</v>

3382
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:04.580
<v Speaker 6>I know some people who who did this is that they go the fuck away because you</v>

3383
01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:07.520
<v Speaker 6>stop stirring up the air that you've now been really still for a while and</v>

3384
01:39:07.521 --> 01:39:07.970
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

3385
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:09.650
<v Speaker 6>and you're taking pictures because generally speaking,</v>

3386
01:39:09.651 --> 01:39:10.370
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's okay.</v>

3387
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:12.320
<v Speaker 6>What about when you get them in outdoor shots,</v>

3388
01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:15.580
<v Speaker 7>bugs and got your bitch</v>

3389
01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.650

3390
01:39:20.651 --> 01:39:23.470
<v Speaker 7>those aliens that just happened to be the bugs,</v>

3391
01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.090
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

3392
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that's a,</v>

3393
01:39:24.991 --> 01:39:27.540
<v Speaker 1>that was a video artifact from I'm filming.</v>

3394
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3395
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:28.531
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3396
01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3397
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 1>those fucking cones,</v>

3398
01:39:30.751 --> 01:39:30.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3399
01:39:30.961 --> 01:39:31.591
<v Speaker 1>those rods,</v>

3400
01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the Roswell rods,</v>

3401
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:32.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3402
01:39:32.881 --> 01:39:33.714
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>

3403
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3404
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I bought that documentary.</v>

3405
01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:37.914
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3406
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:38.803
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

3407
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

3408
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3409
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some war in part of the world where there's a bug that just flies</v>

3410
01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:44.491
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>

3411
01:39:44.491 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 1>It looks really weird.</v>

3412
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think it was that crazy.</v>

3413
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3414
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:47.340
<v Speaker 1>But then they,</v>

3415
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking they're,</v>

3416
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3417
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 1>travelers from another planet.</v>

3418
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:51.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're still always there.</v>

3419
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3420
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:55.410
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that it's just in monster quest broke this,</v>

3421
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:59.280
<v Speaker 1>it took monster quest to debunk you a show.</v>

3422
01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It never gets it.</v>

3423
01:40:00.221 --> 01:40:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

3424
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.110
<v Speaker 1>they never haven't debunk shit except the rods.</v>

3425
01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 1>But the Rod,</v>

3426
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the got your bitch.</v>

3427
01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just a video artifact of certain cameras that when they put like a super</v>

3428
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:10.520
<v Speaker 1>high speed camera on it,</v>

3429
01:40:10.521 --> 01:40:11.354
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen.</v>

3430
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:14.450
<v Speaker 1>They got the exact same area of photographed.</v>

3431
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 1>They lit a fire and bugs would like fly around the fire.</v>

3432
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And when the bugs a fly on the fire on one camera,</v>

3433
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 1>they would come out like these rods cause the camera couldn't compete with it or</v>

3434
01:40:24.001 --> 01:40:26.760
<v Speaker 1>couldn't rather pick up the image when it was moving too fast.</v>

3435
01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Too close to it.</v>

3436
01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It didn't know what it was.</v>

3437
01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Focusing on the front and the back,</v>

3438
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3439
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.990
<v Speaker 1>digital imagery is kind of funky but at the high speed camera and they got it</v>

3440
01:40:33.991 --> 01:40:37.890
<v Speaker 1>loud and clear and it's like a third or it is stupid.</v>

3441
01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:43.420
<v Speaker 1>They this fucking asshole dedicated like decades of his life to selling these</v>

3442
01:40:43.441 --> 01:40:46.950
<v Speaker 1>DVDs and telling everybody that's fucking rods flying around the air.</v>

3443
01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.341
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3444
01:40:48.341 --> 01:40:51.820
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to look for things that would help me answer the big questions if</v>

3445
01:40:51.821 --> 01:40:52.571
<v Speaker 6>only for myself.</v>

3446
01:40:52.571 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 6>I got of like,</v>

3447
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:54.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3448
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to listen to some right wing dogmatic religious person.</v>

3449
01:40:57.731 --> 01:40:58.451
<v Speaker 6>Tell me how it is.</v>

3450
01:40:58.451 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 6>I got tired of listening to Richard Dawkins telling me that I'm just meat and I</v>

3451
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:02.561
<v Speaker 6>just thought,</v>

3452
01:41:02.561 --> 01:41:02.980
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

3453
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:03.250
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

3454
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.020
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

3455
01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 6>if it's knowable,</v>

3456
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:05.890
<v Speaker 6>if it's observable,</v>

3457
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:09.580
<v Speaker 6>that there's more to me than that I should be able to find a way to experience</v>

3458
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 6>this directly for myself and learn about it directly for myself.</v>

3459
01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 6>So I started looking into meditation and Lucid dreaming and trying to find some</v>

3460
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 6>way of experiencing myself in a sense of disconnected from the meat.</v>

3461
01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:21.700
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3462
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.490
<v Speaker 6>My problem with Dawkins is he doesn't seem happy.</v>

3463
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 6>I love,</v>

3464
01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 6>it's not a great advertisement for it.</v>

3465
01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 6>It's a terrible advertise.</v>

3466
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:30.280
<v Speaker 6>He seems like a bitter old cont.</v>

3467
01:41:30.650 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 6>Like I love the idea that he's standing up for science and he's standing up</v>

3468
01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:40.960
<v Speaker 6>against religious ideology and brainwashing and he's,</v>

3469
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.200
<v Speaker 6>but he's doing it in such an hour yet sort of aggressive way that it makes you</v>

3470
01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:46.631
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>

3471
01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:49.740
<v Speaker 6>like you're kind of a bad spokesperson for the thing.</v>

3472
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.360
<v Speaker 6>But I'm sure from the scientific community,</v>

3473
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:57.070
<v Speaker 6>like the encouragement is like so strong and profound and almost hero like that.</v>

3474
01:41:57.071 --> 01:42:00.850
<v Speaker 6>It sort of encourages him to be this aggressive force of reason.</v>

3475
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's enough people like that that he gets the encouragement he</v>

3476
01:42:04.481 --> 01:42:04.781
<v Speaker 6>needs.</v>

3477
01:42:04.781 --> 01:42:05.614
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

3478
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:05.891
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3479
01:42:05.891 --> 01:42:06.724
<v Speaker 6>Peter Higgs,</v>

3480
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:07.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3481
01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.330
<v Speaker 6>the guy who first started us off looking for the Higgs Boson,</v>

3482
01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 6>he recently even just came in and said to Dawkins is a fundamentalist.</v>

3483
01:42:13.730 --> 01:42:18.730
<v Speaker 6>Well you said he's embarrassing Dawkins is his behavior against the or about</v>

3484
01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:19.351
<v Speaker 6>religion?</v>

3485
01:42:19.351 --> 01:42:20.200
<v Speaker 6>It's embarrassing.</v>

3486
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.191
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3487
01:42:21.191 --> 01:42:22.420
<v Speaker 6>And he called him a fundamentalist.</v>

3488
01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:24.250
<v Speaker 6>He said he's an atheist fundamentalist.</v>

3489
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 6>And that's sort of the worst insult that you can level at an atheist because</v>

3490
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:29.111
<v Speaker 6>they are so,</v>

3491
01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:29.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3492
01:42:29.381 --> 01:42:31.150
<v Speaker 6>they were reacting to fundamentalism in their,</v>

3493
01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:31.750
<v Speaker 6>in their view.</v>

3494
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:32.441
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

3495
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:33.820
<v Speaker 6>if you adopt a point of view,</v>

3496
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 6>did that degree with that passion.</v>

3497
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Speaker 6>If it walks like a fundamentalist and talks like a five minutes and quacks like</v>

3498
01:42:40.301 --> 01:42:41.280
<v Speaker 6>a fundamentalist,</v>

3499
01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.040
<v Speaker 6>that's what it is.</v>

3500
01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you that if you could get Richard Dawkins to take place in at least</v>

3501
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:47.410
<v Speaker 6>one mushroom trip,</v>

3502
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.580
<v Speaker 6>if not several.</v>

3503
01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:53.260
<v Speaker 6>I think one to find out what the fuck it is and then reset and revisit,</v>

3504
01:42:53.261 --> 01:42:55.990
<v Speaker 6>go back in and sort of analyze what the fuck is happening.</v>

3505
01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:00.310
<v Speaker 6>I bet he will have a completely different opinion as to the possibilities you</v>

3506
01:43:00.311 --> 01:43:00.671
<v Speaker 6>ever follow.</v>

3507
01:43:00.671 --> 01:43:01.504
<v Speaker 6>The God helmet,</v>

3508
01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:05.290
<v Speaker 6>that's that thing that they put on you and you stimulated certain parts of your</v>

3509
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:06.124
<v Speaker 6>brain,</v>

3510
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:07.980
<v Speaker 6>the temporal lobe with electromagnetic energy.</v>

3511
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:12.490
<v Speaker 6>It's religious experiences and on a lot of other kinds of experiences too.</v>

3512
01:43:12.491 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3513
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3514
01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.890
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is the atheist community,</v>

3515
01:43:14.891 --> 01:43:17.830
<v Speaker 6>that sort of fundamentalist materialist community came out and said,</v>

3516
01:43:17.831 --> 01:43:20.260
<v Speaker 6>this is an explanation for God and religious experience,</v>

3517
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:23.680
<v Speaker 6>but people have all sorts of strange experiences when they put that helmet on.</v>

3518
01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.800
<v Speaker 6>But guess who didn't owe Richard fucking Dawkins and when they screened him</v>

3519
01:43:29.321 --> 01:43:30.900
<v Speaker 6>before he put it on because he,</v>

3520
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:32.830
<v Speaker 6>he wanted to take part in this,</v>

3521
01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:33.550
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3522
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:36.670
<v Speaker 6>when they screened him and put him through sort of the questionnaire they put</v>

3523
01:43:36.671 --> 01:43:37.504
<v Speaker 6>him through.</v>

3524
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:37.751
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

3525
01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:37.930
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3526
01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:40.460
<v Speaker 6>and I have not seen it and so I'm not gonna go to describe this in great detail,</v>

3527
01:43:40.461 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 6>but person you related this much of it to me.</v>

3528
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:43.923
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3529
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 6>when they screened him,</v>

3530
01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3531
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.890
<v Speaker 6>his temporal lobe was really,</v>

3532
01:43:47.891 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 6>really in active,</v>

3533
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:50.560
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3534
01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:50.870
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3535
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3536
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.333
<v Speaker 6>it's</v>

3537
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:53.110
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3538
01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 4>it's not a normal,</v>

3539
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 4>a normally active sort of temporal lobe,</v>

3540
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.280
<v Speaker 4>which is what they were trying to stimulate.</v>

3541
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.730
<v Speaker 4>So when he didn't have an experience person GRE,</v>

3542
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3543
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:03.230
<v Speaker 4>dis sort of dismissed it as saying,</v>

3544
01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:03.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3545
01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:03.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3546
01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:06.770
<v Speaker 4>this guy isn't built like the rest of us.</v>

3547
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:07.041
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3548
01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:08.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's an intriguing thing to think that is,</v>

3549
01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:10.063
<v Speaker 4>is that part of the,</v>

3550
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:13.210
<v Speaker 4>of what created his world view,</v>

3551
01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:13.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3552
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Is Atheistic worldview.</v>

3553
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:15.710
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3554
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:16.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3555
01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:18.310
<v Speaker 1>is that the case or is it just,</v>

3556
01:44:18.311 --> 01:44:23.311
<v Speaker 1>he rejects religion so strong that an area of his brain responsible for religion</v>

3557
01:44:23.411 --> 01:44:24.550
<v Speaker 1>just gets shut down.</v>

3558
01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:24.941
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3559
01:44:24.941 --> 01:44:25.571
<v Speaker 1>That's a great point.</v>

3560
01:44:25.571 --> 01:44:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's,</v>

3561
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:27.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the other possibility,</v>

3562
01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:27.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3563
01:44:27.730 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It could be if that's the,</v>

3564
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3565
01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3566
01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the source of all life,</v>

3567
01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.670
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic hope in that area.</v>

3568
01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Not even unrealistic hope.</v>

3569
01:44:35.201 --> 01:44:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3570
01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe reality,</v>

3571
01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:37.011
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3572
01:44:37.011 --> 01:44:38.140
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which,</v>

3573
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:39.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3574
01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:39.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3575
01:44:39.941 --> 01:44:40.920
<v Speaker 1>we feel it,</v>

3576
01:44:40.921 --> 01:44:41.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3577
01:44:41.111 --> 01:44:42.490
<v Speaker 1>if you pray or if you meditated,</v>

3578
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.590
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like you're contacting something sort of outside yourself?</v>

3579
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 4>This is the part of the brain that processes that information.</v>

3580
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.681
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>

3581
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:50.360
<v Speaker 4>if you're never using that part of the brain,</v>

3582
01:44:50.361 --> 01:44:51.590
<v Speaker 4>if you're never stimulating it,</v>

3583
01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3584
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3585
01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 4>it will become less active.</v>

3586
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.060
<v Speaker 4>That's neuroplasticity in action.</v>

3587
01:44:56.061 --> 01:44:56.540
<v Speaker 4>That's just how it</v>

3588
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:56.931
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

3589
01:44:56.931 --> 01:44:58.060
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

3590
01:44:58.061 --> 01:45:01.150
<v Speaker 1>If you completely reject any idea of Wu whatsoever,</v>

3591
01:45:01.151 --> 01:45:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the woo part of your brand,</v>

3592
01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3593
01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:09.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a big issue that I have with people that will say that an experience,</v>

3594
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.340
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an experience like Edgar Mitchell had,</v>

3595
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:14.950
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's a psychedelic experience,</v>

3596
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:16.630
<v Speaker 1>the they'll say,</v>

3597
01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.730
<v Speaker 1>especially in terms of psychedelic experience,</v>

3598
01:45:18.731 --> 01:45:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I say that it's not real.</v>

3599
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:20.541
<v Speaker 1>Like it's you,</v>

3600
01:45:20.541 --> 01:45:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you had an hallucination but the same effect.</v>

3601
01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.740
<v Speaker 1>It has the same effect rather on you as a real experience.</v>

3602
01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Like even if it's a hallucination,</v>

3603
01:45:32.170 --> 01:45:32.860
<v Speaker 1>let's let's,</v>

3604
01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:36.760
<v Speaker 1>let's defined a hallucination as you're seeing something that's not there.</v>

3605
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's that from that you benefit greatly and you have a real thing is</v>

3606
01:45:44.621 --> 01:45:47.590
<v Speaker 1>going on in your imagination or wherever it is,</v>

3607
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you really are receiving information.</v>

3608
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You really are looking at yourself in the world in a totally different way.</v>

3609
01:45:55.451 --> 01:45:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's actually happening.</v>

3610
01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:57.880
<v Speaker 1>So this event,</v>

3611
01:45:58.150 --> 01:45:59.140
<v Speaker 1>this experience,</v>

3612
01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.131
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

3613
01:46:00.131 --> 01:46:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean we want to compartmentalize it because you're,</v>

3614
01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in some sort of a substance alien to the body that tricks the body</v>

3615
01:46:08.501 --> 01:46:11.590
<v Speaker 1>into having the state and achieving the state and having this experience,</v>

3616
01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:14.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's still an experience that you actually really have.</v>

3617
01:46:15.010 --> 01:46:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

3618
01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.150
<v Speaker 1>can we segue into lucid dreaming because I heard you mentioned that you were</v>

3619
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.420
<v Speaker 4>sit in it and I really,</v>

3620
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.900
<v Speaker 4>maybe the most gratifying thing that's happened to me in writing the book is</v>

3621
01:46:23.901 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 4>whenever I do a public appearance or a podcast with a big enough audience,</v>

3622
01:46:26.871 --> 01:46:29.600
<v Speaker 4>I end up getting notes from people afterwards that they had a lucid dream.</v>

3623
01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Either,</v>

3624
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:31.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3625
01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:34.760
<v Speaker 4>after the interview or after they went and then read the book or whatever it is.</v>

3626
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:36.900
<v Speaker 4>And I love turning people on to it</v>

3627
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:37.990
<v Speaker 1>because you a big,</v>

3628
01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:38.460
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

3629
01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.000
<v Speaker 1>do you do this on a regular basis?</v>

3630
01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I do it on a wrangler</v>

3631
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.060
<v Speaker 4>basis before we had our,</v>

3632
01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:46.080
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I just had fraternal twin boys and I'm there almost six months old.</v>

3633
01:46:46.081 --> 01:46:48.210
<v Speaker 4>So sleep has been hard to come by at home,</v>

3634
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.673
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3635
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm so proud of this.</v>

3636
01:46:50.611 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Right before,</v>

3637
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:53.610
<v Speaker 4>before they came along,</v>

3638
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I was having a lucid dream every two or three weeks without even trying.</v>

3639
01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean just spontaneously because I trained at it long enough,</v>

3640
01:47:00.301 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 4>hard enough that I was having them every two or three weeks,</v>

3641
01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:03.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3642
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.710
<v Speaker 4>since they were born.</v>

3643
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I actually recently,</v>

3644
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 4>cause they're starting to sleep a little bit now.</v>

3645
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 4>I actually had a couple just in the last couple of weeks and it's over three</v>

3646
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>

3647
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:12.503
<v Speaker 4>I had to.</v>

3648
01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:13.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3649
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:13.681
<v Speaker 4>oh great.</v>

3650
01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:14.640
<v Speaker 4>It's coming back online.</v>

3651
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:19.380
<v Speaker 4>This function of Steve Volk is returning now that he's getting proper rest,</v>

3652
01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:19.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3653
01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:20.694
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

3654
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:21.200
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

3655
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.290
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty terrific.</v>

3656
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.630
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3657
01:47:22.630 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 4>and one of the great things about it is that it changes your waking life as well</v>

3658
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:28.230
<v Speaker 4>as your dreaming life.</v>

3659
01:47:28.231 --> 01:47:28.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3660
01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:32.520
<v Speaker 4>it honestly wouldn't be worth the effort if you were only doing it to experience</v>

3661
01:47:32.521 --> 01:47:34.680
<v Speaker 4>a change in your consciousness when you're dreaming.</v>

3662
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:38.850
<v Speaker 4>So lucid dreaming for those that don't know is the act of being aware and you're</v>

3663
01:47:38.851 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 4>dreaming while you're dreaming and then choosing accordingly.</v>

3664
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3665
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.950
<v Speaker 4>So think of it this way.</v>

3666
01:47:43.951 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 4>One great way of introducing people to the idea is that we're going to talk</v>

3667
01:47:48.121 --> 01:47:49.550
<v Speaker 4>about the fill tank at four more hours.</v>

3668
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 4>One of the ways of introducing people to lucid dreaming to understand what it</v>

3669
01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 4>really is and,</v>

3670
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.070
<v Speaker 4>and usually I'm asking this if like a crowded book reading or something,</v>

3671
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.480
<v Speaker 4>but I'll ask you guys here,</v>

3672
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 4>have any of you ever woken yourself up from a nightmare?</v>

3673
01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3674
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3675
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 4>You were this close to having a lucid dreaming Gillette having a lucid dream</v>

3676
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 4>because you are aware you were dreaming while you're dreaming.</v>

3677
01:48:10.231 --> 01:48:10.620
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3678
01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:10.951
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

3679
01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:11.784
<v Speaker 4>this is a nightmare,</v>

3680
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:12.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3681
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to wake myself up and you chose to wake yourself up.</v>

3682
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is,</v>

3683
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:19.420
<v Speaker 4>since whatever was chasing you or whatever was happening that made it qualify as</v>

3684
01:48:19.421 --> 01:48:20.190
<v Speaker 4>a nightmare,</v>

3685
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.600
<v Speaker 4>had no external reality,</v>

3686
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.640
<v Speaker 4>you could have just walked away from it and your dream,</v>

3687
01:48:23.641 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 4>you could have,</v>

3688
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 4>because the laws of physics don't apply,</v>

3689
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:27.180
<v Speaker 4>flown away from it.</v>

3690
01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:28.740
<v Speaker 4>You could have gone up to it and said,</v>

3691
01:48:28.741 --> 01:48:29.340
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

3692
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:29.610
<v Speaker 4>what's up?</v>

3693
01:48:29.610 --> 01:48:30.510
<v Speaker 4>Why are you chasing me?</v>

3694
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Completely control your room.</v>

3695
01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3696
01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.241
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3697
01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:35.220
<v Speaker 4>you control you within your dream.</v>

3698
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:39.720
<v Speaker 4>And for some people they find that they can begin to control other aspects of it</v>

3699
01:48:39.721 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 4>and make things happen.</v>

3700
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:45.980
<v Speaker 4>I had one that was totally like I could stop time and we wind the tape and,</v>

3701
01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 4>and started again.</v>

3702
01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream that I was in a cracks and,</v>

3703
01:48:49.341 --> 01:48:49.531
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3704
01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:51.510
<v Speaker 4>and I got lucid and I'm,</v>

3705
01:48:51.511 --> 01:48:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually already was really outing myself here.</v>

3706
01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:54.990
<v Speaker 4>I always had a phobia about driving.</v>

3707
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:55.500
<v Speaker 4>I do it.</v>

3708
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.333
<v Speaker 4>I've never enjoyed it.</v>

3709
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3710
01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 4>But Lucid dreaming really helped me push past that.</v>

3711
01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3712
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:04.860
<v Speaker 4>and one of the ways was I was having this recurring nightmare.</v>

3713
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.111
<v Speaker 4>This is not one,</v>

3714
01:49:06.111 --> 01:49:06.571
<v Speaker 4>it's in the book.</v>

3715
01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:08.730
<v Speaker 4>This is a bonus baby and there's a different nightmare.</v>

3716
01:49:08.731 --> 01:49:09.564
<v Speaker 4>I dealt with in the book.</v>

3717
01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:10.693
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3718
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:14.340
<v Speaker 4>I had this recurring dream that I would find myself outside the car,</v>

3719
01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:16.490
<v Speaker 4>but the car was,</v>

3720
01:49:16.491 --> 01:49:17.500
<v Speaker 4>but I was driving the car.</v>

3721
01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:22.020
<v Speaker 4>So there was like a me watching and then it me driving and I would rack because</v>

3722
01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:24.630
<v Speaker 4>I felt myself not in control of the car.</v>

3723
01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 4>And so I finally had a lucid dream.</v>

3724
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I got got lucid and realizes,</v>

3725
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:28.381
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3726
01:49:28.381 --> 01:49:33.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean in this fricking recurring dream and I kept crashing the car from this</v>

3727
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:36.310
<v Speaker 4>distance and I would just rewind it and,</v>

3728
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.340
<v Speaker 4>and try and get better control of it.</v>

3729
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:40.980
<v Speaker 4>But I kept trying to get better control of it from a distance.</v>

3730
01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:45.210
<v Speaker 4>And so finally I just kind of Zap myself into the body that was driving the car,</v>

3731
01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.100
<v Speaker 4>the me that was actually driving the car.</v>

3732
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.591
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3733
01:49:47.591 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 4>well shit,</v>

3734
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I just need to drive the car.</v>

3735
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:51.700
<v Speaker 4>I need to actually be behind the wheel.</v>

3736
01:49:51.701 --> 01:49:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Not In this disconnected way,</v>

3737
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 4>but in this present way.</v>

3738
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I realize what the dream had been telling me.</v>

3739
01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:01.160
<v Speaker 4>How you purposely got involved in the idea of lucid dreaming for the book.</v>

3740
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:05.860
<v Speaker 4>So how did you go about manifesting a lucid dream?</v>

3741
01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:06.221
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3742
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:06.780
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3743
01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3744
01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:12.210
<v Speaker 4>I started researching the main guy who has studied lucid dreaming,</v>

3745
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.110
<v Speaker 4>proved it was real and it holds for thing.</v>

3746
01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Doctor Steven Lubbers started reading his book and planning to go to Hawaii for</v>

3747
01:50:18.581 --> 01:50:21.210
<v Speaker 4>his 10 day workshop and I started convenient.</v>

3748
01:50:21.211 --> 01:50:22.780
<v Speaker 4>He has a 10 day workshop in Hawaii.</v>

3749
01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3750
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.160
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool.</v>

3751
01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3752
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:27.400
<v Speaker 4>I highly recommend vacation.</v>

3753
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:28.750
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible vacation.</v>

3754
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:29.650
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3755
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:30.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3756
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 4>and it's a vacation that tapped me into it,</v>

3757
01:50:31.781 --> 01:50:33.190
<v Speaker 4>like a whole new lingo of my life.</v>

3758
01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:34.540
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3759
01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:35.374
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3760
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:36.610
<v Speaker 4>it's the act of being aware.</v>

3761
01:50:36.611 --> 01:50:38.530
<v Speaker 4>You're dreaming while you're dreaming and choosing accordingly.</v>

3762
01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:42.400
<v Speaker 4>And the F I realized once I read that,</v>

3763
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:45.340
<v Speaker 4>that I had woken myself up from nightmares for years.</v>

3764
01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:47.110
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>

3765
01:50:47.111 --> 01:50:47.321
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3766
01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I have an opportunity to do something different here.</v>

3767
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 4>So there's different ways you can train for it.</v>

3768
01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 4>One of them is you take the time to remember,</v>

3769
01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3770
01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:56.501
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

3771
01:50:56.501 --> 01:50:58.900
<v Speaker 4>a reoccurring dream or the dream you had last night.</v>

3772
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.530
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3773
01:50:59.530 --> 01:51:02.380
<v Speaker 4>I really recommend doing it with a recurring dream.</v>

3774
01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 4>You remember it particularly a nightmare because those are so vivid.</v>

3775
01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.593
<v Speaker 4>You remember it,</v>

3776
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like a meditation.</v>

3777
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:13.150
<v Speaker 4>You meditate on it and you choose the point in the dream where you wish you had</v>

3778
01:51:13.151 --> 01:51:13.984
<v Speaker 4>become lucid,</v>

3779
01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 4>where you wish you had gained control.</v>

3780
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

3781
01:51:17.711 --> 01:51:21.820
<v Speaker 4>the dream and the book that I had worked with was a dream where this creepy dude</v>

3782
01:51:21.821 --> 01:51:26.821
<v Speaker 4>shows up outside my house and he's peeking in through the window and eventually</v>

3783
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:29.590
<v Speaker 4>I end up getting angry that he's trying to terrorize me.</v>

3784
01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:30.760
<v Speaker 4>And I opened the door and we would,</v>

3785
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:31.481
<v Speaker 4>we would fight,</v>

3786
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:35.410
<v Speaker 4>we would clash and I would wake up literally at times punching the air just</v>

3787
01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going after this guy.</v>

3788
01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 4>So I decided to meditate on that dream and look for the spot within that dream</v>

3789
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:43.840
<v Speaker 4>where I could,</v>

3790
01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:44.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3791
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:45.723
<v Speaker 4>get lucid.</v>

3792
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.040
<v Speaker 4>And Gosh,</v>

3793
01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how long I at this point in,</v>

3794
01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:50.950
<v Speaker 4>it's in the book,</v>

3795
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:51.221
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

3796
01:51:51.221 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 4>it was probably a couple of weeks of,</v>

3797
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.210
<v Speaker 4>of work where maybe 10 minutes,</v>

3798
01:51:55.211 --> 01:51:55.751
<v Speaker 4>one day,</v>

3799
01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.351
<v Speaker 4>five minutes,</v>

3800
01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 4>the next,</v>

3801
01:51:56.770 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 4>maybe the 15 minutes before I fell asleep one night.</v>

3802
01:51:59.290 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 4>And finally the dream happened.</v>

3803
01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.680
<v Speaker 4>And when the guys showed up in,</v>

3804
01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:04.150
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3805
01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:04.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3806
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:05.380
<v Speaker 4>my window,</v>

3807
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:06.940
<v Speaker 4>I realized,</v>

3808
01:52:06.941 --> 01:52:07.241
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

3809
01:52:07.241 --> 01:52:08.074
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3810
01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:09.610
<v Speaker 4>remember this is the dream.</v>

3811
01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:10.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm dreaming.</v>

3812
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 4>And to feel yourself like,</v>

3813
01:52:12.431 --> 01:52:13.264
<v Speaker 4>to feel this.</v>

3814
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize it until you've had a lucid dream,</v>

3815
01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.320
<v Speaker 4>but this youth,</v>

3816
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a sense of disconnect between you and the in the u and the dream,</v>

3817
01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.113
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3818
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Until you lucid dream and suddenly find yourself in this dream body,</v>

3819
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:27.220
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3820
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.110
<v Speaker 4>you're no longer watching it like a movie.</v>

3821
01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:32.290
<v Speaker 4>You are in it and it's like the Matrix.</v>

3822
01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:32.890
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3823
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:33.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3824
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 4>you get to be neo.</v>

3825
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:36.480
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly the,</v>

3826
01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.361
<v Speaker 4>as I said before,</v>

3827
01:52:37.361 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 4>the laws of physics,</v>

3828
01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Plano part in,</v>

3829
01:52:39.311 --> 01:52:41.800
<v Speaker 4>most people find when they really begin,</v>

3830
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:43.570
<v Speaker 4>when they first have a lucid dream,</v>

3831
01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:46.390
<v Speaker 4>there's this exhibit exhilarating sort of feeling</v>

3832
01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:48.460
<v Speaker 1>flying and dream sex.</v>

3833
01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Like those are the first things that people usually do this on.</v>

3834
01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Anybody wants to fly him?</v>

3835
01:52:52.091 --> 01:52:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

3836
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.010
<v Speaker 1>they banked some honey or they take off and it just lets you know that what is</v>

3837
01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.090
<v Speaker 1>what is best in life.</v>

3838
01:52:58.091 --> 01:52:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Conan was right,</v>

3839
01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:01.330
<v Speaker 1>he was right.</v>

3840
01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Everybody running around.</v>

3841
01:53:02.501 --> 01:53:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I just want support and have friends.</v>

3842
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:04.663
<v Speaker 1>The Fuck Outta here.</v>

3843
01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:06.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you're in your dream?</v>

3844
01:53:06.061 --> 01:53:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Did you make some friends?</v>

3845
01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:07.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3846
01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:08.021
<v Speaker 1>You fucking,</v>

3847
01:53:08.021 --> 01:53:08.854
<v Speaker 1>you fly.</v>

3848
01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:10.433
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3849
01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I have found that when I,</v>

3850
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.500
<v Speaker 4>we're doomed when I don't,</v>

3851
01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:16.470
<v Speaker 4>when I don't have a plan in a lucid dream,</v>

3852
01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:17.490
<v Speaker 4>I spontaneously,</v>

3853
01:53:17.491 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I think to do,</v>

3854
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.661
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3855
01:53:18.661 --> 01:53:19.950
<v Speaker 4>because you can plan activities,</v>

3856
01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.530
<v Speaker 4>you can say I want to have a conversation with so and so.</v>

3857
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.321
<v Speaker 4>I've had a lot of,</v>

3858
01:53:23.321 --> 01:53:24.800
<v Speaker 4>a fair amount of deaths in my family.</v>

3859
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:25.740
<v Speaker 4>My Mom's Dad,</v>

3860
01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.780
<v Speaker 4>my oldest brother is dead.</v>

3861
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:29.970
<v Speaker 4>A brother in law who was very much like a brother to me.</v>

3862
01:53:29.971 --> 01:53:31.320
<v Speaker 4>He was in the family since I was 12.</v>

3863
01:53:31.321 --> 01:53:32.460
<v Speaker 4>We shared a room together.</v>

3864
01:53:32.850 --> 01:53:33.031
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3865
01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:33.721
<v Speaker 4>he's dead.</v>

3866
01:53:33.721 --> 01:53:35.130
<v Speaker 4>I had two friends die of cancer.</v>

3867
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3868
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:40.380
<v Speaker 4>and right around the time that the book where I was working on the book and um,</v>

3869
01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to see my mother again.</v>

3870
01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.730
<v Speaker 4>So I had a lucid dream in which,</v>

3871
01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:44.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3872
01:53:44.971 --> 01:53:46.380
<v Speaker 4>I remembered that that's what I wanted.</v>

3873
01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.450
<v Speaker 4>And I called out into the dream,</v>

3874
01:53:48.451 --> 01:53:49.410
<v Speaker 4>show me my mother,</v>

3875
01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:50.730
<v Speaker 4>show me,</v>

3876
01:53:50.730 --> 01:53:51.541
<v Speaker 4>show me my brother,</v>

3877
01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:52.620
<v Speaker 4>show me my brother in law.</v>

3878
01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.030
<v Speaker 4>And suddenly I was in,</v>

3879
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:55.103
<v Speaker 4>I was in the kind of like,</v>

3880
01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:56.041
<v Speaker 4>when the dream started,</v>

3881
01:53:56.041 --> 01:54:00.090
<v Speaker 4>I was in kind of like a mall and I got lucid because Leonardo Dicaprio showed up</v>

3882
01:54:00.091 --> 01:54:02.250
<v Speaker 4>and shoved me and I realized it's Fucking Weird,</v>

3883
01:54:02.251 --> 01:54:03.210
<v Speaker 4>leaner decapitation Oh,</v>

3884
01:54:03.211 --> 01:54:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a dream.</v>

3885
01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:04.171
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3886
01:54:04.171 --> 01:54:04.860
<v Speaker 4>That's how I,</v>

3887
01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:06.030
<v Speaker 4>that's how I gained lucidity.</v>

3888
01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:07.410
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

3889
01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.170
<v Speaker 4>and I remembered what it was and I wanted to be there for,</v>

3890
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:11.580
<v Speaker 4>and so when I called out,</v>

3891
01:54:11.581 --> 01:54:12.480
<v Speaker 4>show me my mother,</v>

3892
01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:16.560
<v Speaker 4>it was like the mall disappeared and there I was just in this black space.</v>

3893
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:21.840
<v Speaker 4>And then my mom was there and this is years after she died.</v>

3894
01:54:21.841 --> 01:54:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I got to hug her and it felt every bit is real,</v>

3895
01:54:26.041 --> 01:54:26.851
<v Speaker 4>is really doing it.</v>

3896
01:54:26.851 --> 01:54:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I could feel her warm,</v>

3897
01:54:27.991 --> 01:54:28.890
<v Speaker 4>soft skin.</v>

3898
01:54:28.891 --> 01:54:30.240
<v Speaker 4>I could feel the bones under the skin.</v>

3899
01:54:30.241 --> 01:54:34.120
<v Speaker 4>I could smell her shampoo that she used on her hair,</v>

3900
01:54:34.121 --> 01:54:34.651
<v Speaker 4>that should,</v>

3901
01:54:34.651 --> 01:54:35.700
<v Speaker 4>I had not even thought of.</v>

3902
01:54:35.730 --> 01:54:36.361
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3903
01:54:36.361 --> 01:54:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>

3904
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:38.460
<v Speaker 4>that were memories of hugging my mother.</v>

3905
01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:39.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3906
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:40.921
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful,</v>

3907
01:54:40.921 --> 01:54:41.641
<v Speaker 4>beautiful experience.</v>

3908
01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:42.140
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

3909
01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.400
<v Speaker 4>I called for my brother and my brother and I,</v>

3910
01:54:43.401 --> 01:54:43.801
<v Speaker 4>they were there.</v>

3911
01:54:43.801 --> 01:54:45.240
<v Speaker 4>We ended up doing like kind of a group hug.</v>

3912
01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:46.531
<v Speaker 4>So it was really nice.</v>

3913
01:54:46.531 --> 01:54:48.840
<v Speaker 4>What do you think is going on when you're having a lucid dream?</v>

3914
01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:50.123
<v Speaker 4>I think you're dreaming,</v>

3915
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:51.143
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3916
01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.230
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

3917
01:54:52.230 --> 01:54:55.600
<v Speaker 1>what is it allowing you to piece together this artificial reality?</v>

3918
01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:55.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3919
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:56.350
<v Speaker 1>they're not</v>

3920
01:54:56.350 --> 01:54:57.183
<v Speaker 4>Carly.</v>

3921
01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:58.043
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3922
01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:58.960
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3923
01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 4>what's allowing you to dream?</v>

3924
01:54:59.841 --> 01:55:00.280
<v Speaker 4>And we'll say,</v>

3925
01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.113
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

3926
01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.073
<v Speaker 4>people think of</v>

3927
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 1>sleep as losing consciousness.</v>

3928
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.580
<v Speaker 1>The fact is what you lose is awareness.</v>

3929
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:10.880
<v Speaker 1>You're conscious because you're able to report what happened afterward.</v>

3930
01:55:10.881 --> 01:55:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Or at least most of us have some memory of,</v>

3931
01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:16.400
<v Speaker 1>of our dreams entering into another dimension.</v>

3932
01:55:16.670 --> 01:55:17.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3933
01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>so dreaming is what happens in the absence of external input,</v>

3934
01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3935
01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting any external input anymore.</v>

3936
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>This is just our mind,</v>

3937
01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:25.963
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3938
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Can we call that another dimension?</v>

3939
01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:29.870
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

3940
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:32.030
<v Speaker 1>the dimension of imagination,</v>

3941
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:33.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that is,</v>

3942
01:55:33.381 --> 01:55:35.240
<v Speaker 1>however it exists in whatever,</v>

3943
01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3944
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:37.243
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3945
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:37.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3946
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:38.181
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

3947
01:55:38.181 --> 01:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it plays out in theirs.</v>

3948
01:55:39.690 --> 01:55:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It's going on somewhere.</v>

3949
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:41.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3950
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 1>whether it's just a bunch of firing inside</v>

3951
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:44.551
<v Speaker 6>your head,</v>

3952
01:55:44.551 --> 01:55:45.750
<v Speaker 6>it's not really real.</v>

3953
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 6>At least inside your head.</v>

3954
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 6>There's a whole fake world.</v>

3955
01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:51.120
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that?</v>

3956
01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

3957
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.960
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

3958
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.760
<v Speaker 6>That's the mystery of consciousness,</v>

3959
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3960
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:55.200
<v Speaker 6>That's the mystery of consciousness.</v>

3961
01:55:55.610 --> 01:55:56.000
<v Speaker 6>Where'd,</v>

3962
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.930
<v Speaker 6>where does this experience really come from?</v>

3963
01:55:57.931 --> 01:55:59.940
<v Speaker 6>How could the neurons,</v>

3964
01:55:59.941 --> 01:56:04.770
<v Speaker 6>this three pound gelatinous mass secreting and emitting chemicals and electrical</v>

3965
01:56:04.771 --> 01:56:07.920
<v Speaker 6>firings create this in any,</v>

3966
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 6>the truth of this is that we don't fucking know.</v>

3967
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:11.921
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3968
01:56:11.921 --> 01:56:15.260
<v Speaker 6>and yet we're inundated with people telling us what,</v>

3969
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:17.840
<v Speaker 6>what we should consider important and,</v>

3970
01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:21.600
<v Speaker 6>and telling us at this point to just drilling us with this kind of materialist</v>

3971
01:56:21.601 --> 01:56:22.780
<v Speaker 6>paradigm that you,</v>

3972
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 6>that we are meet computers,</v>

3973
01:56:24.661 --> 01:56:26.030
<v Speaker 6>that we have no freewill.</v>

3974
01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 6>All this sort of to me,</v>

3975
01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:28.501
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3976
01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:29.334
<v Speaker 6>just sort of,</v>

3977
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't buy that the no free will thing.</v>

3978
01:56:31.801 --> 01:56:32.634
<v Speaker 6>And I think if,</v>

3979
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.400
<v Speaker 6>if they don't know how to explain it,</v>

3980
01:56:35.401 --> 01:56:36.234
<v Speaker 6>how am no free,</v>

3981
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:37.650
<v Speaker 6>how we have freewill.</v>

3982
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:41.820
<v Speaker 6>It's because we don't know yet enough about the brain and consciousness.</v>

3983
01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:42.630
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3984
01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:42.901
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3985
01:56:42.901 --> 01:56:43.830
<v Speaker 6>and I love Sam Harris.</v>

3986
01:56:43.831 --> 01:56:48.270
<v Speaker 6>Sam Harris really turned me on to meditation through reading his book and I</v>

3987
01:56:48.271 --> 01:56:50.220
<v Speaker 6>consider him like sort of among the new atheists,</v>

3988
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:51.120
<v Speaker 6>he is a breed apart.</v>

3989
01:56:51.121 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 6>I love the interview you did with him because he admits that the paranormals</v>

3990
01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.360
<v Speaker 6>been unfairly stigmatized and,</v>

3991
01:56:56.361 --> 01:56:57.194
<v Speaker 6>and all this sort of stuff.</v>

3992
01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:00.150
<v Speaker 6>But he's one of the guys out there trumpeting that we have no free will.</v>

3993
01:57:00.151 --> 01:57:04.770
<v Speaker 6>And I am really happy for the opportunity to talk about this because,</v>

3994
01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:05.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3995
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:10.850
<v Speaker 6>and he says rightly that a dogmatic religion has an unhealthy effect on,</v>

3996
01:57:11.230 --> 01:57:12.150
<v Speaker 6>on the psyche.</v>

3997
01:57:12.151 --> 01:57:15.620
<v Speaker 6>And it certainly does for a lot of people write it as a healthy on effect on</v>

3998
01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:17.010
<v Speaker 6>people in society.</v>

3999
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.120
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4000
01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:18.481
<v Speaker 6>because they're,</v>

4001
01:57:18.481 --> 01:57:18.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4002
01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:19.464
<v Speaker 6>they're fearful,</v>

4003
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 6>they're judgmental of other people and all this sort of stuff.</v>

4004
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:26.010
<v Speaker 6>But when you tell people they have no freewill,</v>

4005
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:28.410
<v Speaker 6>they are more likely to cheat.</v>

4006
01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Umm,</v>

4007
01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 6>and this has been researched,</v>

4008
01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4009
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:35.190
<v Speaker 6>When you expose people to the idea that they have no free will and then you give</v>

4010
01:57:35.191 --> 01:57:37.420
<v Speaker 6>them an opportunity to cheat,</v>

4011
01:57:37.421 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 6>it's something they'll do it.</v>

4012
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 6>And if you tell people,</v>

4013
01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:41.813
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4014
01:57:42.150 --> 01:57:42.720
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4015
01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 6>was the other one,</v>

4016
01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:43.530
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4017
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:44.730
<v Speaker 6>they did this as games,</v>

4018
01:57:44.731 --> 01:57:47.150
<v Speaker 6>anything or it was a test.</v>

4019
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:49.710
<v Speaker 6>It was an academic test and they cheated him,</v>

4020
01:57:49.711 --> 01:57:53.110
<v Speaker 6>cheat on an academic test because they were told they have no freewill.</v>

4021
01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:56.340
<v Speaker 6>So they were more Bo's idea that they most likely had no freewill.</v>

4022
01:57:56.970 --> 01:57:58.440
<v Speaker 6>And the control group who was not,</v>

4023
01:57:58.441 --> 01:58:00.480
<v Speaker 6>was not exposed to that information,</v>

4024
01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:04.080
<v Speaker 6>didn't cheat as much as the people who are anywhere near as much as the people</v>

4025
01:58:04.081 --> 01:58:07.620
<v Speaker 6>who had been exposed to the idea that we have no free will.</v>

4026
01:58:07.710 --> 01:58:11.580
<v Speaker 6>And when you say that Sam Harris believes that we have no freewill,</v>

4027
01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.390
<v Speaker 6>we should kind of does.</v>

4028
01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:18.400
<v Speaker 6>It's a very comprehensive sort of a take on things that has to do with not just</v>

4029
01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:20.250
<v Speaker 6>natural selection,</v>

4030
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

4031
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:21.100
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4032
01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:26.040
<v Speaker 6>the human organism itself and all the reward systems that are put in place to</v>

4033
01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:27.270
<v Speaker 6>motivate behavior.</v>

4034
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:28.320
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

4035
01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:33.320
<v Speaker 6>it's not like he believes that there's an architect that's guiding your life.</v>

4036
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.371
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

4037
01:58:34.371 --> 01:58:34.530
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4038
01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:34.980
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4039
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:36.390
<v Speaker 6>I just want to let everybody else,</v>

4040
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4041
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:38.810
<v Speaker 6>when you say you have no free will,</v>

4042
01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:39.690
<v Speaker 6>like to,</v>

4043
01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:41.220
<v Speaker 6>for a lot of people with a religious,</v>

4044
01:58:41.610 --> 01:58:42.390
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

4045
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:43.980
<v Speaker 1>A fundamental idea and that's he's,</v>

4046
01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.420
<v Speaker 1>he's more,</v>

4047
01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:49.680
<v Speaker 1>he's looking at it completely the opposite from a scientific perspective.</v>

4048
01:58:49.681 --> 01:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that you're motivated constantly by a series of factors that are</v>

4049
01:58:54.151 --> 01:58:54.984
<v Speaker 1>beyond your control.</v>

4050
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.621
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>

4051
01:58:55.621 --> 01:58:56.880
<v Speaker 1>if this is a completely just,</v>

4052
01:58:56.881 --> 01:58:57.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4053
01:58:57.091 --> 01:58:59.400
<v Speaker 1>sort of a naturalistic material universe,</v>

4054
01:58:59.790 --> 01:59:03.030
<v Speaker 1>if we could measure all the variables from the big bang until now,</v>

4055
01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:06.750
<v Speaker 1>we could predict everything and you're going to do your entire life,</v>

4056
01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.710
<v Speaker 1>every choice you're going to make because it's all the result of the conditions</v>

4057
01:59:10.711 --> 01:59:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that that led up to it.</v>

4058
01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4059
01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and other crazy idea once of taking a computer that's so powerful that you could</v>

4060
01:59:18.541 --> 01:59:23.541
<v Speaker 1>input in all of the data of everything in the state that it exists right now in</v>

4061
01:59:23.911 --> 01:59:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

4062
01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:25.740
<v Speaker 1>everything that exists in the world,</v>

4063
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:27.480
<v Speaker 1>in the state that it exists right now,</v>

4064
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and from that you could extrapolate and go back through time and get a full</v>

4065
01:59:32.881 --> 01:59:36.900
<v Speaker 1>detailed depiction of every single event that took place.</v>

4066
01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:40.530
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely ridiculous right now,</v>

4067
01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's ridiculous in the future.</v>

4068
01:59:42.571 --> 01:59:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be able to get data from,</v>

4069
01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm like whoever thought like a million years ago,</v>

4070
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to get ice samples and that,</v>

4071
01:59:49.001 --> 01:59:50.970
<v Speaker 1>that was going to tell you a climate change,</v>

4072
01:59:50.971 --> 01:59:51.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4073
01:59:51.121 --> 01:59:52.810
<v Speaker 1>from thousands and thousands a year.</v>

4074
01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we know what the fuck was going on 6,000 years ago.</v>

4075
01:59:56.130 --> 01:59:58.140
<v Speaker 1>You drill a gigantic chunk of ice and go,</v>

4076
01:59:58.141 --> 01:59:58.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4077
01:59:58.341 --> 02:00:00.810
<v Speaker 1>shit was different here and looking at a foot higher,</v>

4078
02:00:00.811 --> 02:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>it's different here.</v>

4079
02:00:01.770 --> 02:00:02.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4080
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:03.573
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4081
02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:04.400
<v Speaker 4>can I,</v>

4082
02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:05.790
<v Speaker 4>if I can take this back to lucid dreaming.</v>

4083
02:00:05.850 --> 02:00:06.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4084
02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:06.480
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

4085
02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.770
<v Speaker 4>So another way of,</v>

4086
02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:11.100
<v Speaker 4>and this is the part that really gets beneficial for your daily life.</v>

4087
02:00:11.130 --> 02:00:13.440
<v Speaker 4>The part that was most powerful for me in that sense.</v>

4088
02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4089
02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.800
<v Speaker 4>the other way you can train yourself to have a lucid dream.</v>

4090
02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:17.491
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

4091
02:00:17.491 --> 02:00:18.660
<v Speaker 4>you have to ask yourself the question,</v>

4092
02:00:18.661 --> 02:00:20.640
<v Speaker 4>how do you know when you're awake or when you're dreaming,</v>

4093
02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:21.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4094
02:00:21.450 --> 02:00:21.700
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

4095
02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:26.160
<v Speaker 4>how do you know what's different and what a lubbers found and what everybody</v>

4096
02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:28.490
<v Speaker 4>else subsequently is found is that there,</v>

4097
02:00:28.590 --> 02:00:33.300
<v Speaker 4>there's this kind of state tests you can do to see which state you're in.</v>

4098
02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:35.280
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is to start doing it.</v>

4099
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:37.170
<v Speaker 4>When you're awake,</v>

4100
02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:38.070
<v Speaker 4>do it all the time.</v>

4101
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.560
<v Speaker 4>It should probably come from some Q and the environment.</v>

4102
02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:42.750
<v Speaker 4>If something odd happens where you just think,</v>

4103
02:00:42.751 --> 02:00:42.871
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4104
02:00:42.871 --> 02:00:43.800
<v Speaker 4>that's strange,</v>

4105
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:45.450
<v Speaker 4>lock into that.</v>

4106
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:46.080
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4107
02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.790
<v Speaker 4>And here's how you would do a state test.</v>

4108
02:00:48.110 --> 02:00:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4109
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.510
<v Speaker 4>print changes in a dream.</v>

4110
02:00:51.511 --> 02:00:52.650
<v Speaker 4>If you look at it,</v>

4111
02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.590
<v Speaker 4>something printed and then look away and then look back.</v>

4112
02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:56.873
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4113
02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:58.320
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you have to do it a couple of times.</v>

4114
02:00:58.740 --> 02:00:59.070
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

4115
02:00:59.070 --> 02:00:59.821
<v Speaker 4>it will change.</v>

4116
02:00:59.821 --> 02:01:02.370
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is because that print doesn't have any external reality.</v>

4117
02:01:02.371 --> 02:01:06.960
<v Speaker 4>It's something that your mind is producing a for you.</v>

4118
02:01:06.961 --> 02:01:07.794
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4119
02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.071
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4120
02:01:08.071 --> 02:01:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

4121
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:09.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4122
02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.140
<v Speaker 4>print at one point.</v>

4123
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:11.430
<v Speaker 4>I usually,</v>

4124
02:01:11.431 --> 02:01:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I've just been able to figure out,</v>

4125
02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I just kind of lock into it and get,</v>

4126
02:01:14.610 --> 02:01:14.911
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4127
02:01:14.911 --> 02:01:15.690
<v Speaker 4>this is a dream.</v>

4128
02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Like Leonardo Dicaprio,</v>

4129
02:01:16.591 --> 02:01:17.424
<v Speaker 4>push it,</v>

4130
02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>push through and it was out in real life and all sudden you thought you were in</v>

4131
02:01:21.361 --> 02:01:21.721
<v Speaker 1>a dream.</v>

4132
02:01:21.721 --> 02:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>She started fucking random people having sex with Leah.</v>

4133
02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man?</v>

4134
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was lucid dreaming.</v>

4135
02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Well this is why this is why you might want to do a state.</v>

4136
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4137
02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:30.360
<v Speaker 4>As well,</v>

4138
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:30.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4139
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4140
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:34.170
<v Speaker 4>And so you check print and you see if the print changed and I had print change</v>

4141
02:01:34.171 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 4>and to just um,</v>

4142
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 4>like symbols at 1.0 book just changed into a series of incomprehensible symbols.</v>

4143
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4144
02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.470
<v Speaker 6>digital clocks,</v>

4145
02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4146
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.610
<v Speaker 6>will really malfunction and machinery in general will not function because you</v>

4147
02:01:46.611 --> 02:01:46.671
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

4148
02:01:46.671 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 6>you flip that light switch over there and it's actually connected to the light</v>

4149
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:50.294
<v Speaker 6>bulbs.</v>

4150
02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:51.740
<v Speaker 6>But in the dream it's not</v>

4151
02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>anything you flip the light switch and maybe the light goes on the first time.</v>

4152
02:01:56.241 --> 02:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Then when you turn it off it doesn't go off because it's not actually connected</v>

4153
02:01:59.691 --> 02:01:59.901
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

4154
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4155
02:02:00.051 --> 02:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I've had that happen in June was four where I realized it was lucid because I</v>

4156
02:02:02.871 --> 02:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>couldn't turn the light switches on and off.</v>

4157
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I've had that and so I realized,</v>

4158
02:02:06.690 --> 02:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4159
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>this is a lucid dream.</v>

4160
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a dream.</v>

4161
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Ed,</v>

4162
02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>did you do anything with that?</v>

4163
02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4164
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:11.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4165
02:02:11.631 --> 02:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>when I started taking nootropics,</v>

4166
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I had much more success with lucid dreaming.</v>

4167
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I've found that my lucid dreams before where we're so fragile,</v>

4168
02:02:22.251 --> 02:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>they were like a bubble,</v>

4169
02:02:23.391 --> 02:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>like a child's bubble,</v>

4170
02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4171
02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>when they blow with those things.</v>

4172
02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>But then once I started taking nootropics,</v>

4173
02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>there were like a fucking volleyball and I was like hard,</v>

4174
02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you can kick it around like it was,</v>

4175
02:02:34.341 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it was different.</v>

4176
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:35.833
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't pop it.</v>

4177
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to take my on.</v>

4178
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4179
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Any new tropics,</v>

4180
02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:40.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4181
02:02:40.551 --> 02:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I obviously we sell on it products because they're the best that we can possibly</v>

4182
02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

4183
02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>We sell the best shit we can sell.</v>

4184
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not anyway,</v>

4185
02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:48.741
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

4186
02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:49.574
<v Speaker 1>if you're skeptical,</v>

4187
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:53.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of ingredients that the GRI ingredients are available online.</v>

4188
02:02:53.421 --> 02:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Take any of those and whether in conjunction or individually,</v>

4189
02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different companies and have them,</v>

4190
02:02:59.601 --> 02:02:59.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4191
02:02:59.870 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I've always talked about neuro one,</v>

4192
02:03:01.431 --> 02:03:01.881
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

4193
02:03:01.881 --> 02:03:02.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4194
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Bill Roman [inaudible] stuff.</v>

4195
02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all theirs.</v>

4196
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:06.140
<v Speaker 1>It's all fascinating stuff.</v>

4197
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And you will have an increase in</v>

4198
02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:09.253
<v Speaker 6>brain functions.</v>

4199
02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.670
<v Speaker 6>So when you're doing a state test,</v>

4200
02:03:10.671 --> 02:03:11.240
<v Speaker 6>when you're,</v>

4201
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:11.931
<v Speaker 6>when you're awake,</v>

4202
02:03:11.931 --> 02:03:12.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4203
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.960
<v Speaker 6>One of the other things you do is you look for the behavior,</v>

4204
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.330
<v Speaker 6>a strange behavior in the people that are around you.</v>

4205
02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.980
<v Speaker 6>And it's my whole life though.</v>

4206
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:20.541
<v Speaker 6>When you're a comedian,</v>

4207
02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to dream and you'll,</v>

4208
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:23.750
<v Speaker 6>you'll find,</v>

4209
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:27.260
<v Speaker 6>you'll find that initially when you first start trying to do state tests,</v>

4210
02:03:27.261 --> 02:03:28.094
<v Speaker 6>when you're awake,</v>

4211
02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:32.100
<v Speaker 6>maybe the first day it feels really awkward because now you're,</v>

4212
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:33.380
<v Speaker 6>I'm having a conversation with you,</v>

4213
02:03:33.381 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 6>but I'm also looking at the print on your shirt.</v>

4214
02:03:34.911 --> 02:03:37.880
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking down and then up and down and then up to see that it stays the same.</v>

4215
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:40.670
<v Speaker 6>But after you get used to doing that.</v>

4216
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:42.950
<v Speaker 6>And for me it only took a day,</v>

4217
02:03:42.951 --> 02:03:43.671
<v Speaker 6>day and a half,</v>

4218
02:03:43.671 --> 02:03:43.851
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4219
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 6>something like that of doing a state test maybe eight or 10 times a day.</v>

4220
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:51.980
<v Speaker 6>I found that my state tests were actually making me more aware and more mindful</v>

4221
02:03:51.981 --> 02:03:56.120
<v Speaker 6>of everything that was going on around me all the time and it,</v>

4222
02:03:56.150 --> 02:03:59.450
<v Speaker 6>and it seemed to have that effect of slowing my life down,</v>

4223
02:03:59.451 --> 02:04:01.190
<v Speaker 6>making be more considerate of,</v>

4224
02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:02.211
<v Speaker 6>of what's happening,</v>

4225
02:04:02.211 --> 02:04:04.520
<v Speaker 6>making me more present to the person that I'm with.</v>

4226
02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:05.651
<v Speaker 6>And suddenly I,</v>

4227
02:04:05.651 --> 02:04:06.620
<v Speaker 6>and I realized,</v>

4228
02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:06.880
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

4229
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.120
<v Speaker 6>like when Sam or somebody says,</v>

4230
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 6>we have no free will.</v>

4231
02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:09.591
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4232
02:04:09.591 --> 02:04:11.630
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times we are just on autopilot.</v>

4233
02:04:11.631 --> 02:04:12.620
<v Speaker 6>We're just reacting.</v>

4234
02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:14.760
<v Speaker 6>How often do you eat a meal in?</v>

4235
02:04:14.761 --> 02:04:17.450
<v Speaker 6>Don't really taste it because you were busy and you were thinking about</v>

4236
02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.680
<v Speaker 6>something else.</v>

4237
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:19.580
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4238
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.290
<v Speaker 6>when I started practicing lucid dreaming,</v>

4239
02:04:21.291 --> 02:04:21.951
<v Speaker 6>it was really,</v>

4240
02:04:21.951 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 6>it's a mindfulness practice.</v>

4241
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:23.541
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4242
02:04:23.541 --> 02:04:26.690
<v Speaker 6>it hearkens back to the Buddhist practice of mindfulness.</v>

4243
02:04:26.691 --> 02:04:29.060
<v Speaker 6>You are just more aware of what's going on all the time.</v>

4244
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:30.081
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4245
02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:30.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4246
02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>saw a movie that gave me a great technique.</v>

4247
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

4248
02:04:33.801 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was through the rabbit hole or one of those.</v>

4249
02:04:35.871 --> 02:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>What the bleep movies are just overrun with fuckery.</v>

4250
02:04:40.670 --> 02:04:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4251
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4252
02:04:41.050 --> 02:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fuckery in those movies.</v>

4253
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:43.481
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

4254
02:04:43.481 --> 02:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>even amongst fuckery you can sometimes get some,</v>

4255
02:04:46.241 --> 02:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>get something you can use and one of them is in one of the videos the guy said,</v>

4256
02:04:50.770 --> 02:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>when you come to a doorway,</v>

4257
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>knock on the door and say,</v>

4258
02:04:54.821 --> 02:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>knock on the side of the door and say,</v>

4259
02:04:55.961 --> 02:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming and do that during your waking hours?</v>

4260
02:04:59.110 --> 02:04:59.771
<v Speaker 1>Do that and go,</v>

4261
02:04:59.771 --> 02:05:00.604
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>

4262
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

4263
02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I walked up to a door and I said,</v>

4264
02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>

4265
02:05:05.831 --> 02:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And there was nothing there.</v>

4266
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.301
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

4267
02:05:07.301 --> 02:05:07.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

4268
02:05:07.901 --> 02:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking dreaming.</v>

4269
02:05:09.130 --> 02:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I went into the lucid dream,</v>

4270
02:05:10.931 --> 02:05:15.931
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing how quickly it shifted over from just this random sleep and</v>

4271
02:05:18.161 --> 02:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>dream state to just that one action of am I Jamie?</v>

4272
02:05:21.190 --> 02:05:22.001
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck,</v>

4273
02:05:22.001 --> 02:05:22.781
<v Speaker 1>I am dreaming.</v>

4274
02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the conscious mind.</v>

4275
02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Completely a rose inside of the dream.</v>

4276
02:05:27.671 --> 02:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4277
02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

4278
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It didn't maintain it for very long.</v>

4279
02:05:29.681 --> 02:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I've still never been able to maintain it for very long.</v>

4280
02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

4281
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't get laid at all.</v>

4282
02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>My dream.</v>

4283
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:35.640
<v Speaker 6>It helps to have a good policy in my dreams.</v>

4284
02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:36.190
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

4285
02:05:36.190 --> 02:05:37.590
<v Speaker 6>it helps to have a plan.</v>

4286
02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4287
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.470
<v Speaker 6>so when you're thinking about,</v>

4288
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 6>you will,</v>

4289
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:41.723
<v Speaker 6>you'll get there,</v>

4290
02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 6>you'll get there.</v>

4291
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm never felt I had been a man of faith.</v>

4292
02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 6>You will get there if anybody will let you make a jerk off too much.</v>

4293
02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

4294
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:52.140
<v Speaker 6>but if you have a plan before you go to sleep,</v>

4295
02:05:52.141 --> 02:05:53.730
<v Speaker 6>if you've mentally rehearsed,</v>

4296
02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:54.960
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4297
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:56.850
<v Speaker 6>just take 30 seconds to do it.</v>

4298
02:05:56.851 --> 02:05:57.990
<v Speaker 6>Two or three times a day.</v>

4299
02:05:58.230 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 6>If I have a lucid dream,</v>

4300
02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:00.210
<v Speaker 6>this is what I want to do.</v>

4301
02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 6>You remember like I did with my mom?</v>

4302
02:06:02.911 --> 02:06:04.650
<v Speaker 6>I remembered because at first I was like,</v>

4303
02:06:04.651 --> 02:06:04.981
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit.</v>

4304
02:06:04.981 --> 02:06:05.311
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4305
02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:06.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm in this mall and you know,</v>

4306
02:06:06.451 --> 02:06:06.601
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4307
02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:07.280
<v Speaker 6>what am I going to have?</v>

4308
02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:07.390
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4309
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:07.711
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

4310
02:06:07.711 --> 02:06:08.450
<v Speaker 6>that's right.</v>

4311
02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:09.150
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4312
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:09.660
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

4313
02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:09.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4314
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 6>tonight I had a mission.</v>

4315
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:11.910
<v Speaker 6>I want to see my mother.</v>

4316
02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:12.360
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4317
02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 6>And so if you,</v>

4318
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:14.640
<v Speaker 6>if you train for that,</v>

4319
02:06:14.890 --> 02:06:15.723
<v Speaker 6>you'll,</v>

4320
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.520
<v Speaker 6>you will be able to,</v>

4321
02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:18.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4322
02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:18.260
<v Speaker 6>what if,</v>

4323
02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.620
<v Speaker 6>do you have nefarious intentions?</v>

4324
02:06:20.190 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 6>Go for it.</v>

4325
02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:21.271
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

4326
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:21.811
<v Speaker 6>you didn't know a lot.</v>

4327
02:06:21.811 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 6>Well go for it.</v>

4328
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:24.420
<v Speaker 6>But maybe not because here's what's interesting,</v>

4329
02:06:24.421 --> 02:06:25.254
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4330
02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.730
<v Speaker 6>There's no laws,</v>

4331
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:27.091
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4332
02:06:27.091 --> 02:06:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Societal laws,</v>

4333
02:06:28.170 --> 02:06:28.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4334
02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:28.531
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

4335
02:06:28.531 --> 02:06:29.280
<v Speaker 6>in a dream,</v>

4336
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:29.730
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4337
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:31.980
<v Speaker 6>But you still have to deal with yourself in the morning.</v>

4338
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:33.600
<v Speaker 6>And I know that sounds fucking funny,</v>

4339
02:06:33.601 --> 02:06:35.760
<v Speaker 6>but like I had a chance in one of my very,</v>

4340
02:06:35.761 --> 02:06:39.060
<v Speaker 6>very early lucid dreams to bang this dream hottie it was great.</v>

4341
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:41.630
<v Speaker 6>This is the first one listed you my hat in Hawaii.</v>

4342
02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.370
<v Speaker 6>Me that you feel guilty when you woke up in the morning.</v>

4343
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even do it because here's,</v>

4344
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:46.794
<v Speaker 6>here's what happened.</v>

4345
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.240
<v Speaker 6>I ended up,</v>

4346
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:48.930
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4347
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:53.930
<v Speaker 6>so I climb up into this building and I gained lucidity and um,</v>

4348
02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.210
<v Speaker 6>there was this woman in the room and I said to her,</v>

4349
02:06:57.211 --> 02:06:58.050
<v Speaker 6>and this happens a lot of times,</v>

4350
02:06:58.051 --> 02:06:58.884
<v Speaker 6>the dream characters,</v>

4351
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.053
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4352
02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm having a lucid dream.</v>

4353
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:02.303
<v Speaker 6>I'm dreaming.</v>

4354
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 6>She's,</v>

4355
02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:02.731
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4356
02:07:02.731 --> 02:07:03.564
<v Speaker 6>you're not.</v>

4357
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:04.681
<v Speaker 6>And they won't drink.</v>

4358
02:07:04.681 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 6>Characters will invariably tell you if you say to them,</v>

4359
02:07:07.590 --> 02:07:08.460
<v Speaker 6>this is not a dream,</v>

4360
02:07:08.461 --> 02:07:09.510
<v Speaker 6>they will invariably say to you,</v>

4361
02:07:09.511 --> 02:07:10.344
<v Speaker 6>no it's not.</v>

4362
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:11.790
<v Speaker 6>And this is where the weirdest,</v>

4363
02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 6>coolest parts of of lucid dreaming.</v>

4364
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 6>Cause even Lubbers right.</v>

4365
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 6>Eminent sort of scientist just kind of shrugs his shoulders.</v>

4366
02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:21.360
<v Speaker 6>Like somehow the dream world wants to maintain its,</v>

4367
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 6>its status as,</v>

4368
02:07:23.970 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 6>as real for you.</v>

4369
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.161
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4370
02:07:26.161 --> 02:07:27.780
<v Speaker 6>So the dream characters will say,</v>

4371
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:28.920
<v Speaker 6>well this is not a dream.</v>

4372
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4373
02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:30.780
<v Speaker 6>And so I said to her,</v>

4374
02:07:30.781 --> 02:07:30.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4375
02:07:30.961 --> 02:07:31.770
<v Speaker 6>I'll prove it to you.</v>

4376
02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:32.603
<v Speaker 6>It's a dream.</v>

4377
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:33.833
<v Speaker 6>And so I,</v>

4378
02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:35.620
<v Speaker 6>I turned and it was like,</v>

4379
02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:35.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4380
02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 6>you were talking before about when you have a subjective experience,</v>

4381
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.510
<v Speaker 6>you still had the experience.</v>

4382
02:07:40.511 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4383
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 6>So I know totally what it's like to be fucking x man.</v>

4384
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:44.621
<v Speaker 6>Because I said,</v>

4385
02:07:44.621 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna prove it to you.</v>

4386
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:47.170
<v Speaker 6>And I turned and there were these big double doors,</v>

4387
02:07:47.171 --> 02:07:49.630
<v Speaker 6>like 30 feet away or something.</v>

4388
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.960
<v Speaker 6>And I just went like this with a wave of my hand and the doors.</v>

4389
02:07:52.961 --> 02:07:53.141
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4390
02:07:53.141 --> 02:07:54.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna close these stores from here.</v>

4391
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 6>I went like this with my hand and the doors slammed shut.</v>

4392
02:07:57.851 --> 02:07:58.181
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

4393
02:07:58.181 --> 02:07:59.140
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit at work.</v>

4394
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:00.003
<v Speaker 6>Cause it was like,</v>

4395
02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:00.211
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4396
02:08:00.211 --> 02:08:01.840
<v Speaker 6>what am I first lucid dreams,</v>

4397
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:02.890
<v Speaker 6>which was awesome.</v>

4398
02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:04.060
<v Speaker 6>And then I turned to her and I was like,</v>

4399
02:08:04.061 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 6>so now I'm going to have you.</v>

4400
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:05.950
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4401
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:08.670
<v Speaker 6>And so I grabbed her and I went to kiss her and then I remembered because at</v>

4402
02:08:08.671 --> 02:08:10.090
<v Speaker 6>that point I was engaged to my wife,</v>

4403
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 6>right when I was like,</v>

4404
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.501
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4405
02:08:11.501 --> 02:08:12.101

<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

4418
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 6>Maybe now even in your dreams,</v>

4419
02:08:31.091 --> 02:08:34.530
<v Speaker 6>I want you to be faithful to do that.</v>

4420
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:34.721
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>

4421
02:08:34.721 --> 02:08:35.890
<v Speaker 6>let me tell you about my wife.</v>

4422
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:38.380
<v Speaker 6>I gotta I gotta get my wife's back on this because when I told her about it</v>

4423
02:08:38.381 --> 02:08:38.591
<v Speaker 6>later,</v>

4424
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:39.130
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>

4425
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:41.670
<v Speaker 6>you could have done it immediately.</v>

4426
02:08:42.450 --> 02:08:45.100
<v Speaker 6>Just fucking take some Coleen and go right back in.</v>

4427
02:08:45.101 --> 02:08:45.341
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4428
02:08:45.341 --> 02:08:45.911
<v Speaker 6>I'll just say this,</v>

4429
02:08:45.911 --> 02:08:46.650
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing,</v>

4430
02:08:46.650 --> 02:08:46.790
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4431
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 6>other lucid dreaming since is that lots of good cover.</v>

4432
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:53.280
<v Speaker 6>But that experimental clouds,</v>

4433
02:08:53.410 --> 02:08:53.801
<v Speaker 6>wait though,</v>

4434
02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:55.930
<v Speaker 6>there's something to think about here because one of the guys in the,</v>

4435
02:08:55.931 --> 02:08:58.960
<v Speaker 6>in the workshop who attended the workshop before I brought this up,</v>

4436
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:00.303
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4437
02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:01.090
<v Speaker 6>in Hawaii,</v>

4438
02:09:01.090 --> 02:09:01.900
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

4439
02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:02.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4440
02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 6>he went to have sex with a dream character and the dream character refused him.</v>

4441
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.100
<v Speaker 6>And his first thought is,</v>

4442
02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.090
<v Speaker 6>and this is just awful,</v>

4443
02:09:10.091 --> 02:09:10.570
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

4444
02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:11.950
<v Speaker 6>was to commit dream rape.</v>

4445
02:09:12.630 --> 02:09:13.340
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4446
02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:17.140
<v Speaker 6>And so he was going to force himself on this dream character and as he started</v>

4447
02:09:17.141 --> 02:09:17.711
<v Speaker 6>to do it,</v>

4448
02:09:17.711 --> 02:09:20.590
<v Speaker 6>he realized that this is not something he wanted because again,</v>

4449
02:09:20.591 --> 02:09:20.801
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

4450
02:09:20.801 --> 02:09:24.480
<v Speaker 6>remember it feels real afterward.</v>

4451
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 6>It feels as real as anything you've ever done.</v>

4452
02:09:27.191 --> 02:09:27.311
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4453
02:09:27.311 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 6>you sound like you're having these very fragile dreams to begin with.</v>

4454
02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:30.791
<v Speaker 6>That happens.</v>

4455
02:09:30.791 --> 02:09:30.941
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4456
02:09:30.941 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it takes a while to get it built up so that,</v>

4457
02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:36.910
<v Speaker 6>so that you're lucid dreams feel at least as real,</v>

4458
02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4459
02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.073
<v Speaker 6>Is this reality?</v>

4460
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.720
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to carry it around the memory of raping somebody?</v>

4461
02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:41.440
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4462
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.960
<v Speaker 6>Did I want to carry around the memory of cheating on my wife?</v>

4463
02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:44.950
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4464
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:48.100
<v Speaker 6>Well he's got shitty dreams cause in my dream I'm a pimp.</v>

4465
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:49.420
<v Speaker 6>I just get pussy left him</v>

4466
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.180
<v Speaker 6>this tech.</v>

4467
02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.070
<v Speaker 6>My problem is I wake up right before I put it in,</v>

4468
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:55.850
<v Speaker 6>I get alone like,</v>

4469
02:09:55.851 --> 02:09:56.351
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

4470
02:09:56.351 --> 02:09:57.184
<v Speaker 6>let's do this.</v>

4471
02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:57.760
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

4472
02:09:57.760 --> 02:09:58.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm awake.</v>

4473
02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Fuck dammit.</v>

4474
02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:01.533
<v Speaker 6>That's bad news.</v>

4475
02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 6>I have shot loads in my sleep so I'm sure it's happened.</v>

4476
02:10:03.971 --> 02:10:05.050
<v Speaker 6>I just haven't been lucid.</v>

4477
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:07.060
<v Speaker 6>I never get lucid sucks.</v>

4478
02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 6>But the girls are always nice to me.</v>

4479
02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.840
<v Speaker 6>No one's every angry at me,</v>

4480
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.351
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4481
02:10:11.351 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 6>And I never have like a lucid dream pitchers like yeah,</v>

4482
02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.680

4483
02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:23.110
<v Speaker 6>Why are you so mean to me and my dream that's never happened luckily.</v>

4484
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:23.651
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

4485
02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:26.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've never wanted to do anything creepy in my dreams anyway.</v>

4486
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.730
<v Speaker 6>I've never wanted to do anything evil.</v>

4487
02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:28.210
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4488
02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:29.350
<v Speaker 6>But I have fought crime.</v>

4489
02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.130
<v Speaker 6>Really have fought dragons and shit and my dream in a lucid dream.</v>

4490
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.273
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4491
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:35.353
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4492
02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.590
<v Speaker 3>I listed dreams are really boring.</v>

4493
02:10:36.591 --> 02:10:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like getting shit done like errands and like I remember this.</v>

4494
02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:40.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4495
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:41.631
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool.</v>

4496
02:10:41.631 --> 02:10:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Like knowing I've done a few lucid dreams before.</v>

4497
02:10:44.691 --> 02:10:45.391
<v Speaker 3>It's usually when I,</v>

4498
02:10:45.391 --> 02:10:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

4499
02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>I always feel it's like the level of your sleep cause I know it seems to happen</v>

4500
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:50.180
<v Speaker 3>or you're right.</v>

4501
02:10:50.181 --> 02:10:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4502
02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:51.580
<v Speaker 6>it's definitely the level your sleep.</v>

4503
02:10:51.581 --> 02:10:52.720
<v Speaker 6>If you're fucking exhausted,</v>

4504
02:10:52.721 --> 02:10:54.340
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to really put out a good one.</v>

4505
02:10:54.341 --> 02:10:56.350
<v Speaker 6>But we should do an experiment with the show.</v>

4506
02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:58.810
<v Speaker 6>Well we should all of us try.</v>

4507
02:10:59.110 --> 02:11:00.310
<v Speaker 6>We should try to have like,</v>

4508
02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:00.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4509
02:11:00.670 --> 02:11:02.770
<v Speaker 6>have like someone who's going to come on again like Ari,</v>

4510
02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:03.671
<v Speaker 6>someone,</v>

4511
02:11:03.671 --> 02:11:05.560
<v Speaker 6>all of us tried to have a lucid dream.</v>

4512
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.500
<v Speaker 6>I just force it and then see,</v>

4513
02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.270
<v Speaker 6>see what kind of progress we could make.</v>

4514
02:11:10.330 --> 02:11:13.180
<v Speaker 6>Because you have an m but you're not like trying to how I use a dre number one,</v>

4515
02:11:13.181 --> 02:11:15.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm flattered that you already know I won't be back.</v>

4516
02:11:15.490 --> 02:11:16.000
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

4517
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.260
<v Speaker 6>I said never let them already flooded that,</v>

4518
02:11:17.261 --> 02:11:18.094
<v Speaker 6>you know I won't be back.</v>

4519
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:18.611
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4520
02:11:18.611 --> 02:11:19.450
<v Speaker 6>that's not what I meant.</v>

4521
02:11:19.451 --> 02:11:20.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean someone is here all the time.</v>

4522
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.570
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm fucking like you live in Philadelphia,</v>

4523
02:11:22.590 --> 02:11:22.870
<v Speaker 6>sir.</v>

4524
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:25.360
<v Speaker 6>You want to come back to the time you can come back to this.</v>

4525
02:11:25.690 --> 02:11:28.260
<v Speaker 6>That's not the spirit a little bit,</v>

4526
02:11:29.530 --> 02:11:30.340
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>

4527
02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:30.880

4528
02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:31.271
<v Speaker 6>honestly.</v>

4529
02:11:31.271 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 6>So you've been an Olympic dream and if chosen to just carry out errands,</v>

4530
02:11:34.690 --> 02:11:36.260
<v Speaker 6>he just gives real everywhere.</v>

4531
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:39.610
<v Speaker 6>He goes outside and she gets tackled and raped by big giant women that looked</v>

4532
02:11:39.611 --> 02:11:41.320
<v Speaker 6>like during our chrome comic books.</v>

4533
02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.380
<v Speaker 6>Big giant thighs,</v>

<v Speaker 6>giant acids.</v>

4535
02:11:45.161 --> 02:11:46.750
<v Speaker 6>They just hold them down and they just,</v>

4536
02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:50.650
<v Speaker 6>or women like this chair up in Boston and the fighter shoved his face into their</v>

4537
02:11:50.651 --> 02:11:51.820
<v Speaker 6>big meaty snatch.</v>

4540
02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.860
<v Speaker 6>big bullet wounds snatch and they just shove it in his face and then so he</v>

4541
02:11:59.861 --> 02:12:01.450
<v Speaker 6>doesn't leave the house much in his dreams.</v>

4542
02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:01.811
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4543

02:12:45.121 --> 02:12:48.540
<v Speaker 6>it's fascinating and it's even more fascinating how few people pursue it.</v>

4586
02:13:05.551 --> 02:13:06.150

<v Speaker 6>you're going to be doing public speaking or something and maybe that's not your</v>

4590
02:13:09.091 --> 02:13:09.900
<v Speaker 6>bag.</v>

02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:11.010
<v Speaker 6>You can rehearse.</v>

4592
02:13:11.190 --> 02:13:11.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4593
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:12.190
<v Speaker 6>And in,</v>

4594
02:13:12.190 --> 02:13:12.631
<v Speaker 6>in the dream.</v>

4595
02:13:12.631 --> 02:13:15.630
<v Speaker 6>So he's discovered and it's enriched my daily life.</v>

4596
02:13:15.631 --> 02:13:16.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean today I was doing,</v>

4597
02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:19.530
<v Speaker 6>I was just trying to train it again cause now I'm finally getting some sleep.</v>

4598
02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:20.730
<v Speaker 6>The boys are letting me sleep.</v>

4599
02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:21.170
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4600
02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:23.310
<v Speaker 6>And so I'm starting to state test again and stuff and,</v>

4601
02:13:23.311 --> 02:13:24.510
<v Speaker 6>and I just look,</v>

4602
02:13:24.511 --> 02:13:24.870
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4603
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:25.021
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4604
02:13:25.021 --> 02:13:27.820
<v Speaker 6>it just locks it locked me into my environment in,</v>

4605
02:13:27.821 --> 02:13:28.830
<v Speaker 6>in such a cool way.</v>

4606
02:13:28.831 --> 02:13:31.110
<v Speaker 6>I could suddenly really pick out the sound,</v>

4607
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:33.090
<v Speaker 6>the leaves blowing in the wind and the,</v>

4608
02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:33.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4609
02:13:33.590 --> 02:13:35.430
<v Speaker 6>is really interesting.</v>

4610
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

4611
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 6>it was fantastic and detail how to do that in this.</v>

4612
02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:41.280
<v Speaker 6>I do know someone can do it if they want to follow it.</v>

4613
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4614
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4615
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:43.260
<v Speaker 6>And I use the,</v>

4616
02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:46.470
<v Speaker 6>I use the rehearsing a dream scenario and I use the state tests.</v>

4617
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 6>I get both those methods.</v>

4618
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:50.130
<v Speaker 6>Don't forget the door knock folks.</v>

4619
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:51.990
<v Speaker 6>Cause that shit work for me to say,</v>

4620
02:13:51.991 --> 02:13:52.824
<v Speaker 6>am I in a dream?</v>

4621
02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:53.740
<v Speaker 6>Well that's,</v>

4622
02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:56.640
<v Speaker 6>we'll have to get that during the day or the day time.</v>

4623
02:13:56.641 --> 02:13:57.031
<v Speaker 6>Also though,</v>

4624
02:13:57.031 --> 02:13:58.440
<v Speaker 6>don't you just do that during the day?</v>

4625
02:13:58.470 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 6>That would be so hilarious to see you walking around fucking knocking on doors</v>

4626
02:14:01.471 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 6>and every time you do it you go,</v>

4627
02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:03.813
<v Speaker 6>am I dreaming?</v>

4628
02:14:04.050 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4629
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:05.393
<v Speaker 6>then I'll do it.</v>

4630
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:06.030
<v Speaker 6>I'll do it.</v>

4631
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:08.550
<v Speaker 6>I just go [inaudible] then I'm dreaming.</v>

4632
02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:09.800
<v Speaker 6>There's no reason why heard it.</v>

4633
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:10.200
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>

4634
02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.220
<v Speaker 6>That's a good one as well.</v>

4635
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 6>Then also in trade pop up or Chinese people,</v>

4636
02:14:13.591 --> 02:14:13.800
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4637
02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:14.700
<v Speaker 6>Then you say Asians,</v>

4638
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:15.720
<v Speaker 6>if you're in your dreams,</v>

4639
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:17.310
<v Speaker 6>there's actually been really good research that,</v>

4640
02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.030
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4641
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:21.360
<v Speaker 6>what we dreamed tends to be stuff we've been thinking about a lot in the last 24</v>

4642
02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 6>to 48 hours.</v>

4643
02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.900
<v Speaker 6>So the whole principle of state testing and asking that question,</v>

4644
02:14:24.901 --> 02:14:25.770
<v Speaker 6>is this a dream?</v>

4645
02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:26.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4646
02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:26.850
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4647
02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:28.020
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

4648
02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.030
<v Speaker 6>the way I always present my awake or am I dreaming?</v>

4649
02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:31.200
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4650
02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.390
<v Speaker 6>the whole point of that is that when you do that regularly,</v>

4651
02:14:33.391 --> 02:14:37.140
<v Speaker 6>you're more likely to have that thought that arise while you are fucking</v>

4652
02:14:37.141 --> 02:14:37.690
<v Speaker 6>dreaming,</v>

4653
02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:38.320
<v Speaker 6>when you're really doing.</v>

4654
02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:38.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4655
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 6>And it works.</v>

4656
02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:41.281
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4657
02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 6>That was the idea of the habit of knocking on the door that you'll,</v>

4658
02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.890
<v Speaker 6>they'll transfer that habit to your dreams.</v>

4659
02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.220
<v Speaker 6>The idea of dreams are so fucking fascinating.</v>

4660
02:14:50.221 --> 02:14:53.430
<v Speaker 6>There's so little we know about what the fuck is really happening and what kind</v>

4661
02:14:53.431 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 6>of weird imaginary world you're creating inside your mind.</v>

4662
02:14:56.401 --> 02:14:58.260
<v Speaker 6>And I love when people try to say,</v>

4663
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.621
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4664
02:14:58.621 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 6>this means that you know,</v>

4665
02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:01.760
<v Speaker 6>the dragon represents,</v>

4666
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:02.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4667
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:03.630
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what the fuck is talk,</v>

4668
02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 6>I am in the Lord of the rings and I'm fighting a dragon.</v>

4669
02:15:06.481 --> 02:15:07.670
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't represent shit.</v>

4670
02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4671
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.701
<v Speaker 6>it represents,</v>

4672
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:10.380
<v Speaker 6>I like watching wacky movies,</v>

4673
02:15:10.381 --> 02:15:10.800
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4674
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:12.660
<v Speaker 6>So I got high and watched game of Thrones,</v>

4675
02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 6>took five Alpha brains,</v>

4676
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:16.530
<v Speaker 6>went to sleep and had a fucking dragon war.</v>

4677
02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:19.200
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes the cigar really is just fucking scar.</v>

4678
02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.080
<v Speaker 6>There are definitely times when you can say to yourself,</v>

4679
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.920
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4680
02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:24.600
<v Speaker 6>why this content,</v>

4681
02:15:24.601 --> 02:15:24.840
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4682
02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:25.890
<v Speaker 6>Why these images,</v>

4683
02:15:25.891 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 6>why these sounds?</v>

4684
02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:27.511
<v Speaker 6>Is there,</v>

4685
02:15:27.511 --> 02:15:28.890
<v Speaker 6>is there some message for me here,</v>

4686
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:29.250
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

4687
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:33.630
<v Speaker 6>something my subconscious is and knowing on that I should be aware of and work</v>

4688
02:15:33.631 --> 02:15:34.464
<v Speaker 6>with in some way?</v>

4689
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:34.711
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4690
02:15:34.711 --> 02:15:39.711
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's a lot of things that occur in a dream or things that you're</v>

4691
02:15:40.441 --> 02:15:45.200
<v Speaker 6>fixated on and things that are constantly in your mind and that your imagination</v>

4692
02:15:45.201 --> 02:15:48.670
<v Speaker 6>will turn them into a dragon or a witch or a demon or,</v>

4693
02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:49.410
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

4694
02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 6>a vampire,</v>

4695
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:51.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4696
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 6>or a disease.</v>

4697
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:53.540
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4698
02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:53.830
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

4699
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:55.740
<v Speaker 6>there's all sorts of things that you're terrified of.</v>

4700
02:15:55.741 --> 02:15:59.220
<v Speaker 6>And real life that you fixate on and much like the knocking on the door,</v>

4701
02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 6>they just follow you and your dreams.</v>

4702
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:02.103
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4703
02:16:02.190 --> 02:16:04.260
<v Speaker 6>And this gives you a chance to deal with them.</v>

4704
02:16:04.261 --> 02:16:04.441
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4705
02:16:04.441 --> 02:16:06.930
<v Speaker 6>if you approach something that's in a nightmare,</v>

4706
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.560
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4707
02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.210
<v Speaker 6>more like a friend,</v>

4708
02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:10.260
<v Speaker 6>and that's weird to say,</v>

4709
02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:10.850
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4710
02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:11.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4711
02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:12.420
<v Speaker 6>Lubbers did this with a,</v>

4712
02:16:12.421 --> 02:16:15.210
<v Speaker 6>this really ugly ogre that showed up on one of his dreams,</v>

4713
02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4714
02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:17.940
<v Speaker 6>that he would always recoil from.</v>

4715
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:18.870
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4716
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:20.730
<v Speaker 6>he decided to,</v>

4717
02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:21.630
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4718
02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:22.231
<v Speaker 6>we'll confront,</v>

4719
02:16:22.231 --> 02:16:23.910
<v Speaker 6>it's the wrong word because it sounds adversarial,</v>

4720
02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:28.140
<v Speaker 6>but he decided to approach it in a spirit of curiosity and compassion and like</v>

4721
02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 6>figure out what's going on with it.</v>

4722
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:32.170
<v Speaker 6>And I can't remember what exactly he said to it,</v>

4723
02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:33.340
<v Speaker 6>but he ended up,</v>

4724
02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 6>he accepted it,</v>

4725
02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:34.720
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4726
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:34.951
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

4727
02:16:34.951 --> 02:16:35.230
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4728
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:37.930
<v Speaker 6>he didn't recoil from it and it actually,</v>

4729
02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:38.853
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4730
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:39.611
<v Speaker 6>if I remember correctly,</v>

4731
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:40.750
<v Speaker 6>it became a part of him,</v>

4732
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:41.650
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4733
02:16:41.650 --> 02:16:43.610
<v Speaker 6>He became a part of it.</v>

4734
02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:45.850
<v Speaker 6>Just kind of blended into him and he any,</v>

4735
02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:47.470
<v Speaker 6>any took that as a sign of,</v>

4736
02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:48.573
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

4737
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

4738
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:49.790
<v Speaker 6>Mr Comedian,</v>

4739
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 6>take this on for size.</v>

4740
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:51.400
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4741
02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:52.600
<v Speaker 6>Dreams are about integration.</v>

4742
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:57.400
<v Speaker 6>There are things we deny about ourselves and about our experience and they come</v>

4743
02:16:57.401 --> 02:17:00.580
<v Speaker 6>up in your dream because this is something you need to deal with and need to</v>

4744
02:17:00.581 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 6>look at.</v>

4745
02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.910
<v Speaker 6>And so if you do accept it in that way,</v>

4746
02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:08.020
<v Speaker 6>you end up feeling more empowered because instead of rejecting this thing,</v>

4747
02:17:08.470 --> 02:17:09.303
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

4748
02:17:09.310 --> 02:17:10.600
<v Speaker 6>you're willing separately.</v>

4749
02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:12.280
<v Speaker 6>While I always thought that was fascinating,</v>

4750
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 6>when people give the very good advice of sleep on it,</v>

4751
02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:17.170
<v Speaker 6>you know something's bothering you,</v>

4752
02:17:17.171 --> 02:17:18.004
<v Speaker 6>sleep on it.</v>

4753
02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 6>He goes that that there is something that happens to you during the dream state</v>

4754
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:25.000
<v Speaker 6>where you have a better perspective in the morning.</v>

4755
02:17:25.001 --> 02:17:25.900
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is,</v>

4756
02:17:25.901 --> 02:17:28.750
<v Speaker 6>but I am a big proponent and sleeping on it.</v>

4757
02:17:28.751 --> 02:17:31.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm also a big proponent and jerking off before you make any decisions.</v>

4758
02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:34.240
<v Speaker 6>That's also very important.</v>

4759
02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:34.991
<v Speaker 6>I have to tell you,</v>

4760
02:17:34.991 --> 02:17:35.350
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4761
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:38.830
<v Speaker 6>I hadn't experienced writing the book with a lucid dream where you can't imagine</v>

4762
02:17:38.831 --> 02:17:40.390
<v Speaker 6>the anxiety I had before writing it.</v>

4763
02:17:40.390 --> 02:17:41.350
<v Speaker 6>It was my first book.</v>

4764
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4765
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 6>I'd been writing for years and years and years,</v>

4766
02:17:43.751 --> 02:17:44.051
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

4767
02:17:44.051 --> 02:17:44.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4768
02:17:44.231 --> 02:17:45.460
<v Speaker 6>5,000 word stories,</v>

4769
02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:46.960
<v Speaker 6>maybe a 7,000 word story.</v>

4770
02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:51.670
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm going to have to write fucking legit book in hardcover form.</v>

4771
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.700
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4772
02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to have to write 90,000 words in 10 weeks.</v>

4773
02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:59.560
<v Speaker 6>And it was right before I was supposed to go get married.</v>

4774
02:17:59.561 --> 02:18:02.890
<v Speaker 6>And so there was no fucking with that deadline,</v>

4775
02:18:02.891 --> 02:18:03.071
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4776
02:18:03.071 --> 02:18:07.600
<v Speaker 6>I was going to have to write this thing and have a full good working draft of it</v>

4777
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:08.950
<v Speaker 6>done in a 10 week period.</v>

4778
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.020
<v Speaker 6>And I was having all sorts of anxiety over it.</v>

4779
02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.340
<v Speaker 6>And I ended up,</v>

4780
02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:12.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4781
02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:17.450
<v Speaker 6>approaching a dream character in a store and I said to them,</v>

4782
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:18.750
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4783
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 6>I need help.</v>

4784
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:19.991
<v Speaker 6>And she's like,</v>

4785
02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:20.651
<v Speaker 6>we need help with.</v>

4786
02:18:20.651 --> 02:18:20.981
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

4787
02:18:20.981 --> 02:18:21.814
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4788
02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm writing a book.</v>

4789
02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:27.790
<v Speaker 6>And she said to me with the utmost sort of compassion and sincerity,</v>

4790
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.983
<v Speaker 6>she said,</v>

4791
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:30.130
<v Speaker 6>the book is already written.</v>

4792
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:36.360
<v Speaker 6>And I had from that the feeling of,</v>

4793
02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:37.151
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4794
02:18:37.151 --> 02:18:37.601
<v Speaker 6>there's just not,</v>

4795
02:18:37.601 --> 02:18:37.751
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4796
02:18:37.751 --> 02:18:38.170
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4797
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:40.000
<v Speaker 6>you've worked on creative projects at the time.</v>

4798
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:43.210
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing like having finished and knowing it's right and it's good.</v>

4799
02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:47.450
<v Speaker 6>And I had that feeling just sort of flood into me when,</v>

4800
02:18:47.451 --> 02:18:52.030
<v Speaker 6>when she said this so real and so vividly that when I woke up I started thinking</v>

4801
02:18:52.031 --> 02:18:54.400
<v Speaker 6>about all the vagaries of how time works and all this sort of stuff.</v>

4802
02:18:54.401 --> 02:18:55.040
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>

4803
02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:56.620
<v Speaker 6>in a sense the book is already written.</v>

4804
02:18:56.621 --> 02:19:00.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to live through the period of writing it and it just totally</v>

4805
02:19:00.431 --> 02:19:02.410
<v Speaker 6>reframe the experience of writing that book for me.</v>

4806
02:19:02.411 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 6>And in a strange sort of way,</v>

4807
02:19:03.821 --> 02:19:06.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean to say that I wrote the book and an altered states,</v>

4808
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:09.160
<v Speaker 6>it is a big powerful statement in a way.</v>

4809
02:19:09.161 --> 02:19:09.850
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

4810
02:19:09.850 --> 02:19:13.000
<v Speaker 6>I never had less anxiety about writing anything in my life.</v>

4811
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.450
<v Speaker 6>I would wake up seven seven 30 in the morning and was completely on lean from</v>

4812
02:19:16.451 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>

4813
02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 6>I would get a cup of coffee,</v>

4814
02:19:18.521 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 6>I'd be writing within 15 minutes of waking up instead of producing what my goal</v>

4815
02:19:22.541 --> 02:19:22.781
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

4816
02:19:22.781 --> 02:19:24.550
<v Speaker 6>which is around 1500 words a day.</v>

4817
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:29.790
<v Speaker 6>I was regularly writing 300050008000 there were days I wrote over 10,000 words</v>

4818
02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:35.390
<v Speaker 6>in one day I would finish at two 30 or three I would eclipse my fucking goal by</v>

4819
02:19:35.391 --> 02:19:36.051
<v Speaker 6>miles.</v>

4820
02:19:36.051 --> 02:19:39.350
<v Speaker 6>I would finish at two 30 or three I would go out and buy fresh groceries and a</v>

4821
02:19:39.351 --> 02:19:41.660
<v Speaker 6>bottle of wine and when my wife would get home,</v>

4822
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:46.690
<v Speaker 6>I'd beat as joyful friar standing there making her this like a delicious dinner</v>

4823
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:49.370
<v Speaker 6>and totally enjoying my life.</v>

4824
02:19:49.371 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 6>Like rocking balls.</v>

4825
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:50.631
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4826
02:19:50.631 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

4827
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.980
<v Speaker 6>it was awesome.</v>

4828
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4829
02:19:53.530 --> 02:19:56.690
<v Speaker 6>and it was lucid dreaming that did that and it was that experience of having</v>

4830
02:19:56.691 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 6>that anxiety taken away from me in this really vivid,</v>

4831
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 6>a real way.</v>

4832
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.070
<v Speaker 6>Having those really fascinating.</v>

4833
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.970
<v Speaker 6>It was awesome.</v>

4834
02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if we could get people are in on this one.</v>

4835
02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:13.100
<v Speaker 6>If we get people to just start trying to lucid dream there is the resources</v>

4836
02:20:14.631 --> 02:20:15.141
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>

4837
02:20:15.141 --> 02:20:15.974
<v Speaker 6>Besides your book,</v>

4838
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:18.260
<v Speaker 6>would you recommend people checking out?</v>

4839
02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.080
<v Speaker 6>You can go to Steven [inaudible] website.</v>

4840
02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:21.080
<v Speaker 6>Do you say his name?</v>

4841
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:22.700
<v Speaker 6>Laberge a l a,</v>

4845
02:20:24.350 --> 02:20:24.860

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.090
<v Speaker 6>And he has a website.</v>

4847
02:20:26.091 --> 02:20:26.970
<v Speaker 6>Steven laberge.</v>

4848
02:20:26.971 --> 02:20:27.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4849
02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:27.681
<v Speaker 6>just search.</v>

4850
02:20:27.681 --> 02:20:29.680
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember what the addresses for it.</v>

4851
02:20:29.970 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4852
02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.370
<v Speaker 6>his book is,</v>

4853
02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:33.080
<v Speaker 6>is really phenomenal.</v>

4854
02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:34.863
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4855
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:36.500
<v Speaker 6>it's very scientific,</v>

4856
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:38.600
<v Speaker 6>but it's for the,</v>

4857
02:20:38.650 --> 02:20:38.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4858
02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:40.310
<v Speaker 6>anybody can read it and pick it up.</v>

4859
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:41.203
<v Speaker 6>So I mean there</v>

4860
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:48.010
<v Speaker 6>it's become the Bible for what they call themselves on iron odds for people who</v>

4861
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:49.850
<v Speaker 6>lucid dream regularly.</v>

4862
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.360
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4863
02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:52.100
<v Speaker 6>I want to say some about my book by the way.</v>

4864
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:54.050
<v Speaker 6>It is right now.</v>

4865
02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:54.280
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

4866
02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:54.860
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4867
02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4868
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:56.210
<v Speaker 6>it's back listed,</v>

4869
02:20:56.211 --> 02:20:57.060
<v Speaker 6>which means they're no longer,</v>

4870
02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.400
<v Speaker 6>they're not completely ignoring it,</v>

4871
02:20:58.401 --> 02:20:59.570
<v Speaker 6>but it's been out for a couple of years.</v>

4872
02:20:59.570 --> 02:21:00.650
<v Speaker 6>So they're not pushing it.</v>

4873
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:02.300
<v Speaker 6>And once they,</v>

4874
02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.700
<v Speaker 6>one of the things they do with a blacklisted book is they'll price it down to a</v>

4875
02:21:04.701 --> 02:21:09.701
<v Speaker 6>dollar 99 on kindle for a couple of weeks and jack up the sales figures.</v>

4876
02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:11.330
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4877
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 6>And so I asked them in advance of the show,</v>

4878
02:21:13.071 --> 02:21:13.940
<v Speaker 6>could you please leave it?</v>

4879
02:21:13.941 --> 02:21:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Cause they just did it recently.</v>

4880
02:21:14.901 --> 02:21:15.171
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4881
02:21:15.171 --> 02:21:17.870
<v Speaker 6>please leave it at a dollar 99 for the show.</v>

4882
02:21:17.871 --> 02:21:18.704
<v Speaker 6>And they said,</v>

4883
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:19.783
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4884
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:21.740
<v Speaker 6>But I woke up this morning and Brian,</v>

4885
02:21:21.741 --> 02:21:22.610
<v Speaker 6>I guess has got up now.</v>

4886
02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.050
<v Speaker 6>It's still a dollar 99,</v>

4887
02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:24.800
<v Speaker 6>please.</v>

4888
02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't get fucked up.</v>

4889
02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:26.930
<v Speaker 6>What's it supposed to?</v>

4890
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 6>They fucked up but good because,</v>

4891
02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:29.000
<v Speaker 6>eh,</v>

4892
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4893
02:21:29.390 --> 02:21:29.781
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4894
02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.160
<v Speaker 6>it's nine 99 normally,</v>

4895
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:33.860
<v Speaker 6>but my feeling is let's just get it into people's hands.</v>

4896
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:36.950
<v Speaker 6>And so right now let's all engage in an act of piracy.</v>

4897
02:21:36.951 --> 02:21:38.120
<v Speaker 6>Harper Collins fucked up.</v>

4898
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:40.490
<v Speaker 6>Get out there and get the book for a buck 99.</v>

4899
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:41.121
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>

4900
02:21:41.121 --> 02:21:42.110
<v Speaker 6>And I hope they look,</v>

4901
02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.160
<v Speaker 6>I hope they change their minds.</v>

4902
02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:46.380
<v Speaker 6>It's possible that the person I talked to ended up running up the flagpole and</v>

4903
02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:46.641
<v Speaker 6>decided,</v>

4904
02:21:46.641 --> 02:21:46.971
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

4905
02:21:46.971 --> 02:21:47.990
<v Speaker 6>we should leave it at this price.</v>

4906
02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:48.890
<v Speaker 6>I don't really know,</v>

4907
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.140
<v Speaker 6>but I know what they told me it was an unequivocal no,</v>

4908
02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:53.060
<v Speaker 6>but here it is still a dollar 99,</v>

4909
02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:53.931
<v Speaker 6>but he's found it.</v>

4910
02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:55.280
<v Speaker 6>I'll get it for 11 bucks.</v>

4911
02:21:55.430 --> 02:21:56.263
<v Speaker 6>That's a hardcover.</v>

4912
02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:56.511
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4913
02:21:56.511 --> 02:21:57.240
<v Speaker 6>the hardcover.</v>

4914
02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:57.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4915
02:21:57.570 --> 02:21:58.403
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4916
02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.330
<v Speaker 6>Well that's great man.</v>

4917
02:21:59.331 --> 02:22:01.340
<v Speaker 6>Don I know is very reasonable and I,</v>

4918
02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:02.660
<v Speaker 6>I get all my books through.</v>

4919
02:22:02.661 --> 02:22:03.190
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4920
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.470
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4921
02:22:03.470 --> 02:22:04.071
<v Speaker 6>I have one of those,</v>

4922
02:22:04.071 --> 02:22:05.630
<v Speaker 6>I have a kindle and I have a,</v>

4923
02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4924
02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:07.490
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>

4925
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:10.040
<v Speaker 6>The book to Barnes and noble version of it.</v>

4926
02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:10.671
<v Speaker 6>Any book,</v>

4927
02:22:10.671 --> 02:22:11.510
<v Speaker 6>any magazine,</v>

4928
02:22:11.511 --> 02:22:13.270
<v Speaker 6>I suddenly feel the impulse to,</v>

4929
02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:13.791
<v Speaker 6>to read.</v>

4930
02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:14.271
<v Speaker 6>It's there.</v>

4931
02:22:14.271 --> 02:22:15.180
<v Speaker 6>And when my tablet,</v>

4932
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:15.720
<v Speaker 6>instantly,</v>

4933
02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:16.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4934
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:17.870
<v Speaker 6>we live in strange times,</v>

4935
02:22:17.871 --> 02:22:18.170
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4936
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:19.400
<v Speaker 6>The ability to get those,</v>

4937
02:22:19.850 --> 02:22:23.390
<v Speaker 6>you get a book like that off of Wifi and some of them even have three g</v>

4938
02:22:23.391 --> 02:22:24.051
<v Speaker 6>connections.</v>

4939
02:22:24.051 --> 02:22:27.240
<v Speaker 6>It's like walkie fucking times for publishing.</v>

4940
02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:27.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4941
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.381
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4942
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:28.591
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4943
02:22:28.591 --> 02:22:29.101
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

4944
02:22:29.101 --> 02:22:29.421
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4945
02:22:29.421 --> 02:22:31.290
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people are getting their books that way now.</v>

4946
02:22:31.291 --> 02:22:31.591
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4947
02:22:31.591 --> 02:22:32.131
<v Speaker 6>What is your,</v>

4948
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 6>do you know what the percentage of Ebook to regular buckets,</v>

4949
02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.090
<v Speaker 6>what you're selling?</v>

4950
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:38.850
<v Speaker 6>I know this book is outselling,</v>

4951
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:39.540
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4952
02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:40.860
<v Speaker 6>from the time it was released,</v>

4953
02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 6>it's way more electronic and more than the general industry.</v>

4954
02:22:45.931 --> 02:22:48.300
<v Speaker 6>So when this first came out in a year and a half,</v>

4955
02:22:48.301 --> 02:22:49.470
<v Speaker 6>two years ago or whatever it is,</v>

4956
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:50.221
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

4957
02:22:50.221 --> 02:22:52.640
<v Speaker 6>I think they told me the figure was like 50 low,</v>

4958
02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 6>50% higher for electronic books.</v>

4959
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.290
<v Speaker 6>This book was over 60% electronic books.</v>

4960
02:22:58.291 --> 02:22:59.380
<v Speaker 6>And I'm answering what that says,</v>

4961
02:22:59.400 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4962
02:22:59.640 --> 02:22:59.941
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4963
02:22:59.941 --> 02:23:00.361
<v Speaker 6>it's the,</v>

4964
02:23:00.361 --> 02:23:03.240
<v Speaker 6>the friends subjects are really supported by the Internet,</v>

4965
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:06.420
<v Speaker 6>Internet websites and all the nuttiness.</v>

4966
02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:07.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4967
02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:09.000
<v Speaker 6>w there's a bent spoon on the cover.</v>

4968
02:23:09.390 --> 02:23:11.040
<v Speaker 6>Can people bend spoons with their brain.</v>

4969
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:11.581
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4970
02:23:11.581 --> 02:23:14.580
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to get to the bottom of that and it's an immersion journalist.</v>

4971
02:23:14.581 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 6>I actually was waking up in the morning and trying to bend a fucking spoon,</v>

4972
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.971
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4973
02:23:18.971 --> 02:23:19.920
<v Speaker 6>Really with my head.</v>

4974
02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:22.860
<v Speaker 6>And I did it I think three days in a row where,</v>

4975
02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4976
02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:26.220
<v Speaker 6>I think the first thing I wanted to go 15 minutes and I just started feeling so</v>

4977
02:23:26.221 --> 02:23:27.810
<v Speaker 6>silly after seven or eight that I stopped.</v>

4978
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:29.250
<v Speaker 6>And then on day two,</v>

4979
02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:29.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4980
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:32.600
<v Speaker 6>I think I did three or four minutes on day three of like staring at the spirit</v>

4981
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:34.620
<v Speaker 6>for like 45 seconds.</v>

4982
02:23:34.621 --> 02:23:34.981
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

4983
02:23:34.981 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 6>I can't do this.</v>

4984
02:23:36.570 --> 02:23:37.350
<v Speaker 6>I cannot do this.</v>

4985
02:23:37.350 --> 02:23:41.610
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if you like one of those monks on a mountain dude to stare at that spoon</v>

4986
02:23:41.611 --> 02:23:44.340
<v Speaker 6>for days and days and days it goes like this.</v>

4987
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:45.630
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

4988
02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:47.220
<v Speaker 6>Just imperceptibly,</v>

4989
02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:50.640
<v Speaker 6>I've had some people that respect tell me they think it's real and that I</v>

4990
02:23:50.641 --> 02:23:52.890
<v Speaker 6>couldn't do it because I couldn't do it because I wasn't taking it.</v>

4991
02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:55.440
<v Speaker 6>People leaving it hot water,</v>

4992
02:23:55.441 --> 02:23:57.420
<v Speaker 6>you respect them because they can kick your ass.</v>

4993
02:23:58.290 --> 02:23:59.700
<v Speaker 6>That's one reason to respect somebody.</v>

4994
02:23:59.701 --> 02:24:01.440
<v Speaker 6>That's where the intersection of a lot of money,</v>

4995
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:04.200
<v Speaker 6>the met along the way,</v>

4996
02:24:04.201 --> 02:24:06.090
<v Speaker 6>who haven't stuck their neck out on this publicly,</v>

4997
02:24:06.470 --> 02:24:06.840
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4998
02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:07.661
<v Speaker 6>because it's,</v>

4999
02:24:07.661 --> 02:24:08.401
<v Speaker 6>it's really fraught,</v>

5000
02:24:08.401 --> 02:24:08.551
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5001
02:24:08.551 --> 02:24:08.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5002
02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:11.580
<v Speaker 6>the guy who popularized it or he'd Geller is,</v>

5003
02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:12.240
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5004
02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:12.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5005
02:24:12.481 --> 02:24:15.120
<v Speaker 6>in my first amendment protected opinion because he's fairly to just,</v>

5006
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:15.800
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5007
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:16.633
<v Speaker 6>a magician.</v>

5008
02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:18.373
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

5009
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:20.730
<v Speaker 6>and so it's a very controversial subject.</v>

5010
02:24:20.731 --> 02:24:22.140
<v Speaker 6>This is one of the places that James,</v>

5011
02:24:22.141 --> 02:24:23.340
<v Speaker 6>Randy kind of made his bones.</v>

5012
02:24:23.341 --> 02:24:28.341
<v Speaker 6>The skeptic in a debunker was going after rate Gellar and so a lot of people</v>

5013
02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:32.190
<v Speaker 6>just don't want to be publicly linked to this subject,</v>

5014
02:24:32.191 --> 02:24:33.090
<v Speaker 6>even if they believe in it.</v>

5015
02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:37.530
<v Speaker 6>And so I met some people like that who have never publicly spoken about it.</v>

5016
02:24:37.970 --> 02:24:38.520
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5017
02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:39.211
<v Speaker 6>but they're,</v>

5018
02:24:39.211 --> 02:24:39.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5019
02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:42.300
<v Speaker 6>they're doing incredible stuff in the world and they,</v>

5020
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:43.493
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5021
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.530
<v Speaker 6>they claim that they were able to do it or they,</v>

5022
02:24:46.531 --> 02:24:46.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5023
02:24:46.771 --> 02:24:47.491
<v Speaker 6>they were at a quote,</v>

5024
02:24:47.491 --> 02:24:48.510
<v Speaker 6>spoon bending party.</v>

5025
02:24:48.511 --> 02:24:50.280
<v Speaker 6>There's some people that the been throwing parties,</v>

5026
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.821
<v Speaker 6>grab it here.</v>

5027
02:24:50.821 --> 02:24:52.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna have my spoon right up your ass.</v>

5028
02:24:52.771 --> 02:24:54.330
<v Speaker 6>Ain't no spoon bending party.</v>

5029
02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:57.030
<v Speaker 6>You know what [inaudible] Gardy,</v>

5030
02:24:57.190 --> 02:25:02.190
<v Speaker 6>I got to say all those guys would pass on on the million dollar prize that he's</v>

5031
02:25:02.611 --> 02:25:03.444
<v Speaker 6>offering.</v>

5032
02:25:03.570 --> 02:25:04.403
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5033
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.110
<v Speaker 6>the million dollar prize is Randy's million dollar prize.</v>

5034
02:25:07.111 --> 02:25:07.944
<v Speaker 6>The bullshit.</v>

5035
02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:09.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm not into it.</v>

5036
02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:09.601
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5037
02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:09.671
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5038
02:25:09.671 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 6>I think that they did not end up in his since idea prize.</v>

5039
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:18.120
<v Speaker 6>The people who are doing incredible Perez psychology don't fit in to the way the</v>

5040
02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:18.954
<v Speaker 6>prize works.</v>

5041
02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 6>So like people like Dean Raden and Rupert Sheldrake and when Sam was on here,</v>

5042
02:25:22.891 --> 02:25:26.590
<v Speaker 6>he about Rupert and said there's something very fishy about not going after the</v>

5043
02:25:26.591 --> 02:25:27.220
<v Speaker 6>million.</v>

5044
02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:27.490
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5045
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:29.050
<v Speaker 6>There's really not because,</v>

5046
02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:29.241
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5047
02:25:29.241 --> 02:25:29.471
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5048
02:25:29.471 --> 02:25:29.681
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5049
02:25:29.681 --> 02:25:30.431
<v Speaker 6>and I love Sam,</v>

5050
02:25:30.431 --> 02:25:32.260
<v Speaker 6>but I just think that maybe he,</v>

5051
02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:32.831
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

5052
02:25:32.831 --> 02:25:35.680
<v Speaker 6>we all come at this with a worldview and he's probably a little more predisposed</v>

5053
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:37.510
<v Speaker 6>to be on the material side of things.</v>

5054
02:25:37.511 --> 02:25:37.900
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5055
02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5056
02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:38.501
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5057
02:25:38.501 --> 02:25:39.220
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5058
02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:39.700
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

5059
02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:40.533
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

5060
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:44.770
<v Speaker 6>Sheldrake or or Dean Raden or any of these guys,</v>

5061
02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 6>Daryl Bem,</v>

5062
02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:47.680
<v Speaker 6>they're going to construct a study that requires dozens,</v>

5063
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:52.710
<v Speaker 6>if not a hundred subjects that will take an hour and a half for their each</v>

5064
02:25:53.201 --> 02:25:56.170
<v Speaker 6>individual session conducted over weeks,</v>

5065
02:25:56.170 --> 02:25:56.200
<v Speaker 6>months,</v>

5066
02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:01.200
<v Speaker 6>or a year to get like this Ganzfeld effect at 32% versus 25% right.</v>

5067
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:04.280
<v Speaker 6>That we started this whole thing with and James Randy is going to need,</v>

5068
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 6>needs an event that will take place with a very small sample size where you'll</v>

5069
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:09.070
<v Speaker 6>get like 10 bites at the apple,</v>

5070
02:26:09.071 --> 02:26:13.330
<v Speaker 6>basically 10 chances to get something or 12 in an afternoon or an evening.</v>

5071
02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:16.510
<v Speaker 6>It is apples to oranges.</v>

5072
02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:21.540
<v Speaker 6>It is completely in a clickable to what credible Paris psychologists are doing.</v>

5073
02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:26.641
<v Speaker 6>So the idea that Rupert Sheldrake hasn't taken it up is not only not very fishy,</v>

5074
02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:28.600
<v Speaker 6>it tells you that he has some,</v>

5075
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:29.740
<v Speaker 6>some fucking sense.</v>

5076
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:33.400
<v Speaker 6>So in order to get Randy's money,</v>

5077
02:26:33.401 --> 02:26:36.940
<v Speaker 6>you have to do something like make the empire state building disappear.</v>

5078
02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:37.923
<v Speaker 6>You can do something.</v>

5079
02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:39.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5080
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:40.450
<v Speaker 6>And you have to do it in a small,</v>

5081
02:26:40.451 --> 02:26:42.550
<v Speaker 6>the big thing is you have to do it in a small sample size.</v>

5082
02:26:42.551 --> 02:26:42.940
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5083
02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:45.970
<v Speaker 6>statistical segment significance is generated by sheer repetition,</v>

5084
02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:47.021
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5085
02:26:47.021 --> 02:26:48.190
<v Speaker 6>And so when you're in a rand,</v>

5086
02:26:48.191 --> 02:26:51.520
<v Speaker 6>Randy requires a small sample size to approve.</v>

5087
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:54.040
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't specifically require a small sample size,</v>

5088
02:26:54.041 --> 02:26:55.900
<v Speaker 6>but whenever you look at any of the studies they're doing,</v>

5089
02:26:55.901 --> 02:26:56.350
<v Speaker 6>they're doing,</v>

5090
02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:57.670
<v Speaker 6>they're doing stuff that takes,</v>

5091
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.540
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

5092
02:26:58.540 --> 02:26:58.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5093
02:26:58.721 --> 02:27:00.490
<v Speaker 6>an afternoon or an evening.</v>

5094
02:27:00.491 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 6>And it's a kind of a public event.</v>

5095
02:27:02.470 --> 02:27:02.801
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

5096
02:27:02.801 --> 02:27:03.191
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

5097
02:27:03.191 --> 02:27:03.551
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

5098
02:27:03.551 --> 02:27:05.170
<v Speaker 6>I mean there are some pair of psychologists,</v>

5099
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:06.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5100
02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:08.590
<v Speaker 6>think his name's Dick Biermann who said he approached him and couldn't work.</v>

5101
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:09.423
<v Speaker 6>Anything else,</v>

5102
02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:10.410
<v Speaker 6>super grateful,</v>

5103
02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:10.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5104
02:27:10.890 --> 02:27:12.370
<v Speaker 6>approached me and couldn't work anything out.</v>

5105
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:15.300
<v Speaker 6>Daryl bem apparently thought about it and,</v>

5106
02:27:15.301 --> 02:27:16.500
<v Speaker 6>and realize that with the,</v>

5107
02:27:16.501 --> 02:27:17.470
<v Speaker 6>within these parameters,</v>

5108
02:27:17.471 --> 02:27:19.060
<v Speaker 6>the kind of research he's doing,</v>

5109
02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:23.320
<v Speaker 6>the kind of effect size he's trying to take to get the time it would take him to</v>

5110
02:27:23.321 --> 02:27:27.640
<v Speaker 6>generate that just doesn't really fit into what they're doing over there.</v>

5111
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:30.610
<v Speaker 6>What seems to me that that statistical 32% is,</v>

5112
02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.780
<v Speaker 6>that's a real number.</v>

5113
02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:34.810
<v Speaker 6>It's 7% difference is legit.</v>

5114
02:27:35.350 --> 02:27:38.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean it would seems like that's something that has to kind of be looked at</v>

5115
02:27:38.381 --> 02:27:38.950
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

5116
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:39.910
<v Speaker 6>It should be,</v>

5117
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:41.170
<v Speaker 6>I would agree with you.</v>

5118
02:27:41.171 --> 02:27:41.861
<v Speaker 6>It should be.</v>

5119
02:27:41.861 --> 02:27:43.780
<v Speaker 6>But I think that this sort of the professionals and,</v>

5120
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:44.120
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>

5121
02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:47.080
<v Speaker 6>they're professional skeptics like French and why has been the guys that I</v>

5122
02:27:47.081 --> 02:27:49.300
<v Speaker 6>mentioned before who will engage in a,</v>

5123
02:27:49.301 --> 02:27:49.541
<v Speaker 6>in a,</v>

5124
02:27:49.541 --> 02:27:51.730
<v Speaker 6>in a reasonable conversation about this,</v>

5125
02:27:51.731 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 6>but then they're skeptics to me like the j Raf,</v>

5126
02:27:54.890 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 6>the James Writing Educational Foundation,</v>

5127
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:59.860
<v Speaker 6>those guys who are or are just kind of rejecting it out of hand.</v>

5128
02:28:00.130 --> 02:28:01.630
<v Speaker 6>But there's really something,</v>

5129
02:28:01.631 --> 02:28:02.550
<v Speaker 6>there is something to,</v>

5130
02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:03.671
<v Speaker 6>to look at here.</v>

5131
02:28:03.671 --> 02:28:05.950
<v Speaker 6>There's something to wonder about and I find that,</v>

5132
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5133
02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:07.253
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5134
02:28:07.930 --> 02:28:08.640
<v Speaker 6>number one,</v>

5135
02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:08.711
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5136
02:28:08.711 --> 02:28:11.590
<v Speaker 6>more fucking accurate way of looking at it and which is great.</v>

5137
02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:12.250
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5138
02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:17.250
<v Speaker 6>And it's also a far more interesting world than the tiny percentage bump is</v>

5139
02:28:19.211 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 6>really fascinating because it really makes</v>

5140
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

5141
02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5142
02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe it is an emerging skill or maybe it is an emerging sense or as you said</v>

5143
02:28:28.161 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

5144
02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:30.470
<v Speaker 2>declining one because we don't,</v>

5145
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:31.580
<v Speaker 2>we don't use it in the,</v>

5146
02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:32.520
<v Speaker 2>the natural yeah.</v>

5147
02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.560
<v Speaker 6>World anymore and don't cultivate it at all.</v>

5148
02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:35.060
<v Speaker 6>And in,</v>

5149
02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:35.340
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5150
02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:35.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5151
02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:35.880
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5152
02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.230
<v Speaker 6>it's a figure when you look at that,</v>

5153
02:28:37.231 --> 02:28:39.660
<v Speaker 6>like the canceled affect 32 versus 25,</v>

5154
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:39.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5155
02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:41.670
<v Speaker 6>or whatever an individual study might show,</v>

5156
02:28:41.671 --> 02:28:42.450
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5157
02:28:42.450 --> 02:28:43.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5158
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:44.910
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that's powerful about that figure,</v>

5159
02:28:44.970 --> 02:28:47.790
<v Speaker 6>and it speaks to one of the things the skeptics do well,</v>

5160
02:28:48.210 --> 02:28:48.421
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

5161
02:28:48.421 --> 02:28:51.970
<v Speaker 6>is they warn you away from those people who really are con artists,</v>

5162
02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:52.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5163
02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:54.840
<v Speaker 6>The idea of the Super Psychic John Edwards,</v>

5164
02:28:54.841 --> 02:28:55.674
<v Speaker 6>Sylvia Brown,</v>

5165
02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.550
<v Speaker 6>there is threadbare,</v>

5166
02:28:57.840 --> 02:28:58.081
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5167
02:28:58.081 --> 02:28:58.831
<v Speaker 6>evidence for that.</v>

5168
02:28:58.831 --> 02:29:03.780
<v Speaker 6>It's not something that I would put my name on and reputation on is saying</v>

5169
02:29:03.781 --> 02:29:05.820
<v Speaker 6>there's something we really need to look at this,</v>

5170
02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:06.360
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5171
02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:07.380
<v Speaker 6>But the Ganzfeld effect,</v>

5172
02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:09.360
<v Speaker 6>there's so many studies,</v>

5173
02:29:09.361 --> 02:29:11.260
<v Speaker 6>dozens and dozens of studies that,</v>

5174
02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:12.193
<v Speaker 6>that go into these,</v>

5175
02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:14.970
<v Speaker 6>what they call these men analyses when they crunch all the numbers together that</v>

5176
02:29:14.971 --> 02:29:16.020
<v Speaker 6>I will put my name on and say,</v>

5177
02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:16.260
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

5178
02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:17.370
<v Speaker 6>We should fucking look at that.</v>

5179
02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:18.180
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5180
02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:18.720
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5181
02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:20.570
<v Speaker 6>and so it's not that the skeptics are,</v>

5182
02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:21.960
<v Speaker 6>are all wrong or all wet,</v>

5183
02:29:21.961 --> 02:29:22.231
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5184
02:29:22.231 --> 02:29:23.850
<v Speaker 6>But they paint with far too broad a brush.</v>

5185
02:29:23.851 --> 02:29:25.500
<v Speaker 6>And I think at the end of the day,</v>

5186
02:29:25.530 --> 02:29:25.790
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

5187
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:30.330
<v Speaker 6>my own guests and their motivation is the fact that that mechanism would be</v>

5188
02:29:30.331 --> 02:29:31.021
<v Speaker 6>unexplained.</v>

5189
02:29:31.021 --> 02:29:35.610
<v Speaker 6>The fact that that mechanism would suggest there is more to us than meat is not</v>

5190
02:29:35.611 --> 02:29:36.600
<v Speaker 6>something that won't acknowledge.</v>

5191
02:29:36.601 --> 02:29:38.100
<v Speaker 6>Because when you really look at these people,</v>

5192
02:29:38.101 --> 02:29:38.701
<v Speaker 6>when you look at Randy,</v>

5193
02:29:38.701 --> 02:29:40.200
<v Speaker 6>he's also a dogmatic atheist.</v>

5194
02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:43.740
<v Speaker 6>The idea that we're more than meets starts to introduce the idea of a soul,</v>

5195
02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:44.221
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5196
02:29:44.221 --> 02:29:46.050
<v Speaker 6>Something that will transcend this bodily death.</v>

5197
02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:47.850
<v Speaker 6>And the idea that we have to,</v>

5198
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:48.440
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5199
02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:48.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5200
02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:51.980
<v Speaker 6>worry about that to some degree and govern our behavior based on what we're</v>

5201
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:54.090
<v Speaker 6>going to become leader or what we're going to have to deal with later</v>

5202
02:29:54.210 --> 02:29:55.043
<v Speaker 6>potentially.</v>

5203
02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:58.080
<v Speaker 6>And so I think that they're kind of keeping the barn door shot,</v>

5204
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.351
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5205
02:29:58.351 --> 02:29:59.970
<v Speaker 6>They've taken on this tack in life,</v>

5206
02:30:00.350 --> 02:30:00.930
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5207
02:30:00.930 --> 02:30:04.290
<v Speaker 6>that they're going to hold this shit down,</v>

5208
02:30:04.890 --> 02:30:06.230
<v Speaker 6>that fringe ideas,</v>

5209
02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.520
<v Speaker 6>the unexplained anything,</v>

5210
02:30:08.610 --> 02:30:09.443
<v Speaker 6>a cult,</v>

5211
02:30:09.450 --> 02:30:10.230
<v Speaker 6>what have you.</v>

5212
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5213
02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:13.050
<v Speaker 6>All those things are just,</v>

5214
02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:13.450
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5215
02:30:13.450 --> 02:30:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Not to be,</v>

5216
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>not to be given any,</v>

5217
02:30:15.310 --> 02:30:16.120
<v Speaker 2>any power,</v>

5218
02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:18.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of unscientific to block out anything,</v>

5219
02:30:18.431 --> 02:30:18.940
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

5220
02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5221
02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:19.910
<v Speaker 2>The I,</v>

5222
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:22.120
<v Speaker 2>the idea of science is to observe everything.</v>

5223
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5224
02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Even very infrequent,</v>

5225
02:30:23.921 --> 02:30:25.330
<v Speaker 2>but possibly real events.</v>

5226
02:30:25.331 --> 02:30:26.164
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5227
02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5228
02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5229
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:28.960
<v Speaker 2>And you're a fucking scientist evoke.</v>

5230
02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:30.100
<v Speaker 2>You're a scientist.</v>

5231
02:30:30.101 --> 02:30:30.934
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

5232
02:30:31.450 --> 02:30:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And the book is a fringe Ologie and it sounds fucking awesome man.</v>

5233
02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:35.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5234
02:30:35.791 --> 02:30:36.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5235
02:30:36.151 --> 02:30:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get into this dude,</v>

5236
02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:39.820
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for coming on the podcast.</v>

5237
02:30:39.821 --> 02:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for getting the book and thanks for telling them to keep it at a dollar</v>

5238
02:30:43.001 --> 02:30:44.890
<v Speaker 2>99 which you can get it right now.</v>

5239
02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:46.540
<v Speaker 6>I just want to say one more thing.</v>

5240
02:30:46.541 --> 02:30:47.374
<v Speaker 6>I just can see this.</v>

5241
02:30:47.650 --> 02:30:49.090
<v Speaker 6>All the interviews I've done now,</v>

5242
02:30:49.091 --> 02:30:50.230
<v Speaker 6>and I've done a ton of them.</v>

5243
02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:51.970
<v Speaker 6>This was the biggest honor.</v>

5244
02:30:51.971 --> 02:30:55.690
<v Speaker 6>And the reason is because I've been listening to this podcast for the last</v>

5245
02:30:55.690 --> 02:30:55.901
<v Speaker 6>couple of years now,</v>

5246
02:30:55.901 --> 02:30:57.790
<v Speaker 6>like year and a half or more.</v>

5247
02:30:58.090 --> 02:30:58.871
<v Speaker 6>And I find,</v>

5248
02:30:58.871 --> 02:30:59.261
<v Speaker 6>and it's so,</v>

5249
02:30:59.261 --> 02:30:59.561
<v Speaker 6>it's funny,</v>

5250
02:30:59.561 --> 02:31:03.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure any guests you've had on in this position where this show is become</v>

5251
02:31:03.971 --> 02:31:05.920
<v Speaker 6>part of the way I reinforce my own good habits.</v>

5252
02:31:05.921 --> 02:31:07.000
<v Speaker 6>Like I find that it,</v>

5253
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:08.920
<v Speaker 6>it just keeps me motivated.</v>

5254
02:31:08.921 --> 02:31:10.150
<v Speaker 6>It keeps me focused on,</v>

5255
02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:11.740
<v Speaker 6>I think of there's podcasts ultimately,</v>

5256
