30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.080

You know,
basically there's already been supplements that uh,
you know,

31
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:46.550
there's like brain factor supplements.

32
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.500
Like Larry's company even had a brain factors,

33
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:52.520
but what did he did is he did that and fucking ran with it and made it the best

34
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:54.650
it could possibly be.
You get the best shit,

the best quality gourmet brain factor supplement.
Right?

36
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.060
There's been plenty of them,
but this one's gourmet.
Um,
do the same thing with,

37
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.630
you know,
Dick Pills,
you know,

uh,

38
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.100
herbal Viagra take that shit and that shit,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.340

I think it's all about,
um,</v>

40
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.510
nitric oxide.
That's a,
that's what like,

41
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.900
that's also in like Jack Three d and things along those lines.

42
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.220
Like that's one of the reasons why they say that.

43
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.940
Viagara it is actually like a performance enhancing supplement.

44
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.730
Did you know that athletes take Viagra now?
Okay.

45
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.060
<v 1>Hell yeah.
No,
no.</v>

46
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.040
Up with it actually helps your athletic performance.
Oh,
that's what they say.

47
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.980
That's what they tell them.
They find the Viagara bottom.

48
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.910
This is how you've been fucking me for two hours straight.
Oh No,
no,
no.
It's,

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.090
it's for bug muscle recovery.
It's hilarious.
Come on.
Yeah.

50
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:51.860
They fund decided to Vic study for it.

51
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.220
What you got to tell the bitches when you get caught with via the phone,

52
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.840
a bodybuilding thing,
you know,
my thing was fine.

53
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.010
Could you imagine if it was a grand conspiracy

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.890
<v 2>and that is really what it was for you just uncovered.
They said,
hey,</v>

55
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.230
let's talk about this on the podcast.
She's the music making a visual Brian,

56
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.960
and we haven't even started.
No,
Bro was creek

57
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.630
<v 3>exploring?
I was a whole.</v>

58
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.540
People are hearing it did see it's an illusion.
It did start,

59
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.460
but yet it didn't start.
It does our official sweet

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.290
<v 2>tea start until the music starts,</v>

61
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.440
but all that other stuff was recorded and broadcast.

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.220
So it did start you guys an a professional radio show.
You got an intro.

63
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.400
That's right Eddie.
You know why?
Because I want to,
if you,

64
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.520
if someone ever wanted to edit it,

65
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.510
I wanted to make it as easy as possible until you got with the advertisements

66
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.490
are,
but I also wanted to make the advertisements as organic as possible without

67
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.040
sounding like too much of a queen mushroom dog.

68
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.240
What does the idea of mushroom head cog,
the dog part of it.

69
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.780
You want to fuck like dog?

70
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.280
C'Mon mushroom Dong mushroom dog.
Right.

71
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.750
You may be a car just like a wolf,
like dog with a giant boner as the logo.

72
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.630
Well,
you know,
they used to say that that's where the vikings,

73
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.550
the vikings used to take mushrooms and I think it was the Amanita miscarry.

74
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.490
It was,
I think that's the mushroom they're supposedly taken and they would,
uh,

75
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.200
they would go into berserker mode.

76
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.140
They would get fucked up on mushrooms before they would go.
And Jack People,

77
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.790
you know,
I mean,
is there a mushroom that enhances sexual performance?

78
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.140
I mean,

79
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.060
don't the mushroom experts say that being on mushrooms makes you sexual?

80
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.030
The Times I've been on restrooms,
I definitely was sexual.

81
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.440
You want a massage and sex feels awesome.
Yeah,
definitely.
Yeah,

82
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.360
I agree with that.
So in terms of like how it feels,
yeah,
like marijuana too.

83
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.570
I mean,
especially when you eat it.
God Damn Man,

84
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.260
if you and your lady like a little pop brown he together and you chill together

85
00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:00.610
for an hour and wait until it kicks in and woo,
you could have some intense sex.

86
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:05.500
It's like,
it's almost like a psychedelic experience,
man.
It gets,

87
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.430
it gets dark.
It's a,
it's um,
I think,

88
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.740
I think that like,
you know,

89
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.040
most things that are as far as like,

90
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:20.041
feel and sensual things like music and stuff along those lines,

91
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.280
most of those things are accentuated by marijuana.

92
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.540
Absolutely.
Right.
Of course.
You're the,

93
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.390
you're the first person that introduced me to marijuana for people don't even

94
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:36.220
know Eddie Bravo back in the day got me high.
And then we had ice cream Sundaes.

95
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:40.270
It was the greatest experience of my life because when I started smoking weed,

96
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.140
everyone thought I was fucking crazy at the gym,
at Jujitsu.

97
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.710
I was a purple belt when I started and I just became a hemp activist trying to,

98
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.200
you know,
uh,

99
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.220
preached the truth about weed and everyone thought I was crazy.

100
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:58.100
And then I thought,
man,
if I can get Joe,
Joe was smart.
Everybody

101
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.450
<v 1>listens to them.
If I can just get Joe Haj and his,
you know,</v>

102
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.200
I knew for sure your comedy would just fucking just sprout.

103
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:10.760
I knew I was 1000000% sure.
I just had to talk you into it and you weren't easy.

104
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.150
It took a couple months of sitting down and talking to you.
You were like,

105
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.620
you know,
you were like me.
I was like,

106
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.310
I was not intuitive at all up until I was 28 I thought it made a fucking stupid.

107
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.080
I thought it turned you into a loser.

108
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.770
I don't think he took down long for me to do it,
dude.
There was a couple of them.

109
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.150
I remember one time I was on the 101 freeway going over Lankershim and out.

110
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.180
I had you like,
we can just start talking about weed all the time.

111
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.890
I would seem like a fucking,
just some insane dude if I just brought up weed.

112
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.670
My mission was it just,

113
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:41.620
I just had to sprinkle it in sometimes in our conversation and then I had you,

114
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.070
I was talking to,

115
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.670
I was on the freeway and I didn't want to go over the pass and lose you.

116
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.380
It's such an important call that I pulled over on the freeway to finish my
point.

117
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.790
Some stories,
some analogy,
some weed analogy,
some historical facts.

118
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.130
You know some shit that I was reading from Jack Herrera's book.

119
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.620
I had that shit memorize.
I would,
I would,

120
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.240
I would xerox the chapters and have make copies of the chapters and I'd be a

121
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:09.410
Jujitsu and just handing them to do this because I couldn't hand them books as I

122
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.740
was a brokester.
It's right.
I remember was I would pass out pamphlets of all,

123
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.460
I would just xerox shit from Jack Rogers.
Bill people thought I was nuts.

124
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.140
It was crazy.
That's totally why funny.
That's so funny man.

125
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.610
You're that guy.
You're that back a locker room handing out leaflets.
But Hey man,

126
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.610
that's what you had to do before the Internet and that's what I was doing.
I do.

127
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.760
I just want her to do because we're human internet.
Yeah.

128
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.830
Once people started to think I was crazy,

129
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.100
that just drove me and now I got approved of these motherfuckers that I'm so I

130
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.280
would bring in Pampa it's like we'll just read that just as one fucking page and

131
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.500
if you want read the second page and then people,

132
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:45.200
it was making sense still a lot of people,
but still,
you know,

133
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:47.570
most people like myself were totally afraid of it.

134
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.070
And then when I started hanging out with Joe,
it was,

135
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.000
it was at them.
I heard about you training.

136
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.580
I heard that that was an actor guide training at the gym.

137
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.300
It was before fear factor was like during the news radio.
And so I was like,
yeah,

138
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.880
there's an actor duties on NBC.
He,
you know,

139
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:09.830
he trains at night or whatever and I was trained during the day and I ran into

140
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:11.530
you once or twice go,
oh that's that actor dude.

141
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:14.570
Never watched the news radio but I saw you at the comedy store.

142
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.540
I love going to the comedy store.
And I was out with some chick and I'm like,

143
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.260
that's that dude.
The trains at my school does celebrity dude.

144
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.930
And then you got off stage.
I'm like,
hey dude,
I train Jujitsu.
You remember me?

145
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:27.140
And you're like,
Oh shit,
you got the Machados.
And we just started talking there.

146
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.690
Eddie.
Eddie thought that some of them was fucking with him at a diner cause ed

147
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.490
couldn't,
you didn't have your,
your contacts on this.

148
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.410
I didn't have my contacts on his nighttime.
I was kind of a little tipsy.

149
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.900
And you actually recognized me and I didn't recognize you,
right?
Yeah,
I was.

150
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.150
I was,
uh,
outside of your range of vision and you're like,
oh dude,

151
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:51.500
I can't see shit outside.
How bad is your vision if you don't have contacts on?

152
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.070
Um,
it's not that bad.
It's,
I just,

153
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 2>if I,
if I'm like 10 yards away from me,</v>

154
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.590
you started getting a little fuzzy right now.

155
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.290
Do I look like a pretty girl right now who maybe have my contacts in maybe up,

156
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.640
maybe I no.
Steiner.
How's it most donor and I was walking.

157
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.940
I thought you were like hitting on the checkout or something.
Right?
But you want,

158
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.300
I don't,
I don't know what you saw.
I think you thought it was fucking with you.

159
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.830
I think you thought it was fucking with you.
I don't know.

160
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.170
I don't remember what it was.
I was,
I was just,
I don't remember what I said.

161
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.070
I was just like,
Yo,
Eddie,
Yo Eddie,
and for whatever reason,

162
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.010
like your brain misinterpreted that as someone fucking with you.

163
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.530
And then you're like,
oh hey dude.
Oh Damn.

164
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I could've swore it was you saying that you couldn't see that good?
Yeah,

165
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.040
I couldn't see that.
Good.
And I actually thought you were,

166
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.080
you were fucking with me or I dunno what it was,
but I could not see that good.

167
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.840
That trips me the fuck out because my eyes are going,
man.

168
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.730
I barely knew I didn't watch news radio.
Um,

169
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.670
there's a lot of dudes that go to the gym.
I met you once or twice.

170
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.590
I was probably faded and you know,
and someone's calling me and I'm like,

171
00:09:58.591 --> 00:09:59.580
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

172
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.930
But then you were taking privates from Sylvio at the time.

173
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.710
I remember you were only doing privates in the beginning.

174
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:10.170
You weren't rolling and you thought you were doing the best shit.
Right.

175
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.910
I was the one rolling with him

176
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.120
and then you guys were like on an off hour.
You invited me one time.

177
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.900
Remember she was giving you a private and you invited me to come down to roll

178
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.410
too stoned and strangled me.

179
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.350
It was so high.
I can totally remember that till I got you in a twister to,
oh,

180
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.680
did you got me in everything?
I think I just got your month.

181
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.180
It's like he got me a couple times,
so then it was more than once.

182
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.270
I think it was like twice.
I was just a purple belt.
I wasn't that good.

183
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.980
And you're fucking,
you came in strong.
I didn't know what you were doing.

184
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.300
No idea what you're doing when you went for that twist to roll,
dude,

185
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.260
I was so lost.
That's when we started training together.

186
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.690
That was so fucking long ago.
Long the ago,
and then,

187
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.920
and then we ran into each other and 97 in Louisiana.

188
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.000
A UFC.
You were with Ricky rocket.
Yeah,
I was with Ricky,

189
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:04.200
rocket drummer for poison.
I just recently met him.
We were a,
I don't think I did.

190
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.290
I meet him back then.
I don't know if I met him back then.

191
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.460
I might've met him back then,
but I recently met him at the hard rock.

192
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:15.220
He's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.
The drummer of poison.
All that makeup.

193
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.440
Yeah.
Try to lineage.
Yeah.
He's hardcore martial artist.

194
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:24.441
He was way into Jeet Kune Doe as well and like weapons and shit like that.

195
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.340
He wasn't before Jujitsu blew up,
he was already into confluence.
Right.

196
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.410
He didn't and he just jumped on Jiu Jitsu,
you know,

197
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.530
cause he's smart and I love when people get into it.
When,
what's his name?

198
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:38.030
Jonathan Lipnick.
Nikki is on his name.
The young kid who was an it.

199
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.630
Was He from Jerry Maguire?
Yeah.
Yeah.

200
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:41.640
That young kid from Jerry Maguire's really good.

201
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:44.730
Apparently apparently Heffron roles than them.
He strangles have fraud.

202
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.510
That's crazy.
Isn't that awesome?
I love hearing shit like that.
Man.

203
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.740
That is crazy though,
right?

204
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.680
It's one of the coolest things that I hear when we go on the road when we do

205
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:55.630
comedy shows is how many people come out to me after the show and tell me that

206
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.450
they start doing Jujitsu after they listen to the pod.

207
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.150
I get those tweets all the time and they was tagging them until,

208
00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:04.210
I'm sure he said yeah,
all the time.
All the time.

209
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.100
And I meet those folks when I do comedy shows.
Man This uh,
this past weekend,

210
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:09.934
Fort Lauderdale,

211
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.960
I met a gang of dudes or talking to me about Jujitsu gang of dudes that had,

212
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.900
hadn't done Jujitsu until they listened to the podcast.

213
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.090
It's just one after the other would come and tell him at that,

214
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.100
which is awesome man.
You hear shit like that.
Isn't that crazy?
Awesome.

215
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.820
The drummer for poison is a bad motherfucker.
Strangle people.

216
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.030
Yeah.
It's crazy,
right?
Fuck yeah.

217
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.070
Nobody wore more makeup than poison will fuck you with weapons come through with

218
00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.810
what I know.

219
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.890
No one ever really gave a fuck about the dudes in the crazy hair and makeup

220
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.250
doing that because everybody knew they were doing that because they were rock

221
00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.600
stars when they got insane amounts of pussy.
It's like,
it was never even,

222
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.720
I mean even if you were like,
oh look at what they're doing and they'll get,

223
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.510
you're wearing crazy lipstick and crazy makeup,

224
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:58.410
but they got so much pussy you couldn't say shit.
Yeah.
Mean,

225
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.320
that's basically the more feminine they go,
they're going to,

226
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.620
the more pussy you get,

227
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.510
the more you could dress like a check cause no one can say shit.
Yeah man.

228
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.520
I mean the hot chicks around you,

229
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.290
you can just start fucking it dick and you'll be fine.
No,
I got all these ticks.

230
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.030
I Dunno about that.
I don't know about that.

231
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:18.470
I think you would lose a lot of people with that.
I don't know.

232
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.430
I don't know everyone.
You know what?

233
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.430
You know there's rumors about David Bowie and you hear this Mick Jagger rumors

234
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.010
that the Rod Stewart,
but what I'm,
it's just like the Richard Gere,

235
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.830
a durable rumor.
You know,
you got to wonder,
you know,

236
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.860
how easy was it to spread a rumor back then?
I mean,
did,

237
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.640
did Mick Jagger and and Dave Bowie really go to bed?
Really?

238
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.270
That's a serious rumor.
That's an incredible rumor.
They're durable rumor.

239
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.550
I think it was one of the wives said it though that she walked in on them,

240
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.750
which is always,
it has to be in bed for that.

241
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.950
I think back then the internet was a the tabloids.

242
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.630
That's it.
Newspapers you see at the store and everyone goes to,

243
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.590
everyone goes to rite aid and when it goes to a drug store,

244
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.650
everyone goes to the airport.
Yeah,
when you see,
yeah,

245
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.840
those are like those crazy sites.
You can get that shit out real quick number.

246
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.630
It's like extra,
extra.
Read all about it.

247
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.440
If you made the front page of some newspaper back then everybody read the

248
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.410
newspaper now,
what was the last time you would write or read a newspaper?

249
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.100
I've rarely read news.
I go to Starbucks,

250
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:27.160
I'll read the cover and I read the cover at Starbucks.
That's it.

251
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.170
Go through that shit.
I'll do it.

252
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:33.880
If I'm on the road by myself and I'm really fucking board of jet,

253
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.830
the New York Times,
I'll get the New York times and I'll go through.

254
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.100
I never really get the newspaper and I probably should,
but it's like,
man,

255
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:45.460
I don't,
I don't know.
It's outdated and newspapers are outdated.

256
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.700
You already know all this shit in a newspaper like 12 hours before you see it in

257
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:52.050
the newspaper.
Yeah.
Rulings in an effective way of doing it.
That's why

258
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.300
<v 0>it hurt and that's why New York Times on the iPads probably going to one day be</v>

259
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.570
more popular than the regular near for sure.
For sure.

260
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.460
What's really important though,
real journalism is really important,

261
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.850
but it's real scary and it's really dangerous.

262
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.390
Like for someone to really dig deep,
like Matt Tie,

263
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:14.780
he be style into the inner workings of the government and corruption,

264
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:19.220
Goldman Sachs and all that shit.
Dude,
that's terrifying.
But that,

265
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:22.820
that kind of shit that's,
we need a lot of that.

266
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.850
There's a lot of chaos and corruption going on and it just seems every year like

267
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:33.341
it's like more and more just a part of the way we just accept that this is life.

268
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.350
How this life is set up the way that we don't,
we don't even,
we don't even,

269
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.730
<v 1>no one's going to do anything about it.
No one's doing shit about nothing.</v>

270
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.460
Just the way it runs,
man.
It's not going to go,
you know,

271
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.030
it's going to take a lot to shift the power back to the people.

272
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.560
It's going to take fucking

273
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.920
<v 0>miracle,
man.
It's amazing,
isn't it?</v>

274
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.560
I mean the situation that we're in right now,

275
00:15:56.561 --> 00:16:00.250
it's amazing because this is the first time where people have really kind of

276
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.600
truly been aware of how the whole system runs,
you know,

277
00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:07.390
and you look at all these different,
you know,

278
00:16:07.391 --> 00:16:11.110
National Defense Authorization Act and this new one that doesn't allow you to do

279
00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:15.460
any protests where there's secret service anywhere nearby.
Yeah,
you can't,

280
00:16:15.461 --> 00:16:16.840
you can get arrested.
It's a felony,

281
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:20.650
which means you go to jail for over a year for protesting,

282
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.220
which is supposed to be a part of our constitutional rights,

283
00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:28.660
the right to protest,
but they just recently passed the law.
Obama signed it.

284
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:33.430
That if you protest in front of secret service agents while secret service

285
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:37.720
agents or protecting someone,
it could be a candidate.
It could be a journalist,

286
00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:38.820
someone who works for the widest,

287
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.900
whoever the fuck the secret services protecting.

288
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.470
If you are protesting in front of them,
that's a felony.

289
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.840
That's crazy.
Yeah.

290
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.770
<v 1>That man was communist Cuba type shit.
That doesn't shock me that,</v>

291
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.950
that just make fucking sense.
The way the presidency is turning out,

292
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.000
it's for 1000000%.

293
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.650
Obama is going to win again.
I mean,
they're just for sure he's going to one.

294
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.950
There's no way he's gotten so much done for fucking big business.

295
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.000
There's no way he's not going to win.
There's Mitt Romney,
it's,
he's,

296
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.500
he's got youtube videos where they show him lying back and forth evidence in

297
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.980
your face.
Him Flip flopping.
It's just blasted out.

298
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.590
He's caught lying so many times and he's the dude is gonna uh,

299
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.100
go against Obama.
It's,
it's uh,
they,
they,
they want Obama back end.

300
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:31.760
Obama is Stan.
Let's shit set up.
No Way.
I think all the other ones

301
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.520
<v 0>that good.
You know,
you see that though.</v>

302
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:39.521
But you know how many old racist white people are just so looking again at white

303
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:43.640
guy back in power and especially a white republican to straighten things out.

304
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.870
Regular Mitt Romney,
regular people,
Mitt Romney's flip flops.

305
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.100
That's all well and good.

306
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.650
As long as people accept him and liked him enough so they can get him to be

307
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:54.600
their puppet because that's all they're looking for,

308
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.330
they're looking to get a puppet in place.
I don't think,

309
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.090
I don't think regular people going to mind nearly as much as you'd think.

310
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.200
You know what?
Who knows what the fuck has happened.
And that's just my guess.

311
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.830
My guess is my guess is it has 1000000%.
Obama's gonna win.
It looks,

312
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:10.380
it looks like he's being set up to win.
He's just,

313
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.400
he's just looks like so powerful right now.
Roseanne Barr is Christ.

314
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.180
That guy's a joke.
Roseanne Barr.
Why?
Why do you say,
well,
he's up for,

315
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.820
she's trying to be president.
It should really?
Yeah.

316
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.500
She was in this place at eight the other day,
the waitress had his badge on it.

317
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.190
Susan or Roseanne Barr for president.
And I was like,
why?
Why do you have that?

318
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.850
She goes,
oh,
she's running for president.
And she was here like an hour ago.
Well,

319
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.880
I'll tell you what,
dude.
She for sure to be governor,
you know,

320
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.700
she wanted to start off as governor and work your way up to president.

321
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.210
If there's any woman who I think might be able to do something like that,

322
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.740
she could do it.
Well,
it sends a powerful woman.
You know what I mean?

323
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.110
That's a bad ass bitch.
I mean,
Roseanne Barr was a killer standup comedian.

324
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.030
She was a killer man back in the day.
You know,
it's crazy.

325
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.740
Look at that picture of,
tell you what dude,
she's fucking smart man.

326
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.810
Read or tweets.
She said some smart shit.
She's cool.
She's,
you know,
she's,

327
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.660
she's obviously crazy.
She's a comedian.
We're all crazy,
crazy in bed.
Oh,
Brian,

328
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.850
you think?
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Tom Arnold burn

329
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.420
when you're a dude like Tom Arnold.
That's a,
that's a tricky situation.

330
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.550
There's so obviously he's a talented guy.
We,
Tom Arnold,
I like Tom Arnold.

331
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:28.470
I've been on that best damn sports show with them.

332
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.580
It's very nice guy and obviously talented.
He's really funny in that movie.

333
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:33.600
Did what?
All towards and anger.

334
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.350
But when you're a dude and you're married to one of those super powerful women,

335
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.840
like,
man,
that's gotta be a weird spot.

336
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.600
He seems like he would give me heart palpitations just being around him,

337
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.740
you know,
it just seems too intense and fast.
Like,
I dunno,

338
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.480
I dunno.
He was cool.
I liked him.
But that's a tough spot being,

339
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:55.830
being married to the super woman,
you know,
that's hard.

340
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.770
Good luck with that.
Usually the,

341
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:02.910
they'd be like a really quiet personal trainer type dude.

342
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.280
So do to gets like really good massages or can eat or box.

343
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.690
Did you hear about all those hookers?

344
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.670
What ha the hookers in New York City or to Colombian secret service.
Yeah.
Yeah,

345
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:15.450
they were awesome.

346
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.870
The secret service were in a brothel and Columbia and apparently one of the

347
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:22.120
secret service guys refused to pay and uh,

348
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.430
it became like this big thing where they brought in the police,
you know,

349
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.800
cause you can't just do that.
And so,
uh,

350
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.160
this is their story.
Who knows what really happened.

351
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.820
But apparently the secret service was just going at it in Columbia.
Yeah.

352
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:39.510
They went there like a week early and just getting wasted and getting girls.

353
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.550
And I guess there's up to like 15 girls that,

354
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.220
that checked in because it's his story ever get out.

355
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.710
This seems to me like who the,

356
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.300
how could anybody mismanaged something like this to the point where they are led

357
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.840
this story get out?
Well because there's so many people involved in every time a,

358
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.750
a hook,
the hookers or I think it legal there.

359
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.680
So they work these things with the hotels for security reasons.

360
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:05.260
Like if you're going to be coming in the hotel to be a hooker,

361
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.710
then you have to leave your id at the front desk.
And uh,

362
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:12.430
so it's kind of like on paperwork,
like it's illegal,
it's tolerated,

363
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:16.210
but there's also a trails for everything.
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

364
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.420
So while we don't know what happened,

365
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:23.200
but apparently she said that he didn't want to pay.
That's what you said.
Uh,

366
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:27.670
I dunno.
I think that's what it is.
Like something happened up there.
That part.

367
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:29.590
I know it's so soon.
What does it so shocking?

368
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:32.090
The secret service guys would like some socks.
Yeah.

369
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.100
They're big brawny men that are,
uh,

370
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.840
assigned to protect one of the most powerful people on the planet.

371
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.790
Can they get a little sex?
Does that okay.

372
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.840
But you went to crazy is that these guys,
Hayden,

373
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.300
he's hookers were allowed inside their hotel rooms where they had like

374
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.970
itineraries for what?
Like Obama schedule was.

375
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:52.570
While he's going to be visiting and stuff like that.
Like,
like insane shit,

376
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:57.110
like sloppy shit.
That's really fucked up.
Oh,
you sure about that?
Yeah.
Yeah.

377
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.150
Heard it on Howard today.
Oh,
okay.
I don't know.

378
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.260
I think I reserve judgment until I know anything.

379
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.450
I don't know what really happened.
Who knows?
You know,
when,

380
00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:12.000
when someone says as long as there was single,
you know what I mean?
Who Cares?

381
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.510
The all the,
uh,
you know,
it was,
um,

382
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.560
well someone said that he didn't pay.
That was like the big dispute or something.

383
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:22.150
Has something happened where someone,

384
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.360
which is crazy because I didn't know exactly what went down word for word like

385
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.580
this.
Wait a minute,
I didn't fuck you in your ass while you talking me 300.

386
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:35.610
[inaudible]

387
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.080
call your manager.
Call them,
call them.
Call your manager.

388
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.530
You know what the fuck I am?
I'm secret service bitch.
Whoa.

389
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.870
You think that's how the role did you imagine?
That'd be crazy.
So to speak,

390
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:54.610
in a secret service.
I would watch the,
you know,
there's these,
um,
folks,

391
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:56.680
uh,
at this production company that used to do that.

392
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.681
Jesse Ventura show the conspiracy theory show and I was talking to them about

393
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.800
this idea that they have and the wait if we get producers of that show.
Yes.

394
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.060
The producers of that show,

395
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.760
I was talking about to them about this idea that they had and as we got talking

396
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.461
somehow or another,

397
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:16.710
we got to talking about conspiracy theories because of that show and uh,

398
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.320
what they wanted that show to be,
what it ultimately became and how,

399
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:22.720
like did they weren't happy with the direction that it all went,

400
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.610
but they started talking to me about JFK and they're like,
like if you like,

401
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.990
have you seen our special on JFK?
I was wearing,
you know,
I mean,
I'm,

402
00:23:30.991 --> 00:23:34.150
I'm pretty familiar with the case.
You know,
I,
I know it pretty well.
I've,

403
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:37.360
I've read several books about it and I've watched a bunch of different

404
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:41.380
documentaries on it.
Well,
they gave me this,
that the Jesse Ventura episode of it.

405
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.560
It's fucking,
it's pretty interesting,
man.
It's hot.
Yeah.

406
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:49.040
It's pretty entity with learning the new things.
Well,
you know,
it's,

407
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.410
they set up a rifle thing.

408
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:56.411
We could see like the distance of how far he was shooting from the window and

409
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.150
like how accurate,
you know,

410
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:02.090
you could be with that rifle in that amount of time in six seconds,

411
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:06.560
fire off three shots
and you watch that and you go wow,

412
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.140
that's not likely.
It's not likely he did that.

413
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.270
So what's your theory on who did it and how did they get away through the,

414
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.970
well this is the other thing.
They,
they focused on this guy,

415
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.220
he Howard hunt who uh,

416
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:24.200
is an unknown assassin and known CIA agent,
a guy who was,
you know,

417
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.850
he was,
uh,

418
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.750
arrested in Watford Watergate and wound up doing time for that.

419
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:34.490
So you believe he was at Sas death by deathbed?
The CIA?
Yeah,
for sure.

420
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.840
I think if I had a gas,
yeah.
Cause he wanted to abolish the CIA.
Yeah.
I don't,

421
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.660
I think Lee Harvey Oswald probably wasn't innocent.
I mean it was,

422
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:44.660
it was pretty obvious that Lee Harvey Oswald was some sort of a government
agent.

423
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.350
But it seems more than likely when you look at all the evidence about how

424
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.200
fucking ridiculous the whole scenario was,

425
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.850
the way they were parading him in that open area with w where was totally

426
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:56.684
unprotected.

427
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.250
The president with the roof down and he slowed down around the turn.

428
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.300
The secret service guys are so much shit.
There's so much shit they,

429
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:08.870
this is a setup.
They set this up when they killed that fucking guy.
Yeah.

430
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:12.480
For someone.
For people not to at least say there's something fishy going.

431
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.790
Like what?
What is fishy to you?
Like you look at nine one one shit.

432
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:21.530
There's just so much fun.
Isn't it fishy that tower seven just fucking got demo.

433
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.470
Isn't that fucking fishy?
It does not ring a fucking bell.

434
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.420
Just so much nonsense with the,
with with the case,
the,

435
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.290
the single bullet theory is often debated.
Okay.
And the,

436
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:36.030
the scary thing about it is how many people are willing to come up with some

437
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.070
this weird,

438
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.340
irrational explanation for why this one bullet did all these unlikely things and

439
00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:46.520
then wound up on the Gurney.

440
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:51.650
And the only reason for that is because that one bullet helps negate the

441
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.130
possibility of conspiracy and attribute all three bolts to one guy.

442
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.110
And it's the only real reason to do it.

443
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.460
And the only reason they had to attribute this one bullet to all these wounds

444
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.250
was because there was a man under the underpass.

445
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.590
And this guy got hit in the face by a ricochet.

446
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:10.620
The Rick of the bullet hit the curb right in front of them.
And the,
uh,

447
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.860
the Kerbstone came up and fucked his head up.

448
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.070
So this guy had to go to the hospital and he told them what happened.

449
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.270
So they had,

450
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.840
they knew that was a shot that was in the record and they knew there was one

451
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.880
other wound to Kennedy that was in the record.

452
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.480
So the headshot or before the headshot,

453
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.620
the one that hit him in the back had to do all of his damage.

454
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.120
And then all the damage to governor Connally's.

455
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.590
Well since the only reason why they attributed to this one bullet and then they

456
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:40.470
magically find this bullet on a Gurney in the hospital and then the bullet

457
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.250
doesn't even have any damage to it.
The bull,

458
00:26:42.251 --> 00:26:44.250
it looks like a bullet been fire through water.

459
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.100
<v 2>It doesn't look like a bullet looks when it goes to two human beings.</v>

460
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:50.280
It just doesn't period.
I mean,
it's nonsense.

461
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:54.150
Every single test that they've ever done with,
they've tried to duplicate it.

462
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:56.730
They haven't been able to.
Mythbusters wasn't able to.

463
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.960
Every time they hit bone it,
fuck that bullet up.
It shattered that bullet.

464
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.590
That bull was all contorted and twisted,
not the magic bullet.

465
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.140
The magic bullet came out in near pristine condition,

466
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:09.930
like they shot it into a million pillows.
It looked amazing.

467
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.110
It didn't even look flattened.
That's some scary shit.

468
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.050
It's scary as fuck that people were willing to accept that.

469
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.260
The only reason that that is on record is because they wanted a conclusion that

470
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:23.820
they had already come up to would they?

471
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:28.140
They'd come up with is Lee Harvey Oswald was guilty long before this was ever,

472
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.370
this was ever a question.
It'd be hot to crave so much shit.

473
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.960
So much evidence of they wanted Lee Harvey Oswald to be guilty.

474
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:40.051
That was period.

475
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:43.890
That's what the Warren Commission was set up to show that Lee Harvey Oswald was

476
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:46.920
guilty.
That's why that best evidence book is so creepy.

477
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.210
It's fucking creepy subject,
isn't it?
That they killed the president.

478
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.820
It will be really cool to have.

479
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.600
It wasn't like Marilyn Monroe and Jimmy Hendrickson,

480
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.930
like a hot air balloon with two sniper rifles or something.

481
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.920
Like if it was something that sexy and awesome,

482
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.030
if they did a legitimate legit investigation where they were after the person

483
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:07.080
who shot.
If there were,
it would have a,
there was just too much fishy shit.

484
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.180
They wouldn't have.
They wouldn't.
They would have went after it.
Yeah.

485
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.380
Well the photos of the Howard hunt or ridiculous cause there's a photo of him.

486
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.160
They arrested three Hobos that when they were arrested,
by the way,

487
00:28:17.161 --> 00:28:19.290
right outside the area where the grassy knoll is,

488
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:21.330
where the supposedly the head shot came from.

489
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.980
The reason why Kennedy's head goes back into the left and there's a photo of him

490
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.580
when they were arresting these three Hobos.
He's Hobos were not Hobos,
man.

491
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:32.490
They were.
They were.
They looked like,
yeah,
they look like young men,

492
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:35.100
healthy people that didn't look like there's anything wrong with them.

493
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:37.110
They didn't look fucked up.
They look and he,

494
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:40.080
Howard Hunt is clearly in that photo.
You can pull the photo up.

495
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:45.290
He Howard hunt a JFK assassination photo and there's an,

496
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.010
yeah,
that's it man.

497
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.360
So you could see him see that guy with the hat and the back that is he Howard

498
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360
Hunt
and the they've done.

499
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:58.470
They've taken photo images and put his face over the face of of e Howard hunt,

500
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.280
his bone structure and everything and matches.
Exactly.
That guy was a killer.

501
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.580
That guy was a fucking killer and he was hanging out behind the grassy knoll,

502
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.470
the arrested those guys and then let them free it.

503
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.350
Didn't charge him with shit like hipsters now didn't charge him with shit

504
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.220
despite all the evidence that there was someone in the grassy knoll shooting

505
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.083
shooting guns,

506
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.970
there was all these people saying that shots were coming from behind them,

507
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:22.350
that we're standing in front of the grassy knoll.

508
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.620
They had all these witnesses and a huge amount of people mysteriously died that

509
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.570
were witnesses to this shit.
A huge amount.

510
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.640
There was a documentary they did where they,
they,
we talked about the odds.

511
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.450
What,
what the odds were that all these people who had witnessed the Kennedy

512
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:43.930
assassination would be killed in either violent murders or a horrible car.

513
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:47.310
Accidents or fires or you know,

514
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.760
train track accidents where they parked their car and train tracks.

515
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.770
They killed a lot of fucking people.
Man.
You know,
it's,

516
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.400
it's really possible that they tied up all the loose ends.

517
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.090
It's really possible that they killed the president and then they went out and

518
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:04.870
they killed a whole bunch of people that might have been able to tell that they

519
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:08.770
killed the president
and they clean that shit up.
Nice.

520
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.220
And they put it in a big book.
And they call it the Warren Commission report.

521
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.270
And then there you go.
There you go.
One like the nine one one commission reports.

522
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:18.990
Same thing.
Do you think that anything they think,

523
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.270
do you really think nine 11 was a conspiracy?
Is that what you're saying?

524
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.520
For sure.
I think it's just so damn fishy manages so much.
I mean,

525
00:30:26.521 --> 00:30:28.260
as an efficient fishy,

526
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.190
that tower seven got demos tower seven it's fishing is phots fishy,

527
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.430
but what's possible to me,

528
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.970
it's always possible in the back of my head that you got to look at
incompetence.

529
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.860
1500 engineers and architects and architects,

530
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.590
they say it's all bullshit.
That is tower seven right?

531
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.950
That's what their dispute is.
It's not one and two though,
right?
Uh,

532
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.390
well see the thing about one and two that a lot of people don't know when we're

533
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:58.990
talking about the towers,
it fell.
It's crazy.
Nine one one gets PVC.
Shit.

534
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.630
Fuck you real good.
I'm shutting this off right now.

535
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.410
I'm tired of you fucking pseudoscience towers one.

536
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:09.130
In Tower two we're really the only tower that we know of that's ever been hit by

537
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:13.210
a full jumbo jet.
Full fuel like that,
and who knows.

538
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:18.070
It might've been that design just was not really the right way to go if you're

539
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:22.060
going to get hit by a fucking plane because if you watch the way one in to fall,

540
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.380
to me,
they fall like a building that's falling apart,
which is like I would,

541
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.260
what I would assume would happen if if it started,
you know,

542
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.820
crumbling and crushing,
like it would fall apart that way.

543
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:39.360
When you look at tower seven now tower seven it goes into its base,

544
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.920
it collapses into its base.

545
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.790
It doesn't collapse from the top down and pancake like one and two.

546
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.280
There's video of it.
There's several angles of it.

547
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.350
We need to get to the bottom line.

548
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.880
It was left out of the nine one one commission report and then the explanations

549
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:59.260
for a fucking retarded.
You know,
nest came out and they get a presentation.

550
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:04.120
It's on Youtube and I s.
T.
It's ridiculous.
You think though,

551
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.830
here's what an alternate explanation do you think that tower seven first of all

552
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.620
was the the how it's the less sinister possibility.

553
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.360
Tower seven was home to a lot of different organizations,
right?

554
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:20.260
Like it wasn't the answer and there was a lot of different physical records that

555
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:23.800
were kept there that were lost completely in the demolition.

556
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.140
Is it possible that if you have a place or a building that's filled with so much

557
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:30.520
sensitive information,

558
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:35.440
so much dangerous sensitive information that they might have built it with the

559
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:40.441
designed to implode it whenever they want it to and in the case of a breach and

560
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:45.581
case of the possibility of losing all that information to you don't other

561
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:48.240
governments or or what have you?
Well,

562
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.060
if that was the only thing that was fishing,
there's like a thousand things,

563
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.720
right?
They're just so much shit.
That's just the most obvious.

564
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.370
That's the only thing I've looked at for that was the most not look at like the

565
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.450
Pentagon and all that shit.
There's so much,
but it is also possible.

566
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:04.580
I do also reserve the possibility that,

567
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:07.550
I don't know shit about architecture or engineering.

568
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.530
And then if you start a massive fucking gasoline fire in the basement of a

569
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.520
building and it turns into like essentially like one of the inside of one of

570
00:33:15.521 --> 00:33:20.150
those green egg ovens,
I don't think before the fall apart.
Look at tower seven.

571
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:23.840
There's several angles.
It gets demoed right in the middle of all that shit.

572
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.400
Well it certainly looks like add that to everything else.
And then you saw what,

573
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.920
what people are capable with JFK,

574
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:36.490
you know it's business as usual.
Did No,
maybe,
no,
I'm,

575
00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:37.910
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not saying it's not,

576
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.240
but I'm saying one of the things that's interesting is even though it does go in

577
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:45.440
like a controlled demolition,
it doesn't blow out like a controlled demolition.

578
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.440
It's almost like maybe they just like did a really sweet one.

579
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.320
We got a really nice way of doing this.

580
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.460
Minimal explosion really just kind of falls apart.

581
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.520
This information doesn't seem important enough for that though.
Like,
like,

582
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:02.990
like yeah,
it's security.
Security got breached,
but it also was an airplane.

583
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:06.230
Did it aside of a fucking,
you know,
building.

584
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.240
I don't think that that was like people jumping up there playing,

585
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:11.180
going like get the documents,
get all the important information,
you know?

586
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.710
They know.
I'm not saying that.

587
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:16.340
I'm saying that they built it to be able to do that to it.

588
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.710
You know what I'm saying?
You know what?
The very moment they built it,

589
00:34:18.711 --> 00:34:20.570
they knew that they were going to have the NSA there.

590
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.550
They knew they were going to have the DEA documents,

591
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:23.900
whatever the fuck they've got going on in there,

592
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.680
whatever crazy shit bankers there was.
There was a lot of different,

593
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.710
like really high level government organizations that have been run out of this

594
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:31.544
building.

595
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.470
If they wanted to design it like so that if at anything happened,

596
00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:38.240
if there was a fire one day they can just crush it.

597
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:41.090
They can just bring it down to the ground.
Maybe.
Maybe they got,

598
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:42.590
seems like a small possibility.

599
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:46.240
It's a small one that seems like that's if they went into stands out a little

600
00:34:46.241 --> 00:34:49.490
bit because it's not that I don't think.
Okay.
Because my question,

601
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:51.150
if it's not that,
but what is it they want?

602
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.750
What they loaded up the building while everybody was working in it.

603
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.220
That's highly unlikely.
It's,

604
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.520
it's highly unlikely that you could get away with loading up a building.

605
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:02.810
It takes weeks.
There's a laptop
up.
Yes.

606
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:08.170
Well when's the last time you remember talking about this?

607
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.930
Lots of evidence of there's lots of evidence.
Eyewitnesses.
Crazy.

608
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.050
Like for weeks and weeks,
workers coming in,
certain fans,

609
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:19.730
like there's a lot of testimony.
They're like,
yeah,

610
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:23.330
we just see these guys that work in here at off hours.
And Really?
Yeah,

611
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:28.120
there's so much evidence.
It's,
they did such a sloppy job.
They just want an,

612
00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:30.960
so who are these guys?
These guys that went and um,

613
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.690
who knows who all these explosives they're doing now is,

614
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.290
we don't know someone did it.
Someone did it.

615
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.050
<v 1>Tower seven control demo staff of Starbucks.
And then look at,</v>

616
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.610
look at the Pentagon.
They're saying a plane crashed into it.

617
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.040
And when you look at the rack there,
there's no plane wreckage.

618
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.870
That's another huge one.
The Pentagon,
a missile hit it or,
oh,
that was a bomb.

619
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:55.080
It was one on one or the other.
They finally released the explosion.

620
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:58.590
The three frames.
There's no plane.
Well,
there's something.
It hits it.

621
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:02.190
It looks like a missile,
but there's no record judge.
But is it,

622
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.620
it's no records isn't there.
Why haven't I?

623
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:09.080
Haven't I seen photos or you've got to look into this
now you see,

624
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.170
what'd you see as a photo up close of like some machine thing like up close.

625
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.270
That's not what I want to see.

626
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.460
What do you ever want to see a picture of backpack?

627
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:21.660
The whole front lawn where everything's all fucked up and there's suitcases and

628
00:36:21.661 --> 00:36:24.870
there's tennis shoes and there's shit that you see and there's been plenty of

629
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:27.660
planes wrecking.
They know what playing records looks like.

630
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.610
You see fucking seats everywhere.

631
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.080
They just came back and sprinkled some shit down immediately.

632
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:36.340
I remember when it was going on.
No one.

633
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.960
When you think about what got blown up in the Pentagon the day before,

634
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:43.200
nine one one Donald Rumsfeld,
you can go,
goes on.
Yeah.
He goes,

635
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.570
he goes in front of the Jesse Ventura.
She,
yeah,
it's a,

636
00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:49.350
you can also see on Youtube,
Donald Rumsfeld,
the day before nine one one,

637
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.910
he has a press conference explaining how we just found out that the,
uh,

638
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.680
the enemy is within the,

639
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.380
somewhere in the Pentagon we have the enemy and we're going to find out,

640
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.110
it turns out were two point $3 trillion,

641
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.330
a two point $3 trillion a missing from the Pentagon.
So we need a,

642
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.440
that's what they just figured out in accounting.

643
00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:09.300
That's what he's just talking about the day before.

644
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.360
Next Day fucking nine one one goes down,

645
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.910
a missile blows up the accounting office and all the accountants will,

646
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:21.910
there's photos,
Brian.
Sure.
It's CIS.

647
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.180
If this was a CR,
that cy episode,
you would definitely look at that.
Right?

648
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:30.840
You know,
that's some fishy shit.
That is Brian,
do me a favor and pull up that,
uh,

649
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.230
Jesse Ventura conspiracy theory thing.
It's on youtube.

650
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.440
Go to youtube and write a Jesse Ventura conspiracy Pentagon did.

651
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.440
They blew up the accounting office and the account and stayed.

652
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.870
The ones that just figuring out that we were,
that they,
whatever they did,

653
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:52.890
they swindled two point $3 trillion.
Yeah.
Jessie,

654
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.530
this Torah conspiracy theory,

655
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.680
Donald Rumsfeld,

656
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:07.240
I want to know how they steal it.
Pentagon?
Yeah.
When,

657
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.080
let me see if this is the one.

658
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.063
<v 4>Okay.</v>

659
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.730
<v 1>This was a c so when you put all that melted together and I can put all that</v>

660
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:20.690
shit together.
Fuck you guys up to,
that's up to no good here.

661
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.270
I've been governor a navy seal

662
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.770
or we don't have to hear this part.

663
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.950
I just like hearing how I think it's time you get the story.

664
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.800
<v 5>Is this the</v>

665
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.830
<v 0>clip we're looking for?
Is this the whole episode though?
Not,
I don't know.</v>

666
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.100
Oh yeah,
that's fine.
Is the whole episode.
Dude,

667
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.530
we can't do this and what are you looking for?

668
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.600
I just want the one Donald Rumsfeld quote.
Oh yeah,

669
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.820
just go put Donald Rumsfeld.

670
00:38:52.821 --> 00:38:55.250
Nine 10 oh one

671
00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.320
put that shit on.
Let's listen to that.

672
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.150
What do you got to say about that next day?

673
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.840
The only part of the Pentagon that's blown up as the accounting office brunch.

674
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:10.580
Just try to find that shit.
I don't know.
It's,
I know.
It's um,

675
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.530
it's Donald Donald Rumsfeld.

676
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:17.620
DDS might be at six minutes long now.
No,
that's,

677
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.580
I know you'd have to secretariat.

678
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:21.841
<v 5>Yes.</v>

679
00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:26.841
A press conference where he reports that they have simply lost tooth point $3

680
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.450
trillion.
They don't have receipts for it.
They don't know where it went.

681
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.870
Do you recall that the day before nine 11?
Well,
if you don't,

682
00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:36.600
that's what happened.
According to some estimates,

683
00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:40.650
we cannot track two point $3 trillion in transactions.

684
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:46.020
I got the exact place that was struck in the Pentagon,

685
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.260
which were all those records were supposedly had to be now all destroy show,

686
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.000
I guess the two point 3 trillion.
We as taxpayers just say,
say,
let me,

687
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.400
isn't that a bit much?
Did he just punch it?

688
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.840
All the [inaudible] been confiscated putting national security and we're not

689
00:40:09.151 --> 00:40:13.100
allowed to view the plane hitting the Pentagon and don't come back with me.

690
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.580
But they did.
You saw that little flash,
a five frame,

691
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.790
three Warren Commission.

692
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.420
The government has a tremendous propensity for secrecy and the Defense

693
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.820
Department and others do as well.

694
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.660
You believe that the lawyer admits our government still hiding the truth from

695
00:40:42.121 --> 00:40:46.880
you and me.
There was no rubble outside,
but there was all,

696
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:51.890
there was was a whole what happened to where the wind shear that question to our

697
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:57.801
nine 11 commission staffer who was the only survivor from that room who made it

698
00:40:58.141 --> 00:40:58.974
out.

699
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:04.010
I did talk to April Gallop who was actually inside the room in the Pentagon and

700
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:10.430
she looked me in the eye and told me unequivocally I saw nothing that indicated

701
00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:12.360
a plane hit the Pentagon.

702
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.960
I felt that bomb had exploded

703
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.010
cause always have different versions of different things.

704
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.580
Well that's a ridiculous statement.

705
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.473
<v 0>Hold on.</v>

706
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.720
A lot of questions that indicate that of course you would feel like a bomb hit

707
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:33.560
it right.
If any kind of I,
I mean it really is a bomb.

708
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.251
What does a bomb?

709
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:37.340
It's an explosion and that's what fucking happens when a plane flies into a

710
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:40.440
fucking building that isn't explored was like watching Steven Seagal rabies.

711
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.100
You saw it.
You saw the footage of the mind frame that they released.

712
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:47.240
There's no plane.
That chick,
you put it all together.
It's so hard to see what it,

713
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:50.300
that is so hard to see what that is,
which is why they released it.

714
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.030
But there's photos off man.
Come on.
Weird.
They're playing.
That's ridiculous.

715
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.120
Weird that a plane,
you know they've,

716
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.510
they've had people like trying to emulate that,

717
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.400
that physical force of like pulling a plane into those g's and they haven't been

718
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:06.770
able to do it.
Just if you put it all together,

719
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:09.890
Donald Rumsfeld talking about the day before we're talking about the,

720
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.820
they just figured out their two point $3 million is missing and then they blow

721
00:42:13.821 --> 00:42:18.440
it up.
Come on Brian.
Do that favor.
Do me a favor and pull this up.
Pull up.

722
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.240
What was the exact freeze and it was uh oh,

723
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:26.990
a flight simulator flight simulator.

724
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.550
Nine one one Pentagon fail.
Yeah.

725
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.850
The guy that keeps trying it over and over again in a flight simulator and he

726
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:38.360
can't get it to work hard.
It's just too hard.
He can't get it.
He can't do it.

727
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.030
They have expert pilots trying to do it.
They can't do it.

728
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:45.610
It's something was flying like inches off the ground.
What is it?

729
00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.450
Well,
you know,
the other thing is would if,
uh,
you know,
whatever it hit,

730
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.160
what if it was under remote control?
Would,
if there was a way to do it manually,

731
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.340
like with,
uh,
a remote control that a,

732
00:42:57.341 --> 00:43:01.850
a person physically couldn't do flying a plane for person physically couldn't

733
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:06.140
control it.
Yeah,
that's what they're saying.
That's the reasoning.
Why much shit,

734
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:10.220
dude.
They're just,
and then there's other layers to that,
that norad,

735
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:12.140
they just ignored all that shit for.

736
00:43:12.141 --> 00:43:15.230
Like they had a stand down pushing so much shit there.

737
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:18.440
You could do three hours on it.
It's all a big fuck up.

738
00:43:18.441 --> 00:43:19.710
They fucked up and you knew they,

739
00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:23.550
they knew they could fuck up and they knew no one was going to stop it.
It could,

740
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.680
it could be mass and competence to mixed in with some fuckery.

741
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.900
It could be a little bit of both.
You know what I'm saying?

742
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.910
Like it could be some fuckery mixed with just real government in compounds can

743
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:37.820
act called the bullshit liberties.
It was all bullshit.

744
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:42.320
Weapons of mass destruction,
all that.
They're on TV in front of the world,

745
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.250
lying their ass off and they know they can get away with it.
And George W.

746
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.310
Bush and Obama,
they're all in the same fucking bad man.

747
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:51.650
They're all just lie on their asses up.

748
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:54.530
Obama is the biggest fucking liar out there.
That guy,

749
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.580
just foolish shit had when he was running for the,
for the presidency,

750
00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:03.110
he had posters of Shaked Guevara in his office and Oh man,

751
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:06.160
he fooled me right there.
I'm like,
damn,
the guy's a shake of RF at night.

752
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.290
That's a fucking revolution.
Meanwhile,

753
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.320
he's been one of the worst people we've ever had as far as like taking away

754
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:15.260
civil liberties.
I mean,
credit's not a melodramatic statement,

755
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:15.831
Ladies and gentlemen.

756
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.000
If you look up the National Defense Authorization Act and look up this new one

757
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:24.440
that makes it illegal,
it's a felony to protest near a secret service agent.

758
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:29.210
Holy Shit.
Obama was for full protest.
He fucking signed it,

759
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:33.070
man.
Peaceful protest about all that.
We talk in the beginning,
Oh,

760
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:37.080
if I'm president,
I'm going to push for legalization,
pop,
pop,
pop,

761
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.760
the whole weed,
the whole weed community,
the whole culture,
the whole business.

762
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.320
They were all behind Obama.

763
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.280
They thought Obama was going to be the one to push it through,

764
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.210
make it legal across the board,
legal,
adult use.
You know,

765
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.080
they got behind Obama.
There were fighting for him,
the whole wheat,

766
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.040
and then he turned his back,
you know,
but it was all planned anyways.

767
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:02.430
It wasn't like he just like,
he all of a sudden he became just an evil.

768
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.660
Fuck he's that's been planned.
This is all planned.
This is all bullshit.

769
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:08.790
They're slowly taken away our freedoms,

770
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.780
day by day increments in increments,

771
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.920
and we're all just sitting there watching it fucking go and no one's even paying

772
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:20.700
attention.
Really amazing.
This is all you need to know.
Ladies and gentlemen,

773
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.080
really just put this into your head.

774
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.140
Anybody that's trying to take away your right to peacefully protest is not your

775
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:30.090
friend.
They're not looking out for you.

776
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.360
They don't want you to be able to talk about the shit job they're doing.

777
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:36.530
They want it to all just sink in like the evening news,

778
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.140
the big fucking stupid smile on their face.
That's not good.

779
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.170
There's no way to rationalize it.
It's not American.

780
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:47.000
It's against the constitution.
But does it surprise you?
No.

781
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.610
Does it all?
Look man,
I've been watching this game of Thrones.

782
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.920
You ever watch that show?
No.
Oh Dude,

783
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:55.620
I'm hardcore dictum among the like five episodes in,

784
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:58.140
but one thought about hardcore addicted.
It's all like,

785
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.490
it's based on this fantasy land,
this a middle,

786
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:03.930
a middle earth.

787
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.960
You know like there were like winter is like fucking 10 years long and summer's

788
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:14.280
like nine years long and there's dragons and,
but the,
the,

789
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:14.680
my,
my,

790
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.680
my point was these motherfuckers are just constantly trying to jack each other

791
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:24.270
to get better positions to constantly worrying about being jacked by some other

792
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:25.620
people coming over the hill.

793
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.370
They're constantly worried about getting fucked up by the dude's from the north

794
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.330
who want back their land.
It's just,
and you realize that's,
this is just like,

795
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:35.640
there's no difference between now and then.

796
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.900
I mean we're not used to seeing dudes sword fight in the street like they were

797
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:42.960
back then,
but there's not that much difference between now and then.

798
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.800
It's all just done through different machinery in different language and

799
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:49.710
different methodologies and then you know,

800
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.600
different governments working together to do it and doing as nonviolently as

801
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:56.280
possible.
But when the shit hits the fan,

802
00:46:56.281 --> 00:47:00.540
the boys hit the shore guns and hand fucking tanks rolling over the ground

803
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.540
because somehow or another there's some shit going down in Afghanistan that were

804
00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:05.610
really,
it's really important that we're there to stop it.

805
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.350
We've got to stop Afghanistan.
W what?
What,
what?
I mean it's so transparent,

806
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:12.510
so clean.
Like there's really,

807
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:16.500
there's really no room for it to be anything other than what it is.
It's like,

808
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.520
oop.
There you go.

809
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:22.740
Do you think it's ridiculous war what were were going to attack North Korea

810
00:47:22.861 --> 00:47:26.040
soon?
No.
You don't think so?
No.
I think North Korea needs,

811
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.310
they need food man there,
those people can't even get their rockets launched.

812
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:34.480
They launched a couple of failed a couple of different rocket launches I think

813
00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:38.380
we're going to work against and very soon in fact been hearing a lot of people

814
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.890
being called to shore are calling.
Did Daddy really?
Yeah.

815
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.690
A lot of people like it's weird.
Really?
Where have you been hearing this?

816
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:51.160
Maybe I just made it up.
Am I allowed to talk about that?

817
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.270
Probably not,
right?
I don't know.
I don't know man.

818
00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.040
That's some dark shit when he know somebody who's about to get called up like

819
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:00.310
people.

820
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.600
There's somebody I know that's like 45 and like he's been out for awhile and

821
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.180
they called him back at St starship troopers.
Man.

822
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.130
It's not like the bugs are coming.
We've got to fight them off.
Okay.

823
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.290
This is other people.

824
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.040
There's other people on the other side of the world rocking it however the fuck

825
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.850
they do and for whatever reason we've got to go in and interject and fuck with

826
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:22.690
their way of life and fuck with their existence.
It's crazy.
It's really crazy.

827
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:26.800
That's not what are patriotic Americans that are serving because they really

828
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:28.780
want to help this country.
That's not what they deserve.

829
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:31.540
What they deserve is to be involved in just wars.

830
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:36.130
Only what they deserve is to be at home and and it to be,
you know,

831
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.180
with their fucking families and not have to use our resources to keep them over

832
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:44.050
in some spa where they don't fucking need to be.
It's nonsense.

833
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:48.700
You're not going to fix Afghanistan.
You're out of your fucking mind fit.

834
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:51.790
That place is crazy.
It's all,
it's,
there's one city,

835
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.830
Kabul and warlords everywhere.
It's like they're like mountains and shit.

836
00:48:56.831 --> 00:49:00.970
You,
you ever see the videos of like the,
the troops spring back like shit,

837
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:05.590
like home movies,
the mountains of Afghanistan like God damn,
that is crazy.

838
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.040
They're like in some nutty Lord of the rings movie over there.

839
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.470
Nobody's fixing Afghanistan.
Get out of there.
It's just another Vietnam.

840
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.030
It's another thing that we're going to regret.

841
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.970
It's that the sooner they get out of there,
the better.
But they never will.

842
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.700
They never will because they're in it for the money and that's why it's so

843
00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:23.080
transparent.
That's what that scene do.

844
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:27.580
You really think that anybody high up with the real greenlight power thinks that

845
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:30.480
they're trying to help Afghanistan?
I think there's,
you know,

846
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.610
money is the bottom line like heroin,
the oil,

847
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.030
all that kind of shit that's all involved.
They do help and that,
that helped.

848
00:49:37.031 --> 00:49:40.120
They use to justify what they're doing over there.
I mean they can do that.

849
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.020
I think eventually a rack will be in a better position.
I don't know.
Well,

850
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:46.600
you know what?
I don't even say that now because we left.
Right?

851
00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.210
The United States is officially like leaving Iraq.

852
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:52.090
It's only going to be like a few thousand soldiers or something there.

853
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.050
Isn't that the case?
That's right.

854
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.100
And I think the only reason those people are there is because we bought all that

855
00:49:57.101 --> 00:50:01.420
property from,
you know,
we bought property then.
Isn't that hilarious?

856
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:04.840
And we could even say that.
That can't be true.
Right?
We buy it.
Yeah.

857
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:05.431
We always bite.

858
00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:08.170
We always go into countries and buy properties and buy properties and put up a

859
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:12.160
bass.
Boom.
What a nutty country we are.

860
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.840
It's fascinating times,
man.
It's fascinating times.

861
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.680
There's going to have to be some sort of a fucking mass awakening though.

862
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:24.820
There's no way we can keep up this ridiculous psychotic pace with all the access

863
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:28.280
to information that we have.
The only way we're to get there.

864
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.210
<v 6>As we got to get into question mode,
started questioning everything.
Don't accept.</v>

865
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.470
Look into it.
Even if it turns out to be totally benign,
look into it.

866
00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:40.400
There's some stuck in fishy shit going on.
Yeah,
but resources to look into it.

867
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.250
Questions,
Shit.
Don't just accept,
should,
don't think.

868
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.860
Don't think that your government is out for your best interest.

869
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:50.510
It's not that way that way at all.
Politicians are just at the high levels.

870
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.330
They're just getting theirs and they don't care who's in their way.

871
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.490
The real problem,
those resources.

872
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:57.830
The real problem is there's a lot of people out there that don't have any

873
00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:01.070
fucking opportunity for employment.
This is fucking not much,
man.

874
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.130
And the United States army,
marines,
air force,
what have you,

875
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:08.380
is the best career option for them and then that's legit.
That's legitimate.

876
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.090
A lot of parts of this country,
man and some parts of this country,
we're dudes.

877
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.620
We're trying to find a way out,
you know,

878
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.400
and when the marines come along and offer you guidance and discipline in a way

879
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:19.160
to pay for college,
you know,
for a lot of dudes that that's helped them.

880
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.760
That's helped.

881
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.760
I know a lot of people that it's changed him for the better till they use u two

882
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:27.260
wars break out.

883
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.470
Cause I remember dudes when dudes joined the marines when there was no war.

884
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.080
That's a,
that was a different sort of experience.

885
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:36.380
That was a guy with joined the marines to toughen up.
But once,

886
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.450
once war started happening,
man,

887
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:43.040
that's a completely different gig because now you're actually going to go and

888
00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:47.780
you're going to be involved in some insane one on one combat where you shooting

889
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.990
guns at each other.
You know,
I mean that's more than likely going to happen.

890
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.090
Imagine that.

891
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:58.970
So few resources that that's a viable career option for a lot of people.

892
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.660
But it is,
you know,
we were lucky.
It's not us,

893
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.590
but it is for some folks and then that fucking sucks.

894
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.930
And I think a lot of that is because so much shit gets made in other countries

895
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:12.590
now.

896
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.300
There's not the nearly the manufacturing base that America wants had,

897
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:19.880
especially with like cars and shit.
You know,

898
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:23.180
we used to have like the dopest cars in the world,
you know,
America had like,

899
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.691
you know,

900
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:28.691
back in the day when you know GM and Ford would like do battle to have like the

901
00:52:29.961 --> 00:52:34.940
coolest cars where like mustangs and Camaro's we made some cool ass shit.

902
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.020
But slowly but surely that just fucking fell apart.

903
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.710
Slowly but surely that just crumbled and tumbled.

904
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:47.720
Did you ever see Roger and me now,
Michael Moore movie about Flint,
Michigan?
No.

905
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:51.920
GM closes a plant in Flint,
Michigan.
Dude is dark.

906
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.830
It's a dark fucking movie.
It's brilliant.

907
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.910
And it's all about Michael Moore trying to find out,

908
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.440
like he tries to get an interview with this guy who was the head of GM and find

909
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:06.770
out why he did that and see what he did to this town when he pulled out.

910
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:08.880
I don't know if he didn't,
if he lied to them or some,

911
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:10.850
something happened and these people just were totally,

912
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:14.030
completely unprepared for this.
And he said just simply abandoned it.

913
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.150
And the whole town is like,
it's,

914
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:18.660
it's just crazy to watch how poor people were mad.

915
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.680
People were selling bunnies for food or pets and like,

916
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:27.120
you know,
so you would say food and the lady like grabs the bunny.

917
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:28.800
Like she's got this Bonnie in her,
in our lab,

918
00:53:28.801 --> 00:53:32.520
but just patent it and you say food and she grabs a bunny by the fucking back of

919
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:36.330
the head,
breaks its neck and then just cuts it open.
Right,
right on camera.

920
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:38.730
And she's doing this,
you know,
it's like,
wow,
this is in the movie.

921
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.650
I couldn't walk.
I know you couldn't.

922
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:42.360
That's why I'm telling you about it right now.
How is the,

923
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.300
cause I know you're in love with bunnies.
I mean it's,
you know,

924
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:48.360
how lovable bunnies are.
So this lady is touching this bunny.

925
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.390
And then when you know,
when they say food or pets,
she did see,
you know,

926
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.820
since food.
So she kills it.
When,
when you think about that,

927
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.070
that life gets that hard where you have this cute little bunny and you're like,

928
00:53:59.071 --> 00:53:59.470
all right,

929
00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.850
snapping it's snack time to eat it and now that's like you're getting down.

930
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:05.280
That's an animalistic sort of a vibe you're getting into.

931
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.580
You're getting into this weird,
you know,
that's a,
that's a,

932
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:12.330
that's a weird world you're living in,
man.
You're,
you're eating your pets.
I mean,

933
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.480
that thing is,
you know,
that's dark.
There's one thing to separate.

934
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:18.180
We separate like the chickens are outside and I'm going to eat those chickens.

935
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.300
My Dog,
I'm not going to eat my dog.
You know,
there's one thing,
but when you,

936
00:54:21.301 --> 00:54:25.410
when you're eating your dog too,
that's,
you've gone into the dark zone,
you know,

937
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:30.270
you've,
you've,
you've gone into this weird desperation mode.
You're eating pets.

938
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.660
Don't read of mice and men either MD.
Yeah.

939
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.940
There's a lot of that to George is not good with the robins.
Right.

940
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:40.400
I want to do as Hobos off the dogs.
You know what I mean?
Like,
Oh yeah,

941
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.190
sure they do brother.
I'm sure they do,
right?
No doubt,
man.
No doubt.
Yeah,

942
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:47.760
they eat dogs.
Did you hear about a,
we were in Florida this weekend.

943
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.660
Fort Lauderdale.
I mean Dunkin had a great fucking time.
Awesome crowds.
Thank you.

944
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:55.740
Everybody who came out,
we had a fucking blast.
Um,
but when we were down there,

945
00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.800
a dog had gotten eaten in the Florida keys recently by a crocodile.

946
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.090
A crocodile took a 65 pound Labrador.

947
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:11.210
It flew four feet out of the water and snatched it off of like a wall.

948
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.980
They're probably happens on,
my dog was barking.
There's dogs bark.

949
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.700
I don't know man.
I don't think,
I think this is pretty rare.
It's a big dog.
See,

950
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:24.750
crocodiles are so much more dangerous.
They go after shit.

951
00:55:24.751 --> 00:55:29.070
That's what people don't understand.
Like in Florida,
like when,
when I was a kid,

952
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:34.071
I lived in Gainesville and we would feed the alligators marshmallows and shit

953
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.880
and they would like ask you to please don't feed the alligators.

954
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:41.340
Marshmallows cause marshmallows getting their digestive tract.

955
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.280
Meanwhile these alligators would kill people's dogs.

956
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:48.090
They're like would kill like old ladies dogs.
I was there when it happened once.

957
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.680
It was like either it happened like right before we were there or right after we

958
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.101
were there.

959
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:56.250
But like my parents were really freaked out that an alligator eight fucking

960
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:57.120
lady's dog,

961
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:01.200
like she was walking along by the water and the thing just came out and snatch a

962
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:06.180
dog from her.
But crocodiles will chase people,
crocodiles will chase you.

963
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.360
They go after shit.
They're way more aggressive.

964
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:10.980
It's a completely different animal.

965
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:15.000
Alligators sit and they'll just sit and wait for something to fuck up so that,

966
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:17.910
that dog must have fucked up.
That dog just got too close.

967
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:22.290
But crocodile chase how fucking dog and might just jack the Old Lady,

968
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.070
you know they people no

969
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.180
<v 2>problem.
And this one flew four feet in the air to kill a dog.</v>

970
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.930
It's amazing that people would want to keep those around like they like you

971
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:36.100
can't even shoot them.
They have to,
they're protected.
What you,

972
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.800
you don't think that's dangerous when don't you guys have kids?

973
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.360
You want to keep this fucking still,

974
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:44.170
it's not like crocodiles are gonna go extinct.
If you want them,
go to Africa,

975
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.290
go fucking go look at them real quick and then come back home.
But let's,

976
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.960
let's kill all the crocodiles we have here.
He crazy.

977
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:52.210
Let's make belts out of those bitches.

978
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:57.750
Fuck Crocodiles Ecos you talking about we are fucking up the Florida ecosystem

979
00:57:00.371 --> 00:57:02.880
though.
They got a real problem man with python.

980
00:57:02.881 --> 00:57:07.881
So those stupid fucks release pythons and they get too big and then the fucking

981
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:12.730
everglades is like infested with giant pythons.
Dude.

982
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:16.010
We flew over the everglades and when we landed it was early in the morning.
Not,

983
00:57:16.011 --> 00:57:19.950
not really,
you know,
like nine,
9:00 AM.
And as we're flying in,
um,

984
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:22.960
like looking out like how over the window,
it's beautiful,

985
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.560
but the fucking everglades are you,

986
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.230
it's just all swamp.

987
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:34.360
Like a big part of Florida is all just like water and trees growing out of the

988
00:57:34.361 --> 00:57:37.960
water and fucking giant snakes,

989
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.670
giant 20 foot long pythons that are eaten alligators,

990
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.040
they're so big,
they're eating alligators.

991
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:49.630
There's a photo of a fucking python with an algae to burst out of it's stomach.

992
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.830
That's how basically the everglades or like the Amazon,

993
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.490
well it's kind of scarier than the Amazon cause it's almost all water.

994
00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.970
Like a lot of it is water.
It's like where we were flying over,

995
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:05.500
it's like swampy and it's almost creepier than the Amazon cause like,

996
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.780
I don't know man.
They're both fucked up.

997
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:11.080
I guess the Amazon probably has more poisonous shit.
Would you go to the Amazon?

998
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:12.820
I'll go to the everglades before I'd go to that.

999
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:15.340
Cause I know a lot of the good old boys from Florida,

1000
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:18.160
they'll fuck around and the everglades,
they get those boats with the,
uh,

1001
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.370
like the fan behind it and they fish in the everglades.

1002
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:26.790
I'm totally fascinated with looking at Amazon DVDs and documentaries about the

1003
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:27.221
Amazon,

1004
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:32.200
but I have no desire to ever go like swimming the rivers and shit like that.

1005
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.730
I'm so not a jungle guy.

1006
00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.990
You remember when I first got this house and we sat in that I got to look a

1007
00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:39.760
little theater room and we watched that.

1008
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:44.680
The documentaries from the BBC on the Amazon where you see that fucking crazy

1009
00:58:44.681 --> 00:58:47.990
bird eat that like ancient customer fish out of the Congo.

1010
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.360
We talked about this before.
Yeah,

1011
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:52.750
I mean remember what an impact that video had on you.

1012
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.650
We just think about how ridiculous it would be to go to any sort of a rain

1013
00:58:56.651 --> 00:58:57.790
forest,
Congo,

1014
00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:02.110
the Amazon just to be dropped off in that shit and the Congo is the craziest.

1015
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.090
Definitely people live in the Amazon.

1016
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:07.070
I don't think there's a whole lot of people living in the everglades.
Well,

1017
00:59:07.071 --> 00:59:10.600
I think there's probably like some parts of the everglades we could drive to and

1018
00:59:10.601 --> 00:59:11.410
live in,

1019
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.060
but it looked to me like there was a lot of it that will look like pretty God

1020
00:59:14.061 --> 00:59:17.440
damn wild.
Everyone just talking out of my ass.
Maybe people are just,

1021
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.930
I think people,
there's a lot of people that live around there.

1022
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.010
Isn't there a show like on swampy?
Yeah,

1023
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.130
<v 6>something like that.
People kept wanting to get me to go there though.</v>

1024
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:26.690
A lot of people I met were like,
dude,

1025
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:30.010
you gotta come out of the fucking everglades with his man when?

1026
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.230
When we party out there,
do we need some fucking mushrooms?

1027
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:37.550
What's scary is people that live in deserts,
hilarious party in Florida.
Dude,

1028
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.150
Florida parties hard.
They fucking party hard.

1029
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:44.930
Those were the wild crowds.
I told him,
and this is true,

1030
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:48.410
there's like the perfect crowd to get me ready for next week or for this week

1031
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:51.230
now.
What'd you just modern now?
Yeah,

1032
00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:55.850
just did the Improv and Fort Lauderdale and just fuck it was fun,
man.

1033
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:59.510
Great crowds,
but they're so wild.
It's crazy,
man.

1034
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.370
It's like two out of three shows.
A girl would stand up and say some crazy shit.

1035
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:10.310
It was.
It was a bunch of like really wild heckler experiences,
but they're fun.

1036
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:13.610
They're really nice people,
man.
It was a good time.
Good God damn time.

1037
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.670
But they live in a tropical country,
man,
Florida.

1038
01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:20.240
That's a goddamn tropical country.
South Florida,
you know this key.

1039
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:23.330
This is the keys where the dog had eaten by the crocodile.

1040
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.750
That's really like a tropical country.
I mean that's like,
those are like,

1041
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:30.290
you got to drive to them over like a bridge,
you know,
those are,
that's a,

1042
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.480
that's a,
that's not even really connected.

1043
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.590
<v 7>I just got back from the desert and it was really weird singing about the people</v>

1044
01:00:37.591 --> 01:00:41.670
that lived in the desert,
like the roads were not mean maintained.

1045
01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:45.600
So you just go through these like dirt roads and it looked like every single

1046
01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.520
person that's a hoarder.
Uh,

1047
01:00:47.521 --> 01:00:50.100
the rich hoarders get to come out here because that's,

1048
01:00:50.101 --> 01:00:53.130
every house seemed like a hoarder house from just the outside.

1049
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:56.870
And there was parts where I,
I couldn't go cause there was like these dogs,

1050
01:00:56.871 --> 01:01:00.090
I would come into the street and like block you and they just wouldn't leave.

1051
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.940
Like you couldn't drive through them.
It was fucking weird.
Man.

1052
01:01:02.941 --> 01:01:07.350
That desert is weird.
Well,
part of the desert.
You're talking about a Joshua tree.

1053
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.020
Yeah,
but Dunkin's always trying to get me to go to Joshua tree.
There's this is,

1054
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.900
you might be trying to rain man.
Yeah,
he might be.

1055
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:16.620
But actually there's this place that we uh,
went to that was really,

1056
01:01:16.621 --> 01:01:20.910
really cool nurse like these 12 aero stream trailers and each one of these

1057
01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:23.340
trailers are,
have been remodeled and gut it out.

1058
01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:27.210
Like I stayed in the seventies one of my friends stayed in the like one that was

1059
01:01:27.211 --> 01:01:31.260
like all like eighties 80 like 1980s type shit.

1060
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.000
And they have a,
you know,

1061
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:36.930
archery shooting guns and they have one of those big tps where you go in there

1062
01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:41.190
and do drugs and stuff.
And like even on the book it's like people are like,

1063
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.740
you know,
how did they sign?
Like,
hey had a great time.
You know,

1064
01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:47.250
they have like a book that you can sign and every one of these trailers.

1065
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.220
And everyone was like,
dude had the best shroom trip ever.

1066
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.130
Like I'm tripping my ass off right now.
This is what my mom looks like.

1067
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.360
They just drawing pictures and the whole place seemed bad ass.
And I thought,

1068
01:01:57.361 --> 01:02:00.960
how cool would it be to rent out every single one of these trailers and just

1069
01:02:00.961 --> 01:02:04.690
have like a big party with all your friends because that's what it was.

1070
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.820
It was designed for you just to go there and experience psychedelics and just,

1071
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.980
it was Josh,
which it was designed for that,
that,

1072
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:16.470
this place to say that there's a lot of that up there.
Right.
It's so amazing.

1073
01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.030
There's so many different places like that,

1074
01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:22.470
but I heard of it and I used to go to Joshua tree as a kid all the time with the

1075
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:27.030
boy scouts.
Used to go all the time.
Yeah.
And,
but never on money.

1076
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:29.470
Let you,
uh,
I brought my dogs.

1077
01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.840
And can you go in that big room and sing?
You can do whatever the fuck you want,

1078
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:37.290
man.
It's,
it's designed for you and eat.
The biggest thing is,

1079
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:40.560
and made me really realize that I could live in one of those arrows streams if I

1080
01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:45.470
want.
I can almost live.
They're like,
those are so nice.
How big they are.

1081
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.950
Do you have internet?
Yeah.
Had Internet.
We had,
we had a hot tub pools,

1082
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:52.700
ping pong table live in something like that.
My,

1083
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.500
my friend Guido that I was talking about earlier and he lives in like a big

1084
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:59.190
mobile mobile home phone,
Internet.
Would you still do it without an internet?

1085
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:00.310
Fuck that.
Okay.

1086
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.750
But that's cool because you can move your wherever you want to live.

1087
01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:07.320
Like I know that Malibu has this really nice place that you can just park your

1088
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:10.990
aero stream in,
like rent the spot per month.
And I forget what,
uh,

1089
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.610
what's his name?
The guy from oh right.
Oh right.
Oh right.

1090
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:19.530
That guy was the girls keep getting younger and I keep on saying the same age.

1091
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:23.760
What's that guy's name?
Matt mcconahey.
Matt mcconaughey.
Matt mcconaughey.

1092
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.780
He rented a place in Malibu where he had his trailers and oh yeah.

1093
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:31.020
Didn't mean like live in a trailer for a while.
Well done movie star.

1094
01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:34.860
I think he still does.
She not,
I don't think so.
Mad He's married now.

1095
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:38.940
He's going to,
he had a little cameo in the season finale of eastbound and down.

1096
01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:41.170
Oh my God.
I saw that his cameo was on,

1097
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:45.670
let's can we talk about the economy killed it.
That was his best prophase.

1098
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.560
Brilliant.
I Saint Matthew Ma Mikaila is great.
Tropic Thunder.
He was great.

1099
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.900
Exactly.
He's creating everything.
He's got this like,
he was great.

1100
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.450
He wasn't in that one way.
Wouldn't it be great to smoke weed with him?

1101
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.140
I was going to say he was great in that dragon movie,

1102
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:05.280
but he wasn't in that dragon movie trouble or he killed.
I was,

1103
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.330
for whatever reason,
I thought he was in that Christian Bale movie about dragons,

1104
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:13.580
but it wasn't
dragging movie.

1105
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:19.770
You don't kill it.
I saw that hunger games,
the hunger games now.

1106
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:22.830
I haven't seen it yet.
Woody Harrelson.
He's a bad motherfucker.
Was it good?

1107
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:27.420
It's not a bad moving.
It's a,
it's,
you know,
it's kind of a,
it's kind of fun.

1108
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.350
You know,
cabin in the woods.
The worst garbage ever way.

1109
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.990
That was good that somebody just told me to see that.
Oh God.

1110
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.590
What's it about?
It's terrible.
What is it about,

1111
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.870
what is it about a cabin in the woods,
right?
Yeah.

1112
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:48.063
Maybe is about it.

1113
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:52.560
Is it like it's way worse than you can imagine.

1114
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.920
Describe it.
Do you want me to tell you about it?
Fuck you.

1115
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:59.970
I don't want to blow it.
Don't
blow.

1116
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:03.210
It really sucked.
You really feel like it's,
it's about,

1117
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.360
it's about some God who has signing actual human scientists working for them to

1118
01:05:11.311 --> 01:05:12.900
sacrifice Virginians.

1119
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:18.110
So the way the scientists get to sacrifice virgins is they,
they

1120
01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 1>got like CIA connections where they,
they,</v>

1121
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:25.710
they somehow coordinate three guys and two girls to take a trip out in the cabin

1122
01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:31.780
in the woods for a weekend and party.
And then while they're out there,

1123
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:35.350
it's all experiment that's all like fenced off electronically.

1124
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:39.040
So the scientists are all programming,
you know,

1125
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.890
they think they're just going out to a cabin,
you know,
swimming in the lake.

1126
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.040
But they're part of an expense,
a sacrifice.

1127
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:50.370
And one of them is a virgin and they decide based on what they do,

1128
01:05:51.311 --> 01:05:55.150
there's like some magic books that they read in the cellar based on what they
re,

1129
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:58.600
they decide how they're going to die.
Are they going to read,

1130
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.290
are they going to have the zombies attack him?
Goes to attack them.

1131
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.710
Girls with no face,
just a mouth attack them.

1132
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.150
There's every giant cobras.
They're all in little boxes.

1133
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.800
Every monster you could think of is in a little box under the lake and they,

1134
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:17.920
based on what they read,
they did based on what they read.

1135
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:21.250
They got the zombies that like a mountain men that were killed and now they're

1136
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:25.300
zombies and they come out with after afterwards with horse traps and an access,

1137
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:29.200
there's like three family and like the scientists are all betting it's a comedy.

1138
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.990
The scientists are all betting.
There's like 20 sides.

1139
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:34.840
They're all betting on how they're going to,

1140
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.260
what monsters are they gonna release based on reading this magic book.

1141
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.790
So you know there's $100 on the zombies.
They got the fucking giant Cobra,

1142
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.300
they got the ghost,
they got the guy with the,
the saw head,

1143
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:47.890
they've got all these,

1144
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:52.540
they're all betting on all these monsters and goblins and ghouls.

1145
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:55.700
Sounds like a movie you actually would like to dump.

1146
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:56.840
Might be my favorite movie ever.

1147
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.420
Just,
they're all working and guests who,

1148
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:07.830
the main director is that th that that communicates with the Gods because they

1149
01:07:07.831 --> 01:07:10.580
want Sigourney weaver.
Yup.

1150
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:15.090
That makes a cameo in the worst movie ever.
It was like,

1151
01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.150
it was like a Las Vegas appearance for something.
You know what I mean?

1152
01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:23.800
Jesus Christ.
Who was the seral celebrity apprentice hall.

1153
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.690
Oh,
that's fun.
How's that possible that they got her?

1154
01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.470
I guess they must've just offered us a mad lute did she had some tax problems?

1155
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.890
I think
she was just an Avatar man.

1156
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.880
You didn't read the scratch.
She's from alien.
You know what?

1157
01:07:38.881 --> 01:07:41.070
They gave her another script.
I think that's one of those.

1158
01:07:41.071 --> 01:07:44.990
Maybe it's that we're going to disagree on like alien.
Fine.

1159
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:50.140
It was just amazing.
Whoa,
whoa.
Hold on.
Wine.
Go Watch it.
It was a comedy.
It was.

1160
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:55.140
It was a comedy.
It was a calm,
and I'm not even joking.
It wasn't,

1161
01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:59.790
comedy was hilarious.
How high were you saw it.
I was,

1162
01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:04.530
I was pretty high.
I had a glass of wine.
You know what I mean?

1163
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.920
I was ready to enjoy this shit.
Right,
right.
It was really you.

1164
01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:12.660
You'd never been one for like fantasy type movies?
It was ridiculous.

1165
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:16.190
I like,
I like a lot of ridiculous movies.
Yeah.
Like I like superhero

1166
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.910
<v 2>movies.
You like she'll be here on my list.
No,
no,
no.</v>

1167
01:08:19.150 --> 01:08:21.860
See if I know the guy's going to live.
I don't want to see this shit.

1168
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:27.740
Every superhero movies the same are seven or eight like moments where he's like

1169
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:31.760
about to die and then he does,
you know he's not going to die.
Yeah,
I know.
I know.

1170
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:34.670
It's a superhero movie that I'm not into that man.
I'm not doing it.

1171
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:37.880
You see the watchman?
Yes I did.

1172
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:41.000
It's a good superhero movie cause it's sort of an anti superhero movie.
Yeah,

1173
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:44.480
that was pretty good.
First Superhero movie.
That was,
I was all right.

1174
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.660
That was pretty out.
I'm just not,
it was a great room.
If there were,

1175
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.900
if they're wearing tights and they got capes and they're flying and shit like

1176
01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:55.670
that,
that's hard for me.
Got Us like,
I don't know.
I know it could really happen,

1177
01:08:55.671 --> 01:08:58.370
but iron man was the shit dude.
He didn't like iron man.

1178
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.060
That was cool because that could really happen.
Okay.
Because he's like a machine.

1179
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:04.230
It's like a machine.
You know what I mean?
They made iron man.

1180
01:09:04.231 --> 01:09:05.950
It was cool cause it was believable to,

1181
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.300
the guy made a nuclear reactor and stuck in his chest.

1182
01:09:08.301 --> 01:09:13.190
That shit ain't real fuck outta here.
Oh,
you're like iron man.

1183
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:16.430
It's totally possible.
Batman's more possible that iron man.

1184
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:21.290
I think iron man is more possible.
Iron man man is a regular human being.

1185
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:24.460
Batman is just a super yoke.
Dude is like that.

1186
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.920
A lifetime ago he would have been today or Lawsky when he was in his prime.

1187
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.770
If Andre Arlovski was in his prime when he was,

1188
01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.360
he could have been a real lot of times.

1189
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:35.000
Was He tied up and then at the last second he gets out

1190
01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.340
Bluefin.
Yeah.

1191
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:43.850
It's much more positive and having a nuclear reactor for a heart and he's

1192
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.820
reaching in and he's having a fucking,
what's her face?

1193
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.780
Gwyneth Paltrow reach in there and pull the wires out.
That's preposterous.

1194
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:54.440
And are they all sign fuck iron man.
I don't give a shit.

1195
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:56.780
I want to know iron man t shirt.
I thought it was I,

1196
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.220
I like Robert Downey jr you wouldn't wear an iron man.

1197
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.250
I have a captain America t shirt.
I'm not into customer.
Correct.

1198
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:06.290
I'm not in the common below.
I'm just don't read them very often man.

1199
01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:07.430
But I'll tell you what,
when I was a kid,

1200
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:11.630
they brought me great joy when I was a kid and I was moving around.

1201
01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:12.950
We're moved around all over the country,

1202
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:16.880
the constant in my life because like when we moved a bunch of times,

1203
01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:18.290
like it takes a while to make friends.

1204
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.470
You're in one place and then you move in two years and you're another place.

1205
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.220
Comic books were like my constant buddy when I was a young kid.

1206
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.830
So to me like I'll always have like a special spot in my heart for comic books.

1207
01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:33.620
Cause I even remember the effect that they had on me when I was a kid.

1208
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.030
And that's undeniable.
Like to say now that I'm over that or that's ridiculous.

1209
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:40.910
No,
they're still cool.
They're still cool.
It's just there's other shit.

1210
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:43.790
It's cooler for me to do with my time.

1211
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:45.800
I really don't have that much time to devote to comic books,

1212
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:49.550
but I still love him.
He did comic book story lately.
No,
but you know I have,

1213
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.000
I really do like watching comics on my iPad.

1214
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:57.260
I'll buy like the marvel comic series on my Ipad,
you know.
And um,

1215
01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.560
there's a there,
there are quite a few that you can you buy.

1216
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.660
You'll be surprised how much you'll freak the fuck out.

1217
01:11:02.661 --> 01:11:05.600
Then if you go inside a comic book store,
I mean tee tee shirt wise,

1218
01:11:05.601 --> 01:11:08.630
toy wise comic,
why you'll go in there.
But holy cow,
look at this teacher.

1219
01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:09.800
Oh look this weird poster.

1220
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:14.280
It's fun though is the way the iPad does it where it's frame by frame.
It's nice.

1221
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.220
<v 6>It's nice because it really is like it's better.</v>

1222
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.950
It's better to read a comic book on an Ipad than it is to,

1223
01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.490
to read it in the actual form because then the actual form,

1224
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.850
you can see all the shit that's going to happen on the next page version and it

1225
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:29.220
really ruins it.
But the IPAD,
it's dope.

1226
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:32.190
Like you don't see explosions come and you don't see anything coming.
It's nice.

1227
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.070
<v 1>The only comics I was into,
tourism or the hustler comics.</v>

1228
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:37.620
I was really at that hospital,
had the best jokes,

1229
01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:41.300
like whoever was writing those jokes.
That was a good quality comic.

1230
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:45.870
That's some funny shit.
Playboy was not as funny,
but hustler had some great shit.

1231
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.010
I would design flyers like the bands I was in,
the speed metal bands I was in.

1232
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.430
My thing was when you give out a flyer for your band,

1233
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:54.720
people just throw it away and go,

1234
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.030
how could I get them to keep it for a little bit?

1235
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:00.780
I would design a flyer on top of a hustler,
a comic,

1236
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.770
so I'm basically giving them a comic and they are looking at like some,

1237
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.900
some dude,
there's one,
there's just one word there.

1238
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:11.640
There's a do a doctor walking in with the check and the doctors telling the

1239
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:13.140
chick,
we did what we could.

1240
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:17.250
It was a really bad accident and they walk into the hospital and there's a dude

1241
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.330
lane there.
It's just a head,

1242
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:23.510
a Dick and a hand that I used that as a flyer ahead of ticking a hand.

1243
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.280
Yeah,
there's a dude lion.
They're in the hospital bed.
He's just the head,

1244
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:29.580
a Dick and a hand.
I thought that was the funniest shit ever.

1245
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.350
And the doctor wanted the doctors walking in,
you know,
with this chick was like,

1246
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.330
it was a horrible accident.
We did what we could.
Oh,
that's funny.

1247
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:42.720
Oh,
come on man.
That was hustling,
Bro.
We're allowed to have different tastes.

1248
01:12:42.721 --> 01:12:46.290
We obviously do.
We're best friends.
We don't even grow real comics.
I never,

1249
01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:50.280
I never got into a man.
I was way,
I was a big kiss fan.
They had kiss comics.

1250
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.680
I didn't read the comics.
I didn't read them.

1251
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:56.810
I don't know why I wasn't into it.
I think,

1252
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.720
<v 6>um,
you're,
you're just don't like obvious heroes.</v>

1253
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.540
<v 1>And,
and I didn't like reading to begin with.
That's a big part of it.</v>

1254
01:13:05.541 --> 01:13:08.600
I didn't read and the only thing I read was magazines,
like rock magazines.

1255
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:12.110
I was totally into that.
Shark books,
dinosaur books,

1256
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.270
<v 6>a lot of books.
And I was a kid.
I wrote a lot.
Those great.
It was,
um,</v>

1257
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:20.210
that's how I got into college books.
I read a lot of shit when I was a kid.

1258
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.400
You know,
like again,
if you don't have that many friends you're read.

1259
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:25.520
And like when I was going to taekwondo for most of my life,

1260
01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.140
I would take the t in Boston,

1261
01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:30.380
so I'd have to walk to the train and take the training and it's like,
you know,

1262
01:13:30.381 --> 01:13:33.110
40 minutes or something like that.
I don't always read,
you know,
read,
get it,

1263
01:13:33.111 --> 01:13:36.650
get a Stephen King Book and when you really,
when you get into a good book,
man,

1264
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:41.780
it's fucking really fun man.
A good Stephen King Book.
God Damn,
they're fun.

1265
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:45.770
I never know.
Oh Dude.
I read half of it and then I was like,

1266
01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:50.330
I can't do it is an amazing book.
God,
that pet cemetery is a fucking great book.

1267
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:54.950
The movie was fun,
but Goddamn that fucking book.
It's good,
it's fun.

1268
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.770
He just knows how to drag you in and it's just entertainment,
man.

1269
01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.880
It's a lot of times.
To me,

1270
01:13:58.881 --> 01:14:01.850
I find it much more enjoyable than watching some terrible moving.

1271
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:05.240
A terrible movie won't engage me at all if it's a great movie.

1272
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.500
I would much rather prefer a great movie than to read a book.

1273
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.980
But a lot of movies aren't movies.
A lot of

1274
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.630
<v 0>movies are an alien,
you know what I mean?</v>

1275
01:14:13.631 --> 01:14:17.020
A lot of movies don't just fucking completely suck you in.
In that case.

1276
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:20.410
Sometimes a book is way better than a shitty movie.
It's a way better experience.

1277
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:22.450
Do you ever read his lot more great books?

1278
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.200
Did you ever read a kings like dark tower or whatever that shits called?

1279
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:31.390
Dunkin raves about that,
but those are daunting dude.

1280
01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:35.080
Those are thousands of pages long.
Like you look at the whole dark tower series.

1281
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:39.250
Stephen King was up bad mother fucker.
You want to talk about it?
Dude?

1282
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:42.880
It's put out a lot of work.
Holy Shit.
Is that guy prolific?

1283
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.790
Who the hell writes more than Stephen King?
I mean,

1284
01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:47.620
that guy's always got a new book coming out.

1285
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.160
He's got another one coming out right now and he's just constantly jams at it

1286
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:55.780
and that he got fucked up by a car.
He got hit by a van.
Yeah,

1287
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:59.350
like bad,
like broke bones all over his body.

1288
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:04.360
Several years ago he got fucked up,
man.
It took a long time to rebuild them.
Many,

1289
01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:07.750
many surgeries.
He's an incredible pain for a long period of time.

1290
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.450
And then they started writing again.
Got Right back into that shit.

1291
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.600
I'd like to say a documentary on that guy,
like his childhood.

1292
01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:16.390
I wonder what it was like growing up.
Well,
he's got a great book.

1293
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.890
It's called Stephen King on writing.
I think it's called was up.
I think that,
um,

1294
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.290
and uh,
it's,
uh,
I think that's it.
Just look,

1295
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.780
look up Stephen King's book on writing if you're interested in it,

1296
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:29.410
but it's a great shows you like how pragmatic is thinking is,
and you know,

1297
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:32.500
he's a very honest about what it was like when he was,
uh,

1298
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.120
doing a lot of drinking and doing a lot of drugs that he would like black out

1299
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:39.130
and not even remember a book that he wrote.

1300
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.610
Like he's talked about several of his books.

1301
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.310
He doesn't remember writing him cause he was just fucked up.

1302
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:50.680
But they're brilliant books.
The Mat Indian in him carry.
That's him.

1303
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:55.390
That's a great fucking book.
Oops.
Mower drive is the best movie back in it.

1304
01:15:56.570 --> 01:16:01.480
We'll just say he's the most famous writer.
He's gotta be one of them.

1305
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.470
He's got to be one of the most famous writers like William Shakespeare.

1306
01:16:05.471 --> 01:16:09.010
Like who else?
Well,
I mean living for sure.
He's one of the most famous living.

1307
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:10.210
Who else would be famous?
I mean,

1308
01:16:10.211 --> 01:16:12.280
you get into people like the woman who wrote Harry Potter.

1309
01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:16.720
She's probably really famous,
but Steve,
I don't know her name fucker.
I know who,

1310
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.180
I know Harry Potter.
I know the name of the movies,

1311
01:16:19.181 --> 01:16:23.020
but I don't know the woman's name is Stephen King.
Like he's crazy fans.
Yeah.

1312
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:24.070
As far as like thing,

1313
01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:28.300
he's probably the most easily recognizable name of a writer.
He's probably,

1314
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:31.510
if I had to say he's my all time favorite fiction writer,
I would say yes.

1315
01:16:31.511 --> 01:16:36.070
I'd say he's number one.
The Michael Jackson,
the shit writing.
He's got so many.

1316
01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:39.700
The Tommy,
Tommy knockers.
Ooh,
I love that one.
That was a great one.

1317
01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:41.830
So fucking long.

1318
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:47.230
A UFO crashed into this area like thousands of years ago and it started this.

1319
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:51.700
Did they dig into it and reactivated or some shit and people get infected by

1320
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:55.600
these Ufo shows and start changing?
I forget the exact plot of it,

1321
01:16:55.601 --> 01:16:59.050
but I remember just one of my favorites when I was a listening and I would like,

1322
01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.060
I'll be bummed out when my stop would come.

1323
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.340
I wonder how he comes up with this shit.
Well He,

1324
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:06.460
I'm sure he smokes a lot of weed because he talks about,

1325
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:10.010
it talks about how great the,
the weed is and Maine and how it should be

1326
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.610
<v 6>a cottage industry and the,
you know,
the weed laws are ridiculous.</v>

1327
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.120
A lot of writers use weed,
you know,
I mean,
we know that,
I mean,

1328
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:20.190
how many writers do we know that are just fiction writers guys are run on

1329
01:17:20.191 --> 01:17:24.200
sitcoms.
Guys who write movie La Writers use weed.

1330
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.840
So of course I'm sure he uses weed.

1331
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.500
<v 7>Jason Ellis has a new book and it's came out today I think.</v>

1332
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:34.850
And he was on some interview earlier and he was talking about like how he's a

1333
01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:39.680
cutter and like he has this new thing where he,
like,
he meets this girl and,
and,

1334
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:42.780
and they cut each other and they just suck each other's blood.
And,

1335
01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.710
and so he was talking about going on this book tour,

1336
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.540
like hitting me like he's like,
he's going to cut himself and then like,

1337
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.120
like stamp,
you know,
instead of signing it,

1338
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:52.850
he's going to start stamping it with this be show crazy.

1339
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.150
That dude is that dude like the whole interview,
I think it was Howard Stern.

1340
01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.600
The whole interview was so fucking creepy.

1341
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.100
I feel bad for that guy.
He's an odd guy.
Whoa.

1342
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:08.120
His Dad's sucked his dick and then you had to suck his dad's Dick was,
yeah,

1343
01:18:08.121 --> 01:18:13.040
when he was like six.
Hello?
Yeah.
No,

1344
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.080
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was all in this interview man and

1345
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.593
Jason Ellis.

1346
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:25.300
<v 6>Damn.
Wow,
that explains wow.
Well No,</v>

1347
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.320
no it doesn't explain cause he's a lot more together then 99.99999999% of the

1348
01:18:31.651 --> 01:18:33.900
world.
Who would have had that same experience happen to them?

1349
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.250
He's very successful guy.

1350
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.970
A lot of people who have had that same experience would probably be wrecked.

1351
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:42.450
And he's sober,
isn't he?
Yeah,
he doesn't drink.
He smokes a little,
well,

1352
01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:45.780
I don't know.
I think he's actually sober.
Yeah.
I now he's completely sober.

1353
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:47.100
I don't know though.
I'd have to,

1354
01:18:47.101 --> 01:18:49.320
I haven't done a show in a while and I'm not upset at that dude.

1355
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:52.560
He drinks some upset at him because he a prank call me once I changed my number

1356
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.760
but I wasn't upset.

1357
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.540
I just automatically change my number of someone that gets it and starts prank

1358
01:18:57.541 --> 01:19:00.040
calling me and I just,
I did it automatically.
I wasn't upset at it.

1359
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.280
I thought it was,
I was like,
oh,
okay.
Whatever.

1360
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:05.760
I didn't think it was like particularly on your number.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1361
01:19:05.761 --> 01:19:06.630
He prank called me.

1362
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:11.280
He's friend called me and said some horrible Boston accent or stuff like that

1363
01:19:11.281 --> 01:19:15.990
and he did it on the air.
It was a good and well,
well cause I like him.

1364
01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:17.570
I would've said it was funny.
If I knew it was him I would,

1365
01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:19.890
I would think it's funny cause I like him but not,

1366
01:19:19.891 --> 01:19:23.370
wasn't that particularly funny?
He does.
You know,
but I didn't,
I didn't get upset.

1367
01:19:23.371 --> 01:19:24.240
I just changed my number.

1368
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:28.080
<v 7>He also talked about going to Amsterdam and getting a hooker and how it was a</v>

1369
01:19:28.081 --> 01:19:32.340
trainee and he started getting something shoved up his ass like a dildo.

1370
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.960
And he was like,
no,
I don't,
I don't want that.

1371
01:19:33.961 --> 01:19:37.230
And it was actually a cock of the tranny.

1372
01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:41.370
He didn't know it was a trainee or Jesus Christ Jesus.
Wow.

1373
01:19:41.371 --> 01:19:45.060
A tranny hooker function in the ass a little bit.
But he didn't want his book.

1374
01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:48.390
The style of like he just told somebody and they wrote it down.
Oh yeah.

1375
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:49.970
And he hasn't even read it yet.

1376
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:54.440
Miss Thailand at 2010 or something like that is a training.
Yeah,

1377
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.800
still louder in de Miss Universe or whatever.
Crazy book has a password.

1378
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:02.630
So Miss World,
what does it mean guys?
Talk about on the podcast writing?
No,

1379
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:06.960
well we showed pictures over man.
It's incredible.
She's really hot.
It's weird.

1380
01:20:06.961 --> 01:20:08.100
I they get the boys

1381
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.210
<v 0>early before they testosterone kicks in and they get them on hormone therapy.</v>

1382
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:14.460
Is that what it is?
Yup.
That's what they do with her.

1383
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.220
I don't know if they did with her,
but apparently this is what I hear.

1384
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.330
I could be totally wrong,

1385
01:20:18.331 --> 01:20:23.331
but in some Asian countries they'll take a a dude and get them on female

1386
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:28.140
hormones quick to make the money back to survive.

1387
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:30.120
Like you're going to be a check now and you're going to be a hooker.

1388
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:35.010
There's one fucking story of these two lesbians that had the son,

1389
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:39.150
I don't know if it was a natural birth son or an adopted son,
I'm not sure.

1390
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.200
But uh,

1391
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.200
they had a son and I believe the kid was 10 and they wanted to get the kid ready

1392
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:47.850
for age,
gender reassignment.

1393
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.330
Cause they said that the boy actually was saying that he was a girl.

1394
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:53.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1395
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:56.880
<v 0>That's probably what they wanted him to wear dresses.
They,
you know,</v>

1396
01:20:56.881 --> 01:20:58.920
he would dress up like a girl and they were like,

1397
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:01.620
he's getting ready to become a girl.
And everybody's like,
Whoa,

1398
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:04.020
you don't see the problem with this.
You don't,

1399
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:09.590
Whoa does this does not give you a gigantic green light here for crazy.

1400
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:12.930
That's,
that's the crazy express is wide open.

1401
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:17.970
This person is saying that a 10 year old once a gender reassignment Jesus

1402
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:22.020
fucking Christ really,
you don't even know none of that is,

1403
01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:25.870
I bet that's just normal.
What is the that Kid's life like?

1404
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:30.010
What is that Kid's environment let to make money?
But I mean,
that's like that,

1405
01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.860
that it's one of those things that you would think that someone would make up on

1406
01:21:33.861 --> 01:21:37.650
like some extreme crazy right wing site because it would make conservative

1407
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:40.560
people so fucking furious.
You know,
the,
the,
the,

1408
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:44.130
this could happen that someone could have,
you know,
uh,
this,
uh,

1409
01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:48.450
this boy and at 10 years old be setting him up for gender reassignment and what

1410
01:21:48.451 --> 01:21:50.440
a fucking travesty that it is and what it does.
Like,

1411
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:54.870
it's almost like an obvious attack on the gender itself.

1412
01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.180
It's like he doesn't want to be this anymore.

1413
01:21:57.181 --> 01:22:01.420
He wants to be another thing like us.
He wants to be like mommy and mommy.
Yeah.

1414
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:02.430
You know?
Whoa.

1415
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:05.250
Could you imagine if you had to stick with the rest of your life with fucking

1416
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:09.630
decisions?
You made it 10.
Holy Fuck Dude.

1417
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:13.260
Being a,
being a transgender is totally normal in Thailand.

1418
01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:17.430
They accept that they're celebrities that are transgenders are transvestites,

1419
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:20.490
whatever you want to call,
it's totally normal.
It's amazing.
Be accepted.

1420
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:25.120
I wonder how that happened.
How crazy is that?
I wonder how that happened now.

1421
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.203
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1422
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:29.860
<v 0>no shit.
Yeah,
someone was a,</v>

1423
01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:33.120
there was an article I think on the underground talking about,
uh,

1424
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:37.200
how lady boys will fuck dudes up if dudes,
you know,
like,
you know,

1425
01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:40.260
some guys get like real disrespectful with lady boys.

1426
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:43.770
They don't realize that that's still a man and still a man and he probably knows

1427
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:48.180
how to punch in a fuck you up man.
Like the stories about them getting upset.

1428
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:49.500
Well,
you know,

1429
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:54.560
you saw a Guy Jujitsu who had the body of a 13 year old Thai girl.

1430
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.330
I could be like,
there's no way you're going to do shit on the fuck you up.

1431
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:00.630
I don't care.
I don't care if you were born with balls.
You know,

1432
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:05.740
they're so frail and tiny.
They are frail and tiny.
But the reality is if you,

1433
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.180
<v 6>if you're like a a girl and you weigh like 130 plus pounds,</v>

1434
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:14.420
there's a few girls that are around that weight that can punch in the face and

1435
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:17.680
knock you unconscious.
Legit.
Like my friend Tommy Jr.

1436
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.090
Did you ever meet my friend Tommy Junior?

1437
01:23:19.091 --> 01:23:21.220
You met my friend Tommy Junior from Connecticut.
He met,

1438
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:23.620
I believe you met him at UFC before.
Anyway,

1439
01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:28.300
his girl has a ridiculously powerful punch.
The ridiculous,
yeah,

1440
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:32.800
ridiculous.
She sets up one of those,
those things like at the bar when you know,

1441
01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:37.150
when you put in a quarter and you fucking smash that punching bag,
dude,
she,
she,

1442
01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.470
she hits harder than guys on that thing.
If she soccer punched you,
you're fucked.

1443
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.580
So if that was a tie check,
if she was,

1444
01:23:43.581 --> 01:23:46.540
it was a tie check that could punch like she punches and you know,

1445
01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:48.100
you thought you were an asshole.
You know,

1446
01:23:48.101 --> 01:23:49.830
you're gonna just going to fucking push her around.

1447
01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.310
You're drunk and she just uncorked one on your chin and your legs give out full

1448
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:57.400
level and pull and then she fucking shame kicks you in the face again.

1449
01:23:57.401 --> 01:24:01.240
That's all real man.
A girl,
135 pound athletic girl.

1450
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:04.210
It's very possible for that check to kick your ass if you don't know what you're

1451
01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:06.970
doing.
That's what I say when you get to,

1452
01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:10.240
when I look at a girl like Tommy Junior's girlfriend,
I say,
okay,

1453
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:11.680
if she wanted to,

1454
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:15.670
if you didn't know what you were doing and she uncorked a couple on you before

1455
01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:18.970
you knew it was happening,
you could get knocked the fuck out for real.

1456
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.020
So that's like,
that's like the size that you have to be,

1457
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:25.870
I think to be able to survive against the average size human,

1458
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:29.780
at least 135 pound woman.
Yeah.

1459
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:32.760
So if you're hunting 10 pounds,
you need to get on roids.
Yeah.

1460
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:38.520
<v 7>Damn cabin in the woods on him for the [inaudible] 92% Oh shit.</v>

1461
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:43.170
I think Eddie,
Eddie Bravo 92 and the guy that on rotten tomatoes.

1462
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.170
Why do I have a feeling this is going to be like my favorite movie of all time

1463
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:47.430
because it sounds awesome.

1464
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.030
And the guy who wrote cabin in the woods is also the director of the new

1465
01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:54.390
adventures.
Maybe so you know,
I might go to go see cabin in the woods tonight.

1466
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:59.640
Well I didn't say the directing was bad.
It was terrible.

1467
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:04.500
Whoever wrote it made that story.
Oh,
he wrote it.
Yeah.
Damn.
I'm sorry.

1468
01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:10.220
I should've lied.
Well listen man,
I know you have very specific tastes.

1469
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.090
Super specific taste when it comes to movies you don't like reading was last

1470
01:25:15.091 --> 01:25:18.510
Werewolf movie you enjoyed.
I'm not done with the world.

1471
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.560
Did you ever see the movie cake liken a underworld thing.
That's,

1472
01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:27.090
that's it's cool to watch because of the colors and stuff and I had to kick ass.

1473
01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:32.130
Kick ass was awesome.
It was great.
I love kicking.
That was a great fucking,

1474
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:35.550
I can't wait for the sequel.
When is that coming out?
Yeah,
that was a,

1475
01:25:35.551 --> 01:25:39.260
that was a great fucking ass.
It's great.
Yeah.
You,

1476
01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.620
you never did you see American Werewolf in London?
Yes,

1477
01:25:43.621 --> 01:25:45.150
but I think I was eight.

1478
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:49.260
The Werewolf was that this convention the other day in Burbank,

1479
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:52.800
the guy played the Werewolf.
Oh,
more convention.
What is his name?

1480
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.800
<v 6>I don't remember.
Yeah,
that dude was in a couple of movies.</v>

1481
01:25:56.801 --> 01:25:58.000
He was like a star for a little bit.

1482
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:00.700
There's dudes like that that become like a star for a little bit.

1483
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:02.070
Who we should respect back

1484
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:04.020
<v 7>to that car.
Cause that's what CACTI.</v>

1485
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:08.023
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1486
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.020
<v 0>Um,
I don't remember his fucking name.
John Land.
David Naughton.
That's his name.</v>

1487
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.960
God.
Damn,
that thing was awesome.
Look at that shit dude.

1488
01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.533
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.920
<v 0>That's cool.
Oh,
that thing's amazing.
What the fuck?</v>

1490
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.250
What a crazy monster that werewolf laws.
Those are just fun movies for me,
man.

1491
01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:33.540
[inaudible] some people they like movies that are sad and realistic where the,

1492
01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:37.910
the good guy dies.
Me,
I'm not really into that.
I just want to be entertained.

1493
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:40.340
I just want you to take me on a trip.
It could be PR.

1494
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.860
<v 1>No one has to die.
I'm not saying make it unpredictable.
Right.</v>

1495
01:26:46.450 --> 01:26:48.080
What's your,
what's your like all time favorite movie?

1496
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:52.100
Do you have an all time favorite?
Gleaming the Cube Bra.

1497
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.180
I mean there's all the classics,
you know,
aliens.

1498
01:26:56.181 --> 01:27:01.130
Part two was one of my all time favorites.
I liked her a lot.

1499
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.480
Did you like the first one,
you know,
in scar face of course and uh,

1500
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:09.050
Goodfellas and Casino and Godfather.

1501
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:14.660
Did you like the first alien?
Yes.
First I liked the second alien better,

1502
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.810
but the first alien was also really good alien three soc.
I didn't like it.

1503
01:27:18.170 --> 01:27:21.260
I didn't mind it.
I didn't mind the through one of the funniest,

1504
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:23.840
most misunderstood movies ever for me.

1505
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.410
And most people thought it was just total shit.
Was Freddy got fingered.

1506
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.910
That's still one of my all time favorites are.
I love that movie man.
Star Wars.

1507
01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:35.150
Did you like fighting off Tinder?
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
Yeah.

1508
01:27:35.151 --> 01:27:37.560
What's your favorite star wars movie?
Which is the,
the,

1509
01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:42.530
the Labor scene when he gave a,
when he had gave birth to that baby,
that was,

1510
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.690
it's the greatest thing ever.
What was your question?
I'm sorry.

1511
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.320
What's your favorite star wars?
Did you like start really into star wars?

1512
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.710
A little bit.
A little bit.
You know,
like empire strikes back.

1513
01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:54.970
That was a classic and Shit.
Yoda.
He was cool.
I'm not like,

1514
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:59.540
like episode one and all that new shit.
They lost me.
You lost me with that.

1515
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:04.320
<v 0>Well,
I think it's funny though,
but I know,
uh,</v>

1516
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.000
I think it has to do with like your,
your past.
Like you don't,

1517
01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.020
you not into like anybody lying to you.
You don't want any bullshit,
man.
You know,

1518
01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:15.600
<v 1>I don't want any holes in the story.</v>

1519
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:19.620
You don't want anybody like about to go over the cliff and digs the hammer into

1520
01:28:19.621 --> 01:28:22.800
the side of the hill and sage theirself dangling over the fucking side of the

1521
01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:27.090
cliff holding onto it.
I love will Ferrell movies like fucking stepbrothers.

1522
01:28:27.091 --> 01:28:29.790
I could watch that over and over,
overstepping me.

1523
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.720
One of the greatest movies ever.
Talladega nights.
Tropic Thunder.

1524
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:37.170
That's probably top three greatest comedies ever,
if not the funniest one.

1525
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:40.920
Tropic Thunder.
Probably the funniest fucking movie all the way through.

1526
01:28:40.921 --> 01:28:44.760
Every character was played an asshole in a movie and they were all brilliant.

1527
01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.220
And uh,
I like that shit.
You know,

1528
01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.540
obviously I'm just not into superheroes stuff.

1529
01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:55.200
Well,
the watchman will be for my son.
You know,
I probably will.

1530
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:58.920
I'll probably get into it and be forced to like lords of the rings and Shit like

1531
01:28:58.921 --> 01:29:02.060
that
dude,
that actually puts me

1532
01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.360
<v 2>to fucking dragons are fine and then the ghost winning the ghost end of</v>

1533
01:29:07.771 --> 01:29:08.604
fighting.

1534
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:13.430
There's just like constant the movies with the constant Braveheart clashing or

1535
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:17.140
they're just like fucking just swinging at each other.
I see.

1536
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:19.080
Braveheart is the only one I could watch like that.

1537
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:22.440
All the other ones forget about it.
There's who fights like that?

1538
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.710
I'd be running the other fucking way.
Just going to come in with fucking swords.

1539
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.070
Fuck that shit.
Grabbed my kids and get the fuck out.

1540
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:31.290
I think that's how they rocked it occasionally.

1541
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:34.620
I don't think they did it that often though.
They did do that crazy.

1542
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:38.670
I think a lot of it was sneaking up on bitches can get a lot of war was back

1543
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:39.504
then.

1544
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:45.330
It's just like you had to convince them.
That was the Jesus man.

1545
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:48.120
You got to convince them you're doing this for Jesus.
You're doing this for God.

1546
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:51.690
Like the Keester doors and all that shit.
Without Jesus,

1547
01:29:51.691 --> 01:29:53.250
they wouldn't have been able to pull that shit really,

1548
01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:56.700
but they were just raping and getting Indian pussy all over the world.

1549
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:59.880
How do you get Indian pussy all over the world?
You have to bring it with you.

1550
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:02.010
They thought they were doing God's mission,
man.

1551
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.420
They thought they were saving them.
Maybe.

1552
01:30:03.421 --> 01:30:05.790
Maybe they were having a good fucking time to that.
That's possible.

1553
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:11.940
Raping and pillaging with swords.
This game of Thrones movie shows,

1554
01:30:11.941 --> 01:30:16.370
so God damn addicted and that's what it's all about.
Everybody just falls short.

1555
01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.050
I heard it's like there's a lot of characters and you just kind of,

1556
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:21.840
there's some points where you're just like,
all right,
there's just too much.

1557
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:26.160
I can't say because I'm only on five episodes,
but as of five episodes,

1558
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.720
there's a couple moments where you got to go,
okay,
that guy's a mad.
The mad king.

1559
01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:33.480
Okay.
And he did that and it was just,
Oh,
okay.
I see what happened there.

1560
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.310
Is this kind of like the tutors also where it's geared towards women and some

1561
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:42.990
weird romantic sex way?
No,
no,
no.
I don't think so.
It's fucking cruel.
Too cruel.

1562
01:30:42.991 --> 01:30:47.010
Show and a lot of titties and a lot of fucking it.
A lot of prostitution,

1563
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:52.440
a lot of betrayal.
Good Times.
Some incest.
It's a crazy fucking show.

1564
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.300
It could not have existed outside HBO.
Oh yeah.

1565
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.910
Hot Brother and sister.
What?

1566
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:03.350
She had illegal back in the day.
No,

1567
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:08.160
it wasn't necessarily normal.
I don't want to give away any spoilers,

1568
01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:09.660
but I figured it out.

1569
01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:14.710
According to mainstream Egyptology Pharaohs would like all their sisters and all

1570
01:31:16.561 --> 01:31:21.561
their relatives where their wives that had hundreds of them according to Egypt,

1571
01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.620
tall,
mainstream,
Egyptology.
That's not it,
but I don't know anything.

1572
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.330
But I think a lot of times royal families,

1573
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:29.340
we're trying to keep their bloodlines pure.
Right?

1574
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:33.410
They were trying to only marry with,
there are some shit to that blood line,
man.

1575
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:35.070
There's,
there's some shit.

1576
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.580
They were fucking their own daughters to that bloodline.

1577
01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:42.810
That bloodline was so important.
They're like,
fuck it.
You're all staying in.

1578
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:44.130
We're going to keep this in the family.
Well,

1579
01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.780
could you imagine the discrepancy too,

1580
01:31:45.781 --> 01:31:49.410
between being a king and being a peasant back then and really there's nothing

1581
01:31:49.411 --> 01:31:52.770
you did earn that position.
You're just royal family.

1582
01:31:52.771 --> 01:31:56.220
You're the son of the son of this fucking guy has been ruling his kingdom

1583
01:31:56.221 --> 01:32:00.790
forever and you just rise.
Yeah,
man,
it's gotta be crazy shit.

1584
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:04.810
We were,
uh,
you know,
just think about what it is,

1585
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:07.630
the difference between the guy who was at the very top and the guy was at the

1586
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:11.640
very bottom and why?
Because he's got royal blood and that's crazy.
There.

1587
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:14.200
I forget the title,
but this woman had the title.

1588
01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:18.190
She was the wife that was in charge of organizing who is going to hang out with

1589
01:32:18.191 --> 01:32:18.551
the feral.

1590
01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:23.290
She was like the event coordinator who's also not that crazy,

1591
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:27.400
ridiculous,
ridiculous.
Damn God.
Damn.

1592
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:32.970
I think the way that people have always rocked it throughout history is there've

1593
01:32:33.241 --> 01:32:37.060
been just wild freak fuck festivals to just people just fuck all over the place.

1594
01:32:37.061 --> 01:32:37.690
Dude have that.

1595
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:40.810
I think that's one of the things is game of Thrones thing is so accurate.

1596
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:44.970
I think people just put people back in those days,
they only lived,
you know,

1597
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.920
they're going to get hacked to death by a fucking guy with a sword that

1598
01:32:47.921 --> 01:32:49.330
someone's going to get them.
They're going to,

1599
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:50.780
someone's going to betray or something.

1600
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.530
They're trying to get the freak on every step of the way.

1601
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:57.850
She's Kama Sutra wild back then,
man.

1602
01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.230
It's amazing when you really think about like the amount of time that went

1603
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:05.500
between then and now.
That's not that much time.

1604
01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:09.430
If you really stop and think about it,
you know?
Well,
ancient religions,

1605
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.700
the ancient Chinese and the the Hindus,

1606
01:33:12.701 --> 01:33:16.540
they all believed that having sex got you closer to God and it was.

1607
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:17.480
That's how you got close.

1608
01:33:17.481 --> 01:33:20.740
It was almost like meditation saw they had back then they didn't have TV.

1609
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.673
That's all they had.

1610
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:26.230
They thought sex brought you closer to God because he didn't have the Internet.

1611
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:29.980
Yeah,
it feels great.
Of course it feels great.
That's the big Trekkie dummy.

1612
01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.170
That's why you make people,
the universe is created.

1613
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:37.070
All your spirituality just went down.
The tubes are like,
fuck that.
I'm like,

1614
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:41.110
are you turn it on and off?
It's funny.
Fuck it.

1615
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:42.550
You're going to crush spirituality,

1616
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:47.650
but you're a spiritual person,
right?
Yeah.
Well,

1617
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:49.270
I'm certainly a nice person for sure.

1618
01:33:49.271 --> 01:33:52.720
Would you consider yourself a spiritual person?
I don't like that word,
but um,

1619
01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.140
because I feel like it has too many weirdo connotations.

1620
01:33:56.141 --> 01:34:01.141
I would definitely say I tried to be a very positive person.

1621
01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:05.050
I try to be really nice to people.
I try,
I go out of my way to do that.

1622
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.420
I go on any kind of spirituality involved in that.
I think there's an,

1623
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:13.150
there's whatever you would want to call it.
There's certainly an exchange in,

1624
01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.370
um,
in,
in energy and in an,

1625
01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:19.720
in an enhancement of each other that I feel like we,
like we all have,

1626
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:24.100
we all have as friends,
you know,
everyone in this room.
I'm Brian.
I for sure.

1627
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:27.970
I mean,
I've known Brian for a decade.
We enhance each other for sure.
I mean,

1628
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:31.110
that's one of the reasons why they call it and I enjoy doing the podcast with

1629
01:34:31.111 --> 01:34:35.800
him.
Man.
I know gay jokes,
Bro.
You and I,
man,
we enhance each other.
You mean for,

1630
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:36.520
you know,

1631
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.150
we've always enjoyed having these crazy conversations even if we don't agree

1632
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:42.370
about a lot of shit and we don't agree about a lot of shit,

1633
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.070
but we've always enjoyed it.
Because I favor,

1634
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:50.310
I favor your opinion over everyone else's and treated equally as if it was mine.

1635
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:52.900
Because I know you so well.
I know how your mind works.

1636
01:34:52.901 --> 01:34:56.950
So every time you have an opinion on something I accepted as if it's me having

1637
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.280
that opinion,
I allow myself

1638
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.510
<v 6>to go through the whole process.</v>

1639
01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:03.320
This is not a whole lot of people that you can do that with in life.
You know?

1640
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:05.030
There's not a whole lot of people where you go,
yeah,

1641
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:08.930
Bob said he didn't do anything,
but it's fucking fingerprints are everywhere.

1642
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:11.840
And the murder weapon was in the street in front of us mind,
you know?

1643
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.900
You know what I mean?
There's few dudes where you,
you,

1644
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.210
you always know where they're coming from.
You know,

1645
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:21.350
and I think having people like that in your life is that it's one of the most

1646
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:22.540
important things.
It's,
it's,

1647
01:35:22.541 --> 01:35:25.880
it's like more important than what you do for a living mo.

1648
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:30.170
The most important thing is you've got to cultivate great friendships because

1649
01:35:30.171 --> 01:35:31.940
then once you cultivate great friendships,

1650
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:37.180
you each get better at everything else while you're involved in a friendship

1651
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:40.190
with someone who's also getting better.
You know,

1652
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:42.440
I think my comedy right now has never,

1653
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:46.400
I've never felt better about it and one of the things that I feel really good

1654
01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:50.600
about it is that I hear Ari is fucking killing it on the road.
I hear already,

1655
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:53.620
like packed it in Vancouver and fucking crush he's got,

1656
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:56.210
he's headlined in all these places that I do.
You know,

1657
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:57.330
like he's headlining big places.

1658
01:35:57.331 --> 01:35:59.110
It's just doing the comedy works in Denver and that's,

1659
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:02.570
I don't care that it's awesome.
I Take Duncan on the road of me,
he goes on stage,

1660
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:05.450
he gets standing ovations.
Dude,
when we were in Louisville,

1661
01:36:05.451 --> 01:36:09.230
Dunkin got standing ovations every time just walking on stage.

1662
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:10.430
They're going nuts and cheering.

1663
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:14.360
That makes me feel better about comedy than anything.

1664
01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:19.420
Like there's a trick to life and a big part of it is generosity is a big part of

1665
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:24.530
it is appreciation for other people's success.

1666
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.060
A big part of it is being around other people that are trying to go for success

1667
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:31.970
and enhancing each other along the way.
You know,

1668
01:36:31.971 --> 01:36:36.350
having a group of people that are all doing positive shit and move forward and

1669
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:37.161
being,
you know,

1670
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:40.790
doing what they want to do man and having it all come together like everybody

1671
01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:44.630
together doing that together.
That's all like a big juicy enhancement.

1672
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.300
Like Joey Dee has just got number one on iTunes.

1673
01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:52.280
He said number one comedy CD on iTunes.
Dude Dude,
he called me up.
He goes,

1674
01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:52.661
Joe Rogan,

1675
01:36:52.661 --> 01:36:55.340
I just want to thank you very much for doing this with fucking knock them dead.

1676
01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:58.220
That's just beginning when laying bitches out.
He was going crazy.

1677
01:36:58.221 --> 01:37:01.130
It was full on fire it up full on,
fire it up.

1678
01:37:01.131 --> 01:37:05.060
He was on a hundred percent Joey Diaz.
I thought he was so excited.
Yeah,

1679
01:37:05.061 --> 01:37:08.660
but I mean how,
how could that have ever happened before?
He has his podcast,

1680
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:12.500
his podcast,
a beauty and the beast.
People love that fucking podcast.

1681
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.800
Dunkin's podcast is,
he's killing it on that podcast.

1682
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:18.020
People love the Dunkin's new podcast,

1683
01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:22.880
always pockets and all of that shit happens.
It builds us all up.
It helps us all.

1684
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.450
You need to start a podcast,
dude,
for sure.
You need to do a podcast.
I,

1685
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:33.080
it's just,
it's easy dudes.
I Dunno man.

1686
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.460
You got time.
You should.

1687
01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:36.770
You should seriously consider it because I think it would,

1688
01:37:36.771 --> 01:37:38.930
it would blow your fucking seminars through the roof.

1689
01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:42.620
It would be a way where you could instantly talk to people,

1690
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:46.700
address questions.
It's hard,
man.
You know I got the baby just came.
Oh,

1691
01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:48.680
I hear you brother.
I mean,
you don't have to do it right away,

1692
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.530
but start thinking about it and then when you get to a position where you get

1693
01:37:51.531 --> 01:37:53.030
just a couple of free hours a week,

1694
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:56.040
you know what you think you might be able to devote to that slide

1695
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.770
<v 2>on in your thing will be a hit right off the bat.
Dude,
I'm going to do this.</v>

1696
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:03.771
Podcast is 14 year old kid does his own podcast and he does it all on kiss every

1697
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:10.250
he got into Kinzie's 14 and 2008 that's when I got into because in 1978 and he's

1698
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:16.380
a kiss fucking maniac.
I'm going to do as podcasts like in a week.

1699
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.140
And I heard one of his podcasts and he's like a little genius.

1700
01:38:19.141 --> 01:38:21.120
He's 14 years old running the show.
He's the host.

1701
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:25.110
He's like a little baby Howard Stern.
You didn't meet him at Clark?
Did you know?

1702
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:30.060
I met him through Twitter and then you know,
he gave me,
she has a van.

1703
01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.540
But yeah.
But I,
you know,
I think about it every now and then,
but I,

1704
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:40.600
I don't mind the way my life is right now,
you know,

1705
01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:43.110
just to add like I hear what you're saying.

1706
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:48.350
I like my life the way it is and if I added a show then I'd be forced to talk

1707
01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:51.360
all the time.
I like just being a guest every now and then.

1708
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:53.940
I like it like then and everything stays fresh.

1709
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.000
I Dunno about like trying to keep it together.
I'm going to be involved.

1710
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.400
You think you know a bloody Twitter war tonight with pro nine 11 people.

1711
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.010
I love those guys.
Those guys are awesome.

1712
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:10.620
The building was on fire.
It was proven.

1713
01:39:10.621 --> 01:39:13.980
Look,
look,
here's the link.
It was on fire.
Like those guys are hilarious.

1714
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:15.660
There's a lot of smart people and that's hard.

1715
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:19.850
There's a lot of smart people that don't think that it was an inside job.
Aye,

1716
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:21.720
look,
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

1717
01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:26.930
I reserve my right to not form an opinion on that and I just look at all of it

1718
01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:27.600
and I go,
yeah,

1719
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.560
there's certainly some fuckery afoot that Donald Rumsfeld thing is crazy.

1720
01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.080
That's really crossed.
Not even tower seven.

1721
01:39:34.081 --> 01:39:39.081
I mean how amazingly coincidental adjustive that happened alone.

1722
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:43.530
If that happened without the towers,
you would be like,
wait a minute,
what?

1723
01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:45.750
But because the towers went down to,

1724
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.570
it was almost like there's so much chaos in one day.

1725
01:39:48.571 --> 01:39:51.360
They got away with that depth Pentagon.
Perfect.
It's really,

1726
01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:54.240
if you want him to steal $2 trillion in money,

1727
01:39:54.241 --> 01:39:57.720
if they're really did steal that much money,
I mean,
wow.

1728
01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:01.380
Would that not be the greatest jacking in the history of humanity?

1729
01:40:01.381 --> 01:40:05.820
If they really did pull that off and all of that was just designed to cover up

1730
01:40:05.821 --> 01:40:09.450
their jacking of the of the records in the Pentagon and then they said,
well,

1731
01:40:09.451 --> 01:40:10.440
you know what,
while we're at it,

1732
01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:15.210
let's just go to war with Iraq and take their shit.
Boom.
I get these big diff,

1733
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.120
I mean if they just decided like we got this dude,

1734
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:21.090
everybody is on our side or just American flags everywhere.

1735
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.700
Let's just run with this shit.
Let's run with it,
and they just ran with it.

1736
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:28.440
There's just storm troopin taking money on CNN.

1737
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.660
Oh man,
this is real.

1738
01:40:30.661 --> 01:40:35.661
This is really happening with real people and real bullets in 2012 scary shit,

1739
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:42.030
man.
It's amazing Gary.
Like how do you trust a government like that?
How do you,

1740
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:46.020
how does Obama become that guy?
He's like,
oh,
only a few years older than me.

1741
01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:47.340
That freaks me out.

1742
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.960
How does a guy who grew up essentially in the same area as me and who grew up

1743
01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:54.850
around a lot of like leftists and a lot of like,
you know,

1744
01:40:54.851 --> 01:40:57.630
like he grew up around like he knew some dude with that.
It was,

1745
01:40:57.631 --> 01:41:01.690
it was her professor who was from the weather underground.
That radical group.

1746
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:06.010
Obama's part.
Yeah,
Obama's perfect.
Think about it,
George W.

1747
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.140
Bush fucked up so hard.

1748
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:11.410
The only way that we're going to keep the power of the people we're about to

1749
01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:14.350
fucking say,
fuck this revolution.

1750
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:18.680
Let's give him Obama calm him down.
That was perfect.
We'll throw,

1751
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.100
we'll fucking take all this shit and we'll drop Obama on them

1752
01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:27.850
buying another eight years.
Maybe another longer.
Dude that was up there.

1753
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.140
It was all perfect and the Kootenai Obama run against a dude who was almost dead

1754
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:36.490
and some crazy check.
It was perfect.
It really is worth it.

1755
01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:41.560
Whoever was putting this together and probably laughing and the writing probably

1756
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:45.100
fucking bus.
Whose idea was Sarah Pailin?

1757
01:41:45.101 --> 01:41:49.160
That dude probably got like $1 million,
a dollar bonus from some Illuminati guy.

1758
01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.850
You know,
she,
she probably could win.

1759
01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.950
If there was a a sensible,

1760
01:41:56.951 --> 01:42:00.790
a person who was a real powerful Republican and he was the president and he

1761
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:03.250
wanted her as a vice president at this point in time,

1762
01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.110
she might actually be able to get in.

1763
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:10.150
She's become such a public celebrity and there's enough stupid people out there

1764
01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:11.660
that don't even see what's going on.

1765
01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.990
They're just flowing right with it and if they could just coach her,

1766
01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:16.930
if she would take some coaching,
apparently she's not in a good to take coaching,

1767
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:19.050
which is one of the problems with her and they had on the car,
it should be.

1768
01:42:19.051 --> 01:42:22.690
She became a maverick yourself there on her own getting crazy,

1769
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.460
telling the people what she really thinks.

1770
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:31.120
She became a celebrity ticketless man,
this is insane,
this beautiful.

1771
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:33.400
It's a movie.
It's like,
you know,

1772
01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:37.240
it really supports the theory that we're living inside some sort of a computer

1773
01:42:37.241 --> 01:42:42.100
generated reality when the more preposterous things happen,
that's ridiculous.

1774
01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:44.800
The more silly things happen in the news like that,

1775
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:49.390
the more just ridiculous scenarios play out over and over again.

1776
01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:53.980
The more you got to just question like could you imagine if it really does turn

1777
01:42:53.981 --> 01:42:57.790
out that this whole thing is bullshit and you wake up one day and you and your

1778
01:42:57.791 --> 01:42:59.110
friends just uh,

1779
01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:03.940
he had shot up with some weird electronic drug that takes you on some 40 year

1780
01:43:03.941 --> 01:43:07.620
journey and then brings you back cause other dimension yeah,

1781
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:12.670
brings you back and to you it was only a few minutes of time and that's your

1782
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:15.940
whole life man.
Anything's possible.

1783
01:43:15.941 --> 01:43:19.080
Now could you imagine how weird that would be?
Anything in life was a series of,

1784
01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.120
of of re expanding and contracting little existences like that to take place and

1785
01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:27.040
the full lifetime inside of torn.

1786
01:43:27.041 --> 01:43:32.041
It's you're born with only two skills only to fucking screaming and you're,

1787
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.240
the sucking muscles in your mouth are so developed.
You're,
you're born,

1788
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:39.210
you have no control it fucking head.
You know,

1789
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:40.360
what the hell are you doing with your arm?

1790
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.820
Your muscles are nowhere near being develop.

1791
01:43:42.821 --> 01:43:44.380
Your legs are just kind of flopping around.

1792
01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:47.560
But though sucking muscles fully developed,

1793
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:52.010
the vocal cords develop.
You would think of baby would come out with vocal cords

1794
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.110
<v 1>and they couldn't scream it.
How the fuck are they screaming?</v>

1795
01:43:54.111 --> 01:43:58.130
So goddamn now that's developed shit.
It's like you come in to powers,
right?

1796
01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:00.470
You come in,
okay,
you're going to get sucking.

1797
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:03.800
Everyone comes in with just sucking and scream screaming.
That's it.

1798
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:07.640
Can't feed yourself.
Some days I'm a go in,
no fucking sucking,
no screaming.

1799
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.020
I want to figure this shadow them.
I know do.
It's dangerous,
Bro.
It's dangerous.

1800
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:15.170
Yet is any baby were combined and go sup,
Sup,
I'm here.

1801
01:44:17.530 --> 01:44:21.620
Yeah,
I mean are there they,
you know,
there's a,

1802
01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.800
I don't know if you call it a movement or or what it is,

1803
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:28.610
but there's people out there that believe in indigo children.

1804
01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:32.900
You know what this is and you do it.
No,
supposedly it's,

1805
01:44:32.901 --> 01:44:37.640
this is like some crazy new age shit that there are children that are born

1806
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:42.140
nowadays that are super smart,
like right when they're born.
I can,

1807
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:46.730
they're super enlightened and I don't this,
this is probably all bullshit,

1808
01:44:46.731 --> 01:44:51.260
but if you go on youtube type in indigo children and they're like super

1809
01:44:51.261 --> 01:44:55.340
brilliant enlightened kit and caught autistic.
I Dunno,
maybe,

1810
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:59.000
maybe it's a form of art to me,
a little bit of that,
right?
Maybe.
Maybe,

1811
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.863
I don't know,
but

1812
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:03.810
<v 0>I've never met a a genius autistic kid.
Have you crazy.</v>

1813
01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:07.760
I think that they all are most like,
like if you look at any of these movies,

1814
01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:09.510
like you know,
definitely whopping are definitely Washington,

1815
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:11.420
but they always have like this memory,
you know,

1816
01:45:11.421 --> 01:45:14.710
where they can remember a thousand things.
They're almost like on it.

1817
01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.410
But if they're a step past us and they're,

1818
01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:20.420
they're just not until the gossip and bullshit of normal day lies.

1819
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:23.870
But you had their fucking figuring out.
Right.
You know?
Well,
you know,

1820
01:45:23.871 --> 01:45:25.700
at a certain point in time the question becomes like,

1821
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:30.730
what is is all of our emotions and all of our caveman ideas and genetics is all

1822
01:45:30.981 --> 01:45:33.590
that really going to be effective?
Do we need all these crazy emotions?

1823
01:45:33.591 --> 01:45:35.010
Do we need all this,
this,
this,

1824
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:37.580
this weird way of interacting with each other after a while.

1825
01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:39.110
Can that become something else?

1826
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:42.920
And it could become something that's maybe more effective mathematically and

1827
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:47.120
something that's maybe just not,
not as inclined to be swayed by emotion.

1828
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:49.160
You know,
that it's just like a little detached,

1829
01:45:49.161 --> 01:45:51.470
a little detached from the human experience,

1830
01:45:51.471 --> 01:45:54.240
but much more elevated in a certain way.
I mean,
we've,

1831
01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:57.300
we look at it like it's a disease,
but on some of them maybe it's not,
you know,

1832
01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:00.320
look at like,
look at the language,
look how we're texting back and forth.

1833
01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:02.700
I like Twitter and we're not even using real words anymore.

1834
01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:07.110
This and 20 years is autism.
Yeah,
that's a really good point because if you,

1835
01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.430
if you think about how much is lost in a text message,
man,

1836
01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:13.790
the only people that I like texting with or people that I'm already close with

1837
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:17.150
because then,
you know,
I could,
uh,
you know,
if you text me,

1838
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:19.230
where are you at and saw your mother's supposed to,
you know,
you can,

1839
01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.720
we laugh at each other.
You know what I mean?
You could joke around.

1840
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:27.320
We're all going to be autistic holograms in the future.
That is really possible.

1841
01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:30.440
We're going to be like two pocket Coachella Tupac look like you've been doing

1842
01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:34.460
MMA.
Like maybe he's been training with pop,
maybe he's been doing,

1843
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:39.530
which is a strength and conditioning routine cause he looked yoked in 1980 and

1844
01:46:39.531 --> 01:46:43.530
1980 his clothes were all like just cheesy old nineties clothes or eighties

1845
01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.461
<v 1>how did they do that?</v>

1846
01:46:44.461 --> 01:46:48.430
Did they use actual footage of him and just make holograms of that or I don't

1847
01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.610
know,
$10 million.

1848
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:53.940
<v 2>How long this Coachella been around for?
Wow.
I was,</v>

1849
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:57.810
that's where 15 years was to talk live when Coachella was around.

1850
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:01.620
Did he ever play a Coachella?
I'm not sure.
Well this,

1851
01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:06.440
this Tupac was saying what sub?
Coachella.
So put the back.

1852
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:09.350
<v 7>I think the whole thing was an act or whole thing is like a fake Tupac.
Yeah.</v>

1853
01:47:09.351 --> 01:47:12.650
Yeah.
That was the CGI and that was someone else's voice.

1854
01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.890
<v 2>Ooh,
there's something creepy.
Voice is easy to cop the band gorillas.</v>

1855
01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:19.250
<v 7>I don't know if you know anything about gorillas,</v>

1856
01:47:19.251 --> 01:47:22.220
how they tried to rub it out and they're actually been doing this for a while

1857
01:47:22.221 --> 01:47:25.580
using holograms in their latest one.
I guess it's just,

1858
01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:27.160
I don't know if it's out yet or no,

1859
01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:30.200
but they were going to be doing the same kind of technology as this,

1860
01:47:30.201 --> 01:47:33.830
but where they go out into the crowd,
like they have like,
like a walkway,

1861
01:47:33.831 --> 01:47:35.480
like kind of,
uh,
we're,
you know,

1862
01:47:35.481 --> 01:47:40.481
fashion model views or their band members will walk out and in Hall Graham Style

1863
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:46.120
<v 2>soon you could like do it.
You don't have you record one concert and go home.</v>

1864
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.080
[inaudible] he's holograms.
What's the coolest thing about this

1865
01:47:50.890 --> 01:47:54.820
<v 7>exist in that?
That even though the price tag for it,
it was $10 million,</v>

1866
01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:59.410
but seeing a movie for your first time back in whenever the 20s or 30s a silent

1867
01:47:59.411 --> 01:48:00.700
movie,
it used to be like,
wow,

1868
01:48:00.701 --> 01:48:03.520
look at this amazing thing and now you have it on your phone.

1869
01:48:03.670 --> 01:48:06.010
So the cool thing about this technology,
it's that,
you know,

1870
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:09.460
it will be coming to us in a cheaper way and form factors somehow.

1871
01:48:09.461 --> 01:48:12.760
And we're all going to be star wars in around with our princess layers telling

1872
01:48:12.761 --> 01:48:13.200
us the hell.

1873
01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.380
<v 2>So what an Eob.
One you'll buy only hope.
Yeah,
yeah,
no shit.</v>

1874
01:48:17.381 --> 01:48:19.990
And that was terrible technology.
Princess Leia looked like shit,

1875
01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:22.790
that's gonna fucking bring porn back.
Big

1876
01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:28.060
ex-girlfriends will very mixed girl Wolf Blitzer

1877
01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:34.600
be considered cheating.
No holograms.

1878
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:39.330
You can't fuck a hologram.
So no,
it's not cheating.
But it'd be like,
Oh fuck you.

1879
01:48:39.331 --> 01:48:41.720
Fuck a Hologram.
But you use the fleshlight.

1880
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:46.720
But the Hologram was just a video thing.
You're not going to be able to touch it,

1881
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:48.130
but you use it up.
Hold on,

1882
01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.730
hold on a flash site and you can put the Hologram right on.
You're like,

1883
01:48:50.731 --> 01:48:53.420
she's lap dancing and you jack the fleshlight.

1884
01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:56.650
You better off just getting real close to it and looking at it and just,

1885
01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.870
I think it'll work late on the top of the flashlight.

1886
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:10.630
Put her inside a hot hologram and the hologram moves to her.
She's like,

1887
01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.280
she controls it,
right?

1888
01:49:12.281 --> 01:49:15.130
So she has a thin layer of a hologram around that ugly body.

1889
01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:18.910
You might be able to Hologram your face.
Oh,
that's a hologram.
That's true.

1890
01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:19.893
Good point.

1891
01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:24.820
You the grabbing some fucking beautiful person made on your pay.

1892
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.860
Makeup's going to be a Hologram

1893
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:28.640
<v 7>in the future.
Hell yeah,
that'd be cool.</v>

1894
01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:32.980
<v 2>Well yeah,
made you load without a hologram.
Your whole face on.</v>

1895
01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.470
You could put a different face on magic going out.

1896
01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:38.800
Then you talking to a girl and you see like

1897
01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.930
a lot of times you can go like a hologram.
The only thing is like your Dick,

1898
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.110
the the first like half an inch of our lips.
It's like transparent.

1899
01:49:50.111 --> 01:49:54.380
Like you could see through it.
What's going on.
This is all here.

1900
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:55.600
It's really good.

1901
01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:01.120
I have something to tell you that's my,
but that'd be cool.

1902
01:50:01.121 --> 01:50:06.090
Like change clothes,
you know like Ah,
I want a suit.
You know like yeah,

1903
01:50:06.091 --> 01:50:09.310
you just walk around naked with a hologram on.
Imagine if,
I mean,

1904
01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:10.210
what the fuck man,

1905
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:13.810
there's a lot of places without them might actually be like that might feel
nice.

1906
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:17.050
Big Hologram dicks.
There'll be huge right.

1907
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:21.530
Girls would go to grab it and fall for it.
Don't

1908
01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:27.270
grab it.
Yeah,

1909
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:28.230
<v 7>fall on your face.</v>

1910
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:33.960
That's so fucking interesting idea that we can eventually change the actual

1911
01:50:33.961 --> 01:50:35.970
visual visual appearance of things.

1912
01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:38.790
You know that we could do it like if you ever seen those walls,

1913
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:44.030
there's like a certain kind of wallpaper and they have that has like lights and

1914
01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:48.180
yeah,
like he paper what does it and it changes like what does it,

1915
01:50:48.181 --> 01:50:49.680
you turn it on and like what does it,

1916
01:50:49.710 --> 01:50:51.930
what does it do exactly what it pretty much,

1917
01:50:51.931 --> 01:50:55.390
it's like a photo wall LCD screen where he'll be able to like I that future,

1918
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:59.100
I don't know what that one is but the technology's out where eventually we will

1919
01:50:59.101 --> 01:51:03.090
have laws where that would be a screen and you could turn it on I texture or a

1920
01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:06.390
color of a wall.
You could turn on the TV on the wall.
You know,

1921
01:51:06.391 --> 01:51:10.170
you can make windows where we'll be able to like Skype and one corner on the

1922
01:51:10.171 --> 01:51:12.270
other side have just like a fireplace,

1923
01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.380
<v 2>minority report type shit.
That's happening man.
That's on the way edge.</v>

1924
01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.780
Isn't it weird how they,
we've got fat and ugly mastered.

1925
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:24.170
Like you can make someone look fat and ugly but they can't do good looking.

1926
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:27.890
What do you mean fake good looking like,
you know,
like mom big Mama's house.
Oh,

1927
01:51:27.891 --> 01:51:31.820
right,
right,
right.
The fat suits.
What a fat became hot.

1928
01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:35.940
Like in 20 years.
It probably won't happen.
Dudes are getting fat suits and ship.

1929
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.040
It used to be used to be for girls,
used to be a sign of uh,

1930
01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.950
her being from a wealth cause you can fatten her ass up.

1931
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:47.840
Everybody else was starving to death unless she was warmer
back then.

1932
01:51:47.841 --> 01:51:51.260
All you needed was like Turkey and fucking all this food on the table and people

1933
01:51:51.261 --> 01:51:52.910
thought you were rich as fuck.
Like,
oh my God,

1934
01:51:52.911 --> 01:51:56.480
look at all the food spit just keeps eating.
You just keep eating food.

1935
01:51:56.690 --> 01:51:58.460
Like if you're a fat fuck,
that was awesome.

1936
01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:00.500
It's like you just can't just sit around and eat.

1937
01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.750
There was dark times and this species history where people would just scrounging

1938
01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:07.880
and scratching and it got to the point where fat,

1939
01:52:07.881 --> 01:52:12.830
obese people were sexy because they were desirable.
It's so rare,
so rare.

1940
01:52:12.831 --> 01:52:15.470
Someone just can lay around and do nothing and eat.

1941
01:52:15.710 --> 01:52:19.100
I can see that coming back for sure.
Sure.
I wonder,
I wonder what time to come.

1942
01:52:19.101 --> 01:52:19.934
Right?
Yeah.

1943
01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.960
I wonder when grabbing chips by the head and dragging him through the fucking

1944
01:52:23.961 --> 01:52:27.410
dirt became illegal.
Well,
it might be on the way back.

1945
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:31.100
You look at this Chris Brown thing.
Chris Brown is a huge star beat up.

1946
01:52:31.101 --> 01:52:33.620
Rihanna is still a huge star,
bigger star than ever.

1947
01:52:33.621 --> 01:52:37.310
And I didn't beat her up again,
but you know what I mean?
Never really.
I mean,

1948
01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:40.060
people who didn't really hurt his career.
I mean people talk shit about her,

1949
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:42.350
but it actually probably made a bigger and other friends again,

1950
01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:45.680
so it's probably getting more acceptable.
So I like you should it by the way.

1951
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:45.980
There's

1952
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.470
<v 6>some people that accused me of being,
um,
a massage,</v>

1953
01:52:48.471 --> 01:52:52.790
earnest Brian Online and I'm so sad.
You've always been.
Every since I was sad.

1954
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:56.480
Do you think for new people that think that it's so sad,
listen,

1955
01:52:56.481 --> 01:53:01.070
but if you're a dumb cunt,
yeah,
I'm a massage nest against dump counts only,

1956
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:04.310
but I'm not like against like regular women.
I like Virgo women.

1957
01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:06.860
Regular women are some of the nicest people I know.
You know,

1958
01:53:06.861 --> 01:53:09.500
they're not burdened by a lot of the testosterone issues that men have.

1959
01:53:09.501 --> 01:53:14.150
I don't have any problem with most women,
but dumb dude's,
it's the same if you,

1960
01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:16.720
if you don't like dumb dudes and you start shitting on dumb dudes,

1961
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:20.360
nobody ever says you fucking hate dude's exactly hate men.

1962
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.900
But if you have any scenario where a chick says something stupid,

1963
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:27.050
even if you generalize and say like,
chick shouldn't be president,
you know,

1964
01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:29.570
I don't think men should give birth either.
Don't get me wrong.
I mean,

1965
01:53:29.571 --> 01:53:30.890
it's not an even exchange here,

1966
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:35.030
but I certainly am not a massage just by any stretch of the imagination or of

1967
01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:38.540
don't filter yourself on,
on sexist.
You know,
when you're [inaudible],

1968
01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:42.140
if somebody is being a fucking idiot,
you,
you'll say if the guy or a girl,

1969
01:53:42.141 --> 01:53:46.490
and I think that's what it is.
A lot of times I try to be nicest prossible about,

1970
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:48.700
especially now,
you know,
like when you,

1971
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:51.770
especially when you're talking to a chick or a lot of times chicks are a little

1972
01:53:51.771 --> 01:53:56.060
bit more sensitive to criticism or the potential possibility that you're a mean

1973
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:57.650
asshole and going to say something mean to her.

1974
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.220
I tried to be a lot nicer about it.
Are You going to go pee?
All right.

1975
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:02.083
Good luck with that.

1976
01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:07.490
Right now we're just going to talk about me being a massage and a homophobe or

1977
01:54:07.491 --> 01:54:11.000
something.
I don't know neither of those things.
I'm not,
I'm no perfect person,

1978
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:13.250
but when I tell you that my real true,

1979
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.740
honest feelings and intentions and how I express them on the spot,

1980
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:19.190
not a homophobe at all,
that's silly.

1981
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.540
I'm neither that nor am I a sexist person.
I try to be real.

1982
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:27.050
Even with this is a lot of things I don't like.
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not an,

1983
01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.101
I'm not like a,

1984
01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:31.450
a person without adjuncts are a person that doesn't get upset at things and I'm

1985
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:33.860
certainly not enlightened and then shape or form,

1986
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.480
but I'm pretty even about what I like and don't like.
If you're nice,
I like you.

1987
01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.990
I'm,
I'm a fucking easy going guy.
There's a lot of comedians and I don't even,

1988
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:45.590
I can't even watch their act.
They're terrible.
But if they're nice to me,

1989
01:54:45.591 --> 01:54:47.780
I'm nice to them.
I'm nice to everybody.
That's nice to me.

1990
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:51.500
That's how I treat the world.
And if you're a woman and you're nice to me,

1991
01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:56.150
we're friends,
period.
Since it's that simple.
But for whatever reason,
if he,

1992
01:54:56.151 --> 01:55:00.450
was there any ever any conflict of you with a women,
with a women,
with a woman,

1993
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:02.400
with what?
A name,
women folk.
Uh,

1994
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.030
if there's any conflict ever and it's documented online,

1995
01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:08.510
automatically going to point to that one moment in time and there's a woman

1996
01:55:08.511 --> 01:55:12.620
heckler or any of that shit.
The feminist,

1997
01:55:12.621 --> 01:55:15.050
the feminist video is a perfect example of me not trying,

1998
01:55:15.230 --> 01:55:17.780
trying to not get into a thing with her.
I didn't want to,

1999
01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.070
I was trying to be nice.

2000
01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:23.780
I tried to be nice always until you can't be nice anymore and then you like get

2001
01:55:23.781 --> 01:55:26.570
outta here bitch.
You know that's,
it's not my preference.

2002
01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:29.300
My preference is certainly it'd be nice.
And you too man.

2003
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.990
One of the nicest guys I know.
You know,

2004
01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.190
one of the cool things about Jujitsu is that the,

2005
01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.180
the dudes that do it generally speaking,

2006
01:55:35.181 --> 01:55:39.080
are so much more relaxed ego wise than your average guy.

2007
01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.360
And you meet so many nice guys,
like so many people when,

2008
01:55:42.361 --> 01:55:45.390
when they have their in check,
when they do Jujitsu and it's fucking hard.

2009
01:55:45.391 --> 01:55:48.450
It's not easy to go out there and put your ass on the line and you know,

2010
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:51.930
you work all day and you're tired and then you go to a fucking Jujitsu class,

2011
01:55:51.931 --> 01:55:54.270
especially when you're a beginner,
that shit is hard as fuck.

2012
01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.510
You get your ass kicked.
It's terrible.
But if you can get through that gauntlet,

2013
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.360
if you can get through that,
become a Bluebell,
become a purple belt.

2014
01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:03.240
There's like certain qualities that those guys have about them.

2015
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:06.570
They're just more relaxed.
Like Mike Maxwell,
the guy who does my poster.

2016
01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:09.400
Do you see my poster?
I did for the Chicago show?
No Dude,

2017
01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:12.870
this guy is so talented and he just did another one for me for the Atlanta show.

2018
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:16.440
He's got to what his website,
Mike Maxwell,
art.com he's a,

2019
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:18.270
he's a blue belt and he's a,

2020
01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.100
he's trains with a Nogueira down in San good with graphics graphics.
Great,

2021
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:25.510
brilliant,
brilliant artist.
But he's got,

2022
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:29.460
he's got that same sort of personality about him.
He's a great guy.

2023
01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:32.760
He's easy going cause the dude trains,
he trains,
he gets,

2024
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:36.090
he doesn't have any weird insecurity issues like a lot of people have.
You know,

2025
01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:40.110
there's a lot of dudes out there I think in it not having a martial art.

2026
01:56:40.111 --> 01:56:43.770
And obviously I'm extremely biased when I voiced his opinion and it's not for

2027
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:45.900
everybody.
Like obviously I don't think it's for Brian.

2028
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.190
Everybody's personality is different.

2029
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:50.760
Brian has no desire to do any of that stuff.
But for a lot of people they do.

2030
01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.120
You're in but you're not insecure about like getting into a situation where you

2031
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:56.430
get into fight with guys.
He was just,
you'll just get out of there.

2032
01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.530
There's a lot of guys who were in their manhood is threatened.

2033
01:56:58.830 --> 01:57:02.220
They want to puff up their chests and they can get in trouble and it's a scary

2034
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:06.090
moment for them.
Opposite of that,
you are so I'm,
I don't say it's for everybody.

2035
01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.890
We all have their own paths in life,

2036
01:57:07.891 --> 01:57:11.880
but for a lot of people he can fucking help tremendously.

2037
01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.610
It's a missing part of our lives.

2038
01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.720
We are our whole body of this.
The system,

2039
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:23.430
the way the mind operates is all essentially set up for conflict.

2040
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:27.830
We're set up for physical activity,
for conflict.
We're set up for,

2041
01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:32.550
for figuring out who's the alpha of the chimpanzee,
the human thing,

2042
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:36.030
whatever the fuck we are.
I mean every,
every animal has,
has alpha.

2043
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:40.530
Every a primate rather has like that Alpha structure and that's what we have to,

2044
01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:44.670
we have this constant competition but it doesn't happen and instead it manifests

2045
01:57:44.671 --> 01:57:45.810
itself as business,

2046
01:57:45.811 --> 01:57:50.190
which is weird and buttoned down with strange clothes and weird rules and no

2047
01:57:50.191 --> 01:57:52.620
swears and there's a lot of restrictions.

2048
01:57:52.621 --> 01:57:56.820
There's a lot of suppression suppressing the true instincts of the animal,

2049
01:57:56.821 --> 01:58:01.500
the human organism and Jujitsu allows you to express the true instincts of the

2050
01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:05.670
animal organism in a safe way that actually you benefit from and you develop

2051
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:08.190
character from.
You know,
and there's,
there's,

2052
01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:13.230
there's a real benefit to that that obviously you experience obviously I

2053
01:58:13.231 --> 01:58:16.980
experienced and you give out when you're teaching Jujitsu,
when you're,

2054
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:20.940
what you're doing with 10 planets,
10th planet,
Jiu Jitsu with a website,

2055
01:58:20.941 --> 01:58:23.040
with offering the,

2056
01:58:23.041 --> 01:58:27.180
mastering the system so you can watch different techniques and learn from them

2057
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:27.960
online.

2058
01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:32.130
We read what you're doing as you're spreading this incredible tool to become a

2059
01:58:32.131 --> 01:58:35.590
better human being.
You spreading this incredible tool to,

2060
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:39.690
to help you master your own personal space a little bit better.

2061
01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.010
Look at that,
Eddie Bravo.

2062
01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:46.150
<v 2>Well thank you very much.
That was bitches.
Thank you.
Thank,
I appreciate that.</v>

2063
01:58:46.330 --> 01:58:49.840
Now you say,
you were saying that it's terrible and you get your ads.

2064
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:53.680
It's awful in the beginning.
You don't mean that.
Let me clarify that.

2065
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:56.650
He doesn't mean it's terrible.
Like you have just a terrible time.

2066
01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:58.210
He means terrible.

2067
01:58:58.211 --> 01:59:01.840
Like if you started playing a new video game for the first time and you're going

2068
01:59:01.841 --> 01:59:05.200
to one on one against people,
they would be killing you and it's terrible.

2069
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:07.900
You're losing all the time,
but no one's really getting hurt.

2070
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:09.310
You're not going to get hurt on Jujitsu.

2071
01:59:09.311 --> 01:59:10.870
It's not terrible or you're getting hurt.

2072
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:15.220
You might get hurt like at the same rate as you would play in basketball three

2073
01:59:15.221 --> 01:59:18.280
times a week going to fuck your shoulder up.
You might fuck your knee up,

2074
01:59:18.430 --> 01:59:22.330
twist an ankle.
It's the same thing.
I've been doing Jujitsu 18 years.

2075
01:59:22.331 --> 01:59:27.070
I've never needed surgery.
It was pretty amazing.
I know a lot of guys like that.

2076
01:59:27.071 --> 01:59:29.530
Eventually you will tweet,
you know you can tweak your knee.

2077
01:59:29.650 --> 01:59:33.220
You might tear an ACL,
you might need some surgery,
but it's no,

2078
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:37.330
it's actually super safe and when I say terrible,

2079
01:59:37.331 --> 01:59:40.030
what I really mean is like,
you're not going to win.
That's all it is.

2080
01:59:40.031 --> 01:59:42.880
It's really fun to learn though and you,
before you even spar,

2081
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:46.180
you're going to go through drills where you're showing the technique and you

2082
01:59:46.181 --> 01:59:48.550
execute it on someone who was not resisting.

2083
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:52.180
And by learning it that way you know you do and putting the repetitions you

2084
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:54.370
eventually absolutely can develop those techniques.

2085
01:59:54.371 --> 01:59:57.760
The beautiful thing about the techniques that you Jitsu is most of them don't

2086
01:59:58.150 --> 02:00:02.710
even require any real unusual physical attributes.

2087
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:04.180
You don't have to be unusually strong.

2088
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:08.290
You just have to have leverage in position and a lot of people could apply.

2089
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:11.530
A lot of people out there don't even work out if you taught them a rear naked

2090
02:00:11.531 --> 02:00:14.800
choke and then you let them put it on you,
they could put you to sleep.

2091
02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:17.440
People don't even work out,
they don't even train.

2092
02:00:17.441 --> 02:00:21.220
The techniques are really that effective,
you know,
so you'll get better.

2093
02:00:21.221 --> 02:00:23.740
It's 100% you'll get better.
You just have to put in the numbers.

2094
02:00:23.741 --> 02:00:26.800
And that's one of the things that are really always appreciated about the way

2095
02:00:26.801 --> 02:00:31.710
you talk about Jujitsu is a,
you are always really humble in that,

2096
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.710
that regard.

2097
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:35.530
And you're always make sure that you let people know that there's nothing

2098
02:00:35.531 --> 02:00:38.170
unusual but you,
you're not a great athlete.
This is not,

2099
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:41.410
this is all just thinking and putting in the numbers and doing the proper

2100
02:00:41.411 --> 02:00:45.670
technique and anyone can do it and you,
oh yeah,
children do it,

2101
02:00:45.671 --> 02:00:49.030
old ladies do it.
It's never too late to do it.
You can,

2102
02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:54.060
it doesn't matter if you're 50 or 60 42 if you want to learn how to subdue

2103
02:00:55.451 --> 02:01:00.280
someone and put them to sleep scientifically in a very nonviolent way,

2104
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:01.870
you're doing it with a bunch of nerds.

2105
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:06.520
It's Jujitsu itself has a Douche bag filter.
We've talked about that before.

2106
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:10.270
Douchebags can handle getting tap can handle losing a game of death.

2107
02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:12.610
Even though no one gets hurt,
their ego gets hurt.

2108
02:01:12.611 --> 02:01:14.800
So it automatically keeps Douche bags out.

2109
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.300
So that's a few sneak in every now and then they do.
But you know,

2110
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:22.960
every time I'm on the podcast,
we talk about this,
you know,
I know beaten,

2111
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.210
you know I'm beating everyone over the head with this,

2112
02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:27.580
but there's Jujitsu everywhere.

2113
02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:31.420
There's every practically every city has a Jujitsu school.

2114
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:34.000
Find a Jujitsu school,
whether it's no gay are gay,

2115
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:39.140
get into it because within a year and time flies within a year,

2116
02:01:39.141 --> 02:01:41.870
sometimes even six months depending on how fast you pick it up.

2117
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:46.870
But at the most a year you will be able to take an untrained man and a dude who

2118
02:01:48.081 --> 02:01:51.860
doesn't do Jujitsu obviously.
And most people don't.
If anything goes wrong,

2119
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:54.410
you know,
at the movie theater with your family,
with your kids,

2120
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:56.270
with your girlfriend,
someone steps up,

2121
02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:00.350
you will have the confidence to put that guy to sleep and just extinguish the

2122
02:02:00.351 --> 02:02:01.100
problem.

2123
02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:05.230
And it gives you so much confidence and not just those type situations but an

2124
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:08.900
everyday situations in business and meetings you just said cause you so much

2125
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:12.540
confidence knowing if anything goes down,
you're safe to,

2126
02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:16.160
I wonder if they're ever going to be able to come out with a Jujitsu dummy that

2127
02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:20.480
is a robot that works on a computer and knows how to execute moves.
Yes,

2128
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:22.460
I'll give you.
Yeah because if you see like these,

2129
02:02:22.461 --> 02:02:24.680
I don't know if you'd want to roll with it cause when my fucking kill you

2130
02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:30.050
because maybe if we get,
if they could get it to be like super sensitive,

2131
02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:34.280
you know,
maybe,
maybe,
I don't know man.
The way they're doing it now,

2132
02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:35.210
the robots they have now,

2133
02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:37.880
they can push them while they're running and they like lean over and then

2134
02:02:37.881 --> 02:02:40.790
rebalance themselves and come back up or they're getting super,

2135
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:44.630
super advanced and I think it's the,
the human body,
like the anatomy,

2136
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:48.170
they already understand it completely.
They know exactly where the bones go.

2137
02:02:48.171 --> 02:02:51.920
They know if they created some sort of an artificial structure that mimic bone

2138
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:55.340
mass and they'd figured out a way to power it and move it around and then

2139
02:02:55.341 --> 02:02:59.480
figured out a way to make it like ultra sensitive to compression and how much it

2140
02:02:59.481 --> 02:03:02.000
squeezing and how,
what,
what position it's in,

2141
02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:04.730
and then make it work like a Jujitsu fucking fire

2142
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:10.670
finish your garage.
Really good defense.
So you worked on your offense,

2143
02:03:10.671 --> 02:03:12.640
like he's constantly escaping your shit.

2144
02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.020
Do you want them to attack a little bit scared that yeah.

2145
02:03:17.070 --> 02:03:19.160
Maybe you have to calibrate your netting fence.
You know what I mean?

2146
02:03:19.161 --> 02:03:21.470
You have to calibrate your neck and make sure it doesn't squeeze.
Be Honest.

2147
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.240
That's scary to people.
You're going to die.
You know?

2148
02:03:24.241 --> 02:03:27.420
We know that to a year at least,
the tapping malfunction,

2149
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.330
you cigarettes kill a lot of people and they're still smoking cigarettes.

2150
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:34.130
Be People fight man.
Yeah.
If they're responsible guys,
they weren't trained.

2151
02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:36.740
That would be the,
yeah,
that would be the argument.
We would say,
listen man,

2152
02:03:36.741 --> 02:03:38.720
cigarettes kill 400,000 people every year.

2153
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:41.840
A few dudes got jacked by the Jujitsu dummy.
All right.

2154
02:03:41.841 --> 02:03:42.800
I'm not getting jacked my mind.

2155
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:44.620
And you could buy one if you are really a low star,

2156
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:48.140
you could buy a black belt one and it's talking shit as you take it out of the

2157
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:51.140
box.
I really bitch.
You think you ready for this really big?

2158
02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:55.370
You can imagine we can get a white belt one and just fucking strangle it.

2159
02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:59.510
Or you can get like different kinds of athletes,
like 190 pound football player,

2160
02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:03.860
like one of those ridiculously powerful and explosive defensive end dudes.

2161
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:08.270
How big would a defensive end?
B,
285 pounds.
How about that?

2162
02:04:08.271 --> 02:04:13.100
How about a 285 pound one and you only,
you only attack it.
It only does defense.

2163
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:17.420
You just gotta it's constantly trying to peel you off of it,

2164
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.570
but it gets tired like a 280 pound man too.

2165
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:23.960
Maybe it only has like a certain day calculate.
It's anaerobic capacity.

2166
02:04:24.230 --> 02:04:26.510
Like if it's muscles are like Bob Sapp style big,

2167
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:28.310
you just got to figure out how to ride it,

2168
02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:33.530
but it won't ever spike you on your head like Bob Sapwood.
Nice.
It's possible.

2169
02:04:33.531 --> 02:04:37.320
Right.
I think maybe by 2023

2170
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:44.040
I wonder if anybody ever bought a gay real doll to use it as a Jujitsu dummy and

2171
02:04:44.041 --> 02:04:47.490
be like,
yeah,
just choking and it's very realistic,
you know,
I don't like,

2172
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.020
you know,
I,
I mean when I do choke and I fuck it,
but that's,
listen,

2173
02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:55.210
this is the survival of the fittest.
Have they made entire thing down?

2174
02:04:55.211 --> 02:04:58.270
It's like an unsaid advancements with a real dog.
Cause how we're starting here,

2175
02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:02.250
we used to push that 20 years ago.
The real dom must be amazing.
Or did they,

2176
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.610
did they plateau?
Hmm.
That's a good question.
Let's go to the prom now.

2177
02:05:05.690 --> 02:05:07.490
<v 7>The biggest problem is,
is that even now,</v>

2178
02:05:07.610 --> 02:05:11.090
they are definitely better now and there's actually companies that that make

2179
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:13.800
real doll knock off or the same technology is real doll,

2180
02:05:13.801 --> 02:05:18.050
but they do better every year.
Do they keep getting better?
All conventions.

2181
02:05:18.051 --> 02:05:19.900
We had a guy on one of our shows a night.

2182
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:24.910
He showed the Christmas roast video and they had a couple of real dollars there

2183
02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:27.710
and they were awesome looking.
But then the vagina,

2184
02:05:27.711 --> 02:05:31.220
which felt like a fleshlight rip off,

2185
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:35.070
like it wasn't as good for,
you're viewing an iPhone right now.

2186
02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.340
Like the latest iPhone stuff.
We're fucking,
I don't think it's there like I,

2187
02:05:38.341 --> 02:05:40.070
I really do think like the flashlights,

2188
02:05:40.071 --> 02:05:44.300
one of the best feeling because they patent it.
Put a fucking flashlight.

2189
02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:47.840
You put a flashlight inside one.
Like there's like,
yeah,
you got a Pepsi.
Yeah,

2190
02:05:48.230 --> 02:05:50.130
absolutely.
If you don't know the whole deck.

2191
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:54.460
<v 2>No,
they have tranny ones.
Oh look at this training.
What they have training foot.</v>

2192
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:58.770
Um,
real dolls.
They have a real dog.
That's a girl with a Dick.
Yeah.

2193
02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:02.520
It looks like her Bush is shaped in the tap out logo.
Oh,

2194
02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.590
hilarious.
No,

2195
02:06:07.591 --> 02:06:10.170
they can't see it real.
That's not fake.
No.

2196
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:15.040
Go to real doll.com and look at shemale double double one.
Throw that up on the,

2197
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:19.560
Oh,
we can't put it on Ustream.
Jesus Christ.
What am I talking about it?
Listen,

2198
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:22.560
don't listen to me.
This is completely illegal.
Did you get shutdown?

2199
02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:23.610
Ustream shut you down.

2200
02:06:23.770 --> 02:06:26.250
<v 7>Yeah.
Well,
here's the thing,
I that's cool that you talked about this,</v>

2201
02:06:26.630 --> 02:06:29.530
that you stream is a,
uh,
business,
you know,

2202
02:06:29.531 --> 02:06:32.320
like they have advertisers and while they've been nice enough to take the

2203
02:06:32.321 --> 02:06:35.230
advertising off our shows and stuff like that,

2204
02:06:35.530 --> 02:06:38.770
they do have to kind of have this kind of policy,
you know,

2205
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:43.270
and one of the content,
yeah,
one of the policies is believe it or not,

2206
02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:48.310
marijuana use any kind of drug use while it might be legal in California showing

2207
02:06:48.311 --> 02:06:51.860
us take bongs and stuff like that.
So it was it from the icehouse chronicles.

2208
02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:55.210
It's from a couple of things.
Uh,
ice house chronicles,

2209
02:06:55.420 --> 02:06:59.110
there was a naughty showed that I had just put up,
uh,
today where there's,

2210
02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:02.740
there was a quick nudity where the girl like took off her clothes and I grabbed

2211
02:07:02.741 --> 02:07:05.470
the camera at the last second and I think there was a little bit of new dude

2212
02:07:05.471 --> 02:07:09.720
that Shit.
But still I pulled the video immediately when that happened,
you know,

2213
02:07:09.721 --> 02:07:11.260
so no one could else could see it.

2214
02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.900
But I still think there's a lot of people that watch this,
that you know,

2215
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:19.180
that marijuana would bug Kodak or you know,
Ford Motor unit.

2216
02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:21.180
If they were a sponsor,
they're not going to be like,
why,

2217
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:23.540
why are we sponsoring bong hits?

2218
02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.580
And Rob was just to the government plan nine 11 who would be fishing.

2219
02:07:29.230 --> 02:07:31.570
Especially she,
yeah.
So I mean it's totally understandable.

2220
02:07:31.571 --> 02:07:35.980
So I just got to remember to remember that for future use.
But luckily,
you

2221
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.730
<v 0>know,
Brad is a good buddy ourselves.</v>

2222
02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:42.340
So he hooked it back up and tell you to delete those or anything?
Uh,
no,

2223
02:07:42.341 --> 02:07:44.560
I just pulled him.
I already had him poured.
I think it was just,

2224
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:48.630
it was automatic wash them.
Those on Vimeo,
Vimeo,

2225
02:07:48.650 --> 02:07:53.530
just going to death squad.
Dot.
TV.
[inaudible] DOT TV on Vimeo.
Yeah.
That's um,

2226
02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:56.020
that's a tricky situation.
Yeah.
I could see that.

2227
02:07:56.290 --> 02:07:59.560
There's a lot of parts of this country where they have archaic marijuana laws.

2228
02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:02.640
Like we need sit there and do shots on camera and it's no problem at all.
Right.

2229
02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:07.300
We might have to limit it to the drinking room.
Smaller outside has no rules.

2230
02:08:07.301 --> 02:08:10.030
Do you could put any music?
No,
know they have rules.

2231
02:08:10.031 --> 02:08:12.400
It's just a little bit more lenient because you're paying for it and there's no

2232
02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:14.250
advertising involved.
This is more of a pay.

2233
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:18.110
Vimeo is more of a paid service where like you can have a director and he'd got

2234
02:08:18.111 --> 02:08:19.820
a short movie that has new DNA,

2235
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:22.720
then you most likely are going to be fine because it's kind of art.

2236
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:26.590
You could use anybody's,
no,
I wouldn't say you could use anyone to music,

2237
02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:30.290
but there's also the,
the laws on music's really fucking weird anyways.

2238
02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:33.670
They tell you do not use any music,

2239
02:08:33.671 --> 02:08:36.430
but if you're talking over music and incentive background and you know,

2240
02:08:36.431 --> 02:08:40.150
does that count or who knows a lot of gray areas for that.

2241
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2242
02:08:41.850 --> 02:08:45.630
<v 0>I'm going to Giorgio sucralose this site to look at his new clothes.
Oh Dude.</v>

2243
02:08:45.631 --> 02:08:47.070
He's got the greatest shirt ever.

2244
02:08:47.550 --> 02:08:51.330
Whereas he's got a purple shirt that has a face and white really big with his

2245
02:08:51.331 --> 02:08:54.420
hair.
You know,
hair is bigger than ever and it says super delicious.

2246
02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:58.910
Oh my goodness.
No,
he doesn't giant.
Oh my gosh.
You're looking at it.

2247
02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:02.040
It's the greatest shit ever.
I would wear that on the podcast.
Georgia.

2248
02:09:02.041 --> 02:09:06.630
You've got to get me one of these silly bitch.
Look at us.
Oh,
so delicious.

2249
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:10.230
Hey,
he's running with it,
man.
He's running with that whole UFO thing.
Dude.

2250
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:15.860
He's really funny.
On four Chan.
You ever seen him?
He goes on four Chan.

2251
02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:21.710
The Photoshop seems other mediums did four Chan get someone killed probably.

2252
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:25.900
Is that true?
I guess you didn't hear that.
No,
I didn't know some of that.

2253
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:28.100
Some fire related thing.
Someone that desert,

2254
02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.780
someone said that it was on but it could be totally a troll probably.
Who knows,

2255
02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.480
but I wouldn't,
I could believe that.

2256
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:40.700
I mean 14 is just a collection of people is a question that did fortune get

2257
02:09:40.701 --> 02:09:45.050
someone killed as the question I left working for channel and anonymous.

2258
02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.520
Yeah,
I do too.
I don't know this.

2259
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:53.420
I'm reading this off some fucking wanky website.
It could be totally horse shit.

2260
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.823
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2261
02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:58.540
<v 0>They,
they keep busting those dudes though.
It's just set.</v>

2262
02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:00.640
Another four Chan user gets busted by the FBI.

2263
02:10:00.641 --> 02:10:02.950
All that was already there was a while ago actually.

2264
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:08.230
What are those guys do exactly.
All right.
Four hanging.
Yeah.
Everyone's terrified.

2265
02:10:08.231 --> 02:10:11.170
If anyone like that anonymous four Chan,
anybody's on the Internet.

2266
02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:14.450
I'm just fucked your shit up kid.
Well,
I don't know what the four Chan guys,

2267
02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:17.420
if 14 is a little different,
that's just a message.
It's crazy for him,
right?

2268
02:10:17.650 --> 02:10:21.180
It's like the most brutal forum on the whole Internet is just take a photo
board.

2269
02:10:21.181 --> 02:10:24.430
Like I was just fun photos and a lot of creepy sex shit.

2270
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.740
But like a lot of the like Internet memes originate there,
right?

2271
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:31.770
The law cats didn't they originate there?
I'm not 100% sure,
but yeah,

2272
02:10:31.810 --> 02:10:34.790
that's the theory.
Right?
So or the pictures with the tech side,

2273
02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:37.530
there's one on my message board,

2274
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:41.620
there's a picture of the dude all fucked up and he's all bleeding and I'll top

2275
02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:45.350
it says at first I thought it was a great idea to throw trash into the dolphin

2276
02:10:45.351 --> 02:10:48.470
pool,
but I didn't know Matt Horwitz was standing right behind me.

2277
02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:54.980
That's funny.
That's Laird's.
There's those are great man.
The Internet,

2278
02:10:54.981 --> 02:10:58.160
like random Internet comedy that comes out of some of those things.

2279
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:01.040
Some are so fun,
man.
It was so fun.

2280
02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.390
Some really hilarious things have been created on the sucralose ones.

2281
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.570
I'm not saying it's aliens,
but it was aliens.

2282
02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:12.290
It's like so many of them here with his fucking hair.

2283
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:16.280
All crazy in the meme as an alien mean.
Some of those are so funny,
dude.

2284
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.760
There's something funny fucking people out there that are trapped in regular

2285
02:11:19.761 --> 02:11:23.150
jobs,
you know?
I'm hoping that's what America,

2286
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:24.980
well that's what I was going to be our next industry.

2287
02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:28.340
Funny Shit we produce on the Internet where they eventually people figured out

2288
02:11:28.341 --> 02:11:32.150
how to make a living just completely straight from the Internet creating either

2289
02:11:32.151 --> 02:11:34.820
podcasts or web series or different things they do.

2290
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:37.070
It's like this is a lot of funny fucking dudes out there.

2291
02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:40.960
Definitely for entertainment.
This is the best time in the whole entire room.

2292
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:44.670
Like if you're giving me these use musician,
by the way.
Hi honey.

2293
02:11:44.690 --> 02:11:46.400
Honey honeys new video that we are in.

2294
02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:51.350
It comes out Thursday and I think it's going to be on IFC dot [inaudible] dot

2295
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.960
com we're in a music video,
bro.
Yeah,

2296
02:11:53.961 --> 02:11:57.720
it was air guitar and playing with my butt and I was playing with his,
but

2297
02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:02.230
we were just standing around looking like retards,
really acting.

2298
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:04.910
We were hanging out at park.
We were at date at a party.
We were at a date.

2299
02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:08.330
I think we look at girls mandates.
We were on a mandate.

2300
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:13.220
Scott reaffirmed the haters.
The director.
You're like,

2301
02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:17.270
hey,
is it okay if we were just like slow dancing or or something like that.

2302
02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.300
They kind of talked to us out of it.
That would have been cool.
I know.

2303
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:24.410
I thought it would be cool.
Yeah.
I think they were like,
oh,

2304
02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:25.580
well that would have been rude though.

2305
02:12:25.581 --> 02:12:27.680
We're sending a weird message in the middle of their video.

2306
02:12:27.681 --> 02:12:31.600
That's not our business to do that.
Turn your video.
No.
Gay Porn again.

2307
02:12:31.650 --> 02:12:36.140
Love of fun.
Yeah.
They were at Coachella.
I listened to in my hotel room.

2308
02:12:36.141 --> 02:12:38.930
I was in Fort Lauderdale and in the hotel room.

2309
02:12:38.931 --> 02:12:42.050
I was watching the live Coachella feed on Ustream or youtube rather.

2310
02:12:42.051 --> 02:12:45.920
It's pretty bad ass.
It's great.
You go full screen with it.
It's totally HD.

2311
02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:50.870
It looked amazing.
It was really fun.
Really A,
it was fun to watch their,

2312
02:12:50.871 --> 02:12:53.840
uh,
their fucking killing it out there,
man.
They're going to be back next week.

2313
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:58.300
Are they?
What are they doing this weekend?
Coachella again.
Oh really?
Yeah,

2314
02:12:58.610 --> 02:13:03.050
she was on stage and talking about how Suzanne was that she,

2315
02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.500
the last time she was there,
she was selling barbecue at one of the stands.

2316
02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:10.930
So she was like,
just to let you know,
barbecue is the route to the stage here.

2317
02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.170
Coachella.
She's hot.
She's ridiculously talented,
too.

2318
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:18.330
Ridiculously.
That,
that chick's voice is amazing.
There's,

2319
02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:22.280
so I got into a thing online with some fucking dude on the board.
Just cut.

2320
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:26.870
So Conti about some,
there's this chick named Nicky Balaam,
I think her name is,

2321
02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.140
and she does that.
A rendition of Linda Ronstadt's.

2322
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:32.070
You're no good while inside

2323
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.780
<v 6>of a,
um,
inside of van.
Have you heard it?
You haven't just seen it,</v>

2324
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:39.300
dude.
You gotta you gotta hear this.

2325
02:13:39.301 --> 02:13:41.190
It just put it on for a couple minutes because it's,

2326
02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:44.640
it's them singing this song in a van and this,

2327
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:49.350
this chick has fucking incredible voice.
Just Nikki B,

2328
02:13:49.351 --> 02:13:51.630
l u h m or something like that.

2329
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:54.960
You're no good while you apostrophe.

2330
02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:59.130
What did someone say or armor?
He said some dude was,
oh,

2331
02:13:59.170 --> 02:14:02.970
some dude was shitting on it like,
you know I,
I was saying,
you know,

2332
02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:07.440
how how much talent is chick has.
And some dude was like,
you know,
no,

2333
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:10.150
that soaks it.
Shit.
This is better.
And I,

2334
02:14:10.151 --> 02:14:14.790
I fucking get crazy when people tell me that what you like sucks.
Like why,

2335
02:14:14.791 --> 02:14:18.660
why it does you don't like it.
We can't say it sucks.
It just,

2336
02:14:18.661 --> 02:14:22.800
it's that chicken fucking sing.
It might not be your style in music.

2337
02:14:22.801 --> 02:14:24.970
It might not be something that you would get into my mom.
You,

2338
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:28.320
it might not be in the right frequency to de de de de tune into it.

2339
02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.060
You might not enjoy that kind of music,
but so many people enjoy it.
It's the one,

2340
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:36.470
the upper left.
Oh,
the,
yeah,
the one.
Yeah.
Right.
Nope.
Above it.
Above it.
Okay.

2341
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.060
Are you allowed to play it on your podcast?
Yeah.

2342
02:14:40.061 --> 02:14:41.910
You could play this for a couple seconds.
Check it out.

2343
02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:48.530
<v 8>Why?
Just driving.
I heard this</v>

2344
02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:53.810
chick's voice,
man crying.
Can you move your arm for second

2345
02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.840
through?

2346
02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.940
Yeah,
I see how you

2347
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:14.340
damn that bitch can say,
hey

2348
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:26.310
baby,
I love that voice,
man.
This

2349
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:31.110
<v 6>is awesome.
That's like soulful,
you know that's a smoky,
oh dude,</v>

2350
02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:35.700
it's a,
it's a hot video man.
It's,
it's,
it's really,
it's inspirational too.

2351
02:15:35.701 --> 02:15:39.030
I liked it.
They're on their way to a Gig and they're just playing in a van,

2352
02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:39.511
you know?

2353
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:42.360
And she's just sitting there with an iPhone and recording it and it's beautiful,

2354
02:15:42.361 --> 02:15:44.910
man.
There's not,
there's no special effects.
There's no nothing.

2355
02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:49.710
And it's one of my favorite videos,
man.
I'm,
I'm,
that's a,
I don't know what it is,

2356
02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:54.510
man,
but at chick with a bad ass voice,
it like makes my body feel better.

2357
02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.550
I like it.
It's Susan,
me,

2358
02:15:56.551 --> 02:16:01.140
it puts me into a frame of mind that is almost unavailable to me without like

2359
02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:04.980
being in love with female voices.
I love the female.
It's incredible.

2360
02:16:04.981 --> 02:16:07.710
Rama Glock on,
that's one of my favorite.
Oh Dude.

2361
02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:11.250
I was in a pool hall in fucking White Plains,
New York.

2362
02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:15.180
And that first Sarah Pailin video or set pair,
Sarah Pailin,

2363
02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:19.530
split of the flux at Sarah McLaughlin.
Sarah McLaughlin video came up this sin

2364
02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:27.420
possession.
Yeah.
You know that song.
And I remember looking up and just go,

2365
02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:30.100
God damn.
And the dude was like,

2366
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.890
<v 2>Hey,
come on man,
it's your shot.
I was like,
I don't even want to play anymore.</v>

2367
02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:36.910
I wanted to watch that video.
I was like,
I was hypnotized.
It's like Holy Shit.

2368
02:16:37.090 --> 02:16:41.380
If she kills it every time I've heard time,
I went,
dude,

2369
02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.880
I went to last minute.

2370
02:16:42.881 --> 02:16:47.020
Sarah McLaughlin was playing Hollywood bowl about a year ago,
and I was like,

2371
02:16:47.021 --> 02:16:50.890
I told my girlfriend she's playing tonight.
I didn't even know you want to go.

2372
02:16:50.891 --> 02:16:54.020
It's not sold out.
My Buddy Tom,
he goes,
dude,
it's not sold out.
He reminded me,

2373
02:16:54.030 --> 02:16:56.050
you should go.
So we went to,
showed up,

2374
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.150
did we just show we're just going to buy any tickets?

2375
02:16:58.151 --> 02:16:59.760
And some guy comes up and goes,
you,

2376
02:16:59.761 --> 02:17:02.200
you know anybody who needs to do you need two tickets.

2377
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:05.590
You know they were from work that he got right through like probably

2378
02:17:07.170 --> 02:17:11.220
maybe 20 yards from her right in front of her amazing seats.

2379
02:17:11.221 --> 02:17:13.620
We totally lucked out right there in the front.

2380
02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:15.690
And she destroyed the Hollywood bowl.

2381
02:17:15.930 --> 02:17:17.970
She went out there barefoot and she killed it.

2382
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.660
She has this background center cause you know obviously on record she does a lot

2383
02:17:21.661 --> 02:17:25.620
of layers.
It's like 10 Sarah's sometimes three,
sometimes four.

2384
02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:29.350
It's a choir of her,
but she has his backup singer that sounds just like her.

2385
02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:32.310
She's been with her for years.
Amazing.
She's like a star too.

2386
02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:35.850
She's the chick who makes Sarah sound good cause she's backing her up.

2387
02:17:35.851 --> 02:17:39.060
You know the both amazing man.
It's crazy.

2388
02:17:39.061 --> 02:17:43.320
She's probably like one of the most famous background singers,
you know.
Shit.

2389
02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:48.100
And Sarah Maclaughlin still touring.
She's too,
yeah.
Does she tore a lot?
Fuck.

2390
02:17:48.101 --> 02:17:53.020
She just got divorced.
New Life.
Maybe like a year ago,

2391
02:17:54.650 --> 02:17:58.290
wife was a mom.
I was fumbling,

2392
02:17:58.350 --> 02:18:01.800
fumbling towards ecstasy that I'm fumbling towards ecstasy.

2393
02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:05.650
One of the greatest albums ever.
Man.
That's well possessions on this track.
One.

2394
02:18:05.850 --> 02:18:09.830
That whole album is amazing.
Fumbling towards ecstasy.
Incredible.

2395
02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:15.240
Sane voice.
I really hate that stupid pet commercial though.
Her Song using

2396
02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:20.370
the song you don't like.
Yeah,
I don't like that song.

2397
02:18:20.371 --> 02:18:22.620
It's where there's a lot of songs on that holy that into,

2398
02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.520
I mean some albums she only has one good song,
the whole album,
you know.
Uh,

2399
02:18:26.521 --> 02:18:27.990
but um,

2400
02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:32.280
I still love her cause overall she's got like 15 amazing songs,

2401
02:18:32.281 --> 02:18:35.280
like even surfacing had four or five great songs.

2402
02:18:35.281 --> 02:18:38.910
Are you trying to find out what it looks like?
Brian?
Sarah,
she's still hot.

2403
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:43.100
She gets extra talent points.
Uh,
yeah.

2404
02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:45.990
He used to be so honored to be in her presence,
presence of her vagina.

2405
02:18:45.991 --> 02:18:48.960
If she let you into the fold.
I saw her,
I Valentine's Day.

2406
02:18:48.961 --> 02:18:51.630
Can you imagine you're hanging out and she's like serenading and shit.

2407
02:18:52.350 --> 02:18:54.000
It'd be like a little bitch.
Yeah.

2408
02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:57.840
I bought tickets for my girlfriend to see her on Valentine's Day and like 1998

2409
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:59.370
and it was like the hottest thing ever.

2410
02:19:00.810 --> 02:19:03.960
My girlfriend wasn't really even into Sarah McLaughlin at all until that show.

2411
02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:07.110
She got blown away.
It was at and shit.
She kills everything.

2412
02:19:07.111 --> 02:19:11.420
Her voice is never off.
She's amazing,
effortless,
just you know,

2413
02:19:11.490 --> 02:19:15.840
angelic voice.
Just like some song.
I mean I love the black keys.

2414
02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:19.050
I mean it doesn't have to be a girl singing to get me,

2415
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.830
but does a certain thing that a girl sing and does.
It's a different thing.

2416
02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.560
It's a different,
like girls can do different things,
you know,

2417
02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:30.290
they could do their,
you,
they have a more octaves they could sing and yeah,

2418
02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:35.090
it's just the way it reacts or the Way Your Body rather reacts to the,

2419
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:40.091
the beautiful harmonic sound of a beautiful female voice.

2420
02:19:40.670 --> 02:19:44.690
It's like,
wow,
you know,
your whole body just goes,
wow.
It's amazing thing.

2421
02:19:44.691 --> 02:19:46.100
What sound can do,
dude,

2422
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:50.240
when we think about the information that's being transferred between people,

2423
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:50.931
you know,
the,

2424
02:19:50.931 --> 02:19:54.920
the lyrics and the notes and all of it together and the impact that it has on

2425
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:57.430
your,
your whole body and you're feeling though.

2426
02:19:57.490 --> 02:20:00.950
I mean there's songs that give you goosebumps or songs make you want to run up

2427
02:20:00.951 --> 02:20:05.300
hills.
There's songs that I used to listen to offspring when I uh,

2428
02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:10.100
when I would hit the bag because Austin is like,
everything is like fucking go,

2429
02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:14.300
go.
It's all just inquiry.
It makes you work out harder.

2430
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:16.880
Like you listen to a fucking old offspring album.

2431
02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:18.550
That shit will make you work out hard.

2432
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.690
The pace is so frenetic and makes you just to fucking attack,
attack,
attack.

2433
02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:24.900
There's nothing else that can do that.
No.
A guy standing next to you is,

2434
02:20:24.901 --> 02:20:27.950
I'm going to do that.
Like there's something about music that just like fucking,

2435
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:32.750
we used the band I was in back when I was 18 resistance where speed metal band.

2436
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:36.830
We used to share rehearsal rooms with offspring.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2437
02:20:36.831 --> 02:20:39.410
That was just the leave the room smelling like petroleum oil.

2438
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:43.100
I couldn't believe they got so huge like holy shit.

2439
02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:45.570
We used to practice with these guys.
Wow.
It's amazing.

2440
02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:49.310
Back a DC sparks and off a and Anaheim,

2441
02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:51.710
they have some of my favorite workout music over.

2442
02:20:51.810 --> 02:20:56.630
She's just fucking for going crazy berserker style like for hidden things so

2443
02:20:56.631 --> 02:20:57.550
fast.
We just want,

2444
02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:00.380
if you are going to do rounds on a bag or something and listen to some
offspring,

2445
02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:05.390
it's amazing that that like really good music can make cardio actually like go

2446
02:21:05.391 --> 02:21:08.780
buy.
Like if you put on like a fucking Badass.
Um,

2447
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.570
specially if you smoke a little weed and a lot of people think that that's

2448
02:21:11.571 --> 02:21:16.150
counterproductive to cardio work.
But I say,
how dare you look at Nick ideas.
Yeah.

2449
02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:16.993
Look at Nick Diaz.

2450
02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:23.100
You is still alive and kicking Nick Diaz Braulio Schema.
Holy Shit.

2451
02:21:23.101 --> 02:21:24.590
Oh,
that's going to be May 12th,
right?

2452
02:21:24.591 --> 02:21:28.850
May 13th May 12th May 12th May 12th where's that,
that fight?
It's uh,
there's no,

2453
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:32.450
there's a world Jujitsu expo happening in Los Angeles.
I'm not,

2454
02:21:32.451 --> 02:21:33.920
I think in Long Beach or something.

2455
02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:39.100
I'm not sure either la convention or at Long Beach May 12th World Jujitsu Expo

2456
02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:42.680
and there's going to be a few super fights.

2457
02:21:42.681 --> 02:21:46.790
A lot of top Jiu Jitsu guys are doing seminars like Robert Drysdale,

2458
02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:49.040
I think Andrea vows doing a drug,

2459
02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:54.350
all the big dudes and broadly steamer who is arguably the best pound for pound

2460
02:21:54.351 --> 02:21:57.840
Jujitsu guy on the planet.
Him and Marcello right up there.
Um,

2461
02:21:57.890 --> 02:22:02.690
he's going against Nick Diaz match.
Do you know Bruce met a couple times?

2462
02:22:02.691 --> 02:22:04.940
He's been totally go on.
A fucking great guy hears.

2463
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:07.790
Did you even know with him in England?
Yeah.
Oh Shit.

2464
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.850
[inaudible] he was recently some translating over there a couple of times we

2465
02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:14.510
hung out with him.
He's a great guy.
He's a great good.
So down to earth.

2466
02:22:14.511 --> 02:22:15.920
Such a really nice guy.
Like if you were,

2467
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:18.350
we were hanging around talking behind a backstage,

2468
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:21.530
like at the lands and one of the shows.
If you didn't know him,
man,
you would,

2469
02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:24.470
you would never assume that this guy is one of the baddest motherfuckers on

2470
02:22:24.471 --> 02:22:25.770
earth when it comes Jujitsu.

2471
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.600
<v 6>He just seems so friendly and easy going and so on.</v>

2472
02:22:28.601 --> 02:22:31.710
Assuming he's going to do it for that as well.
Wow.
Dude.

2473
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:35.580
He's gonna fuck some people up,
man.
That Jujitsu is nasty.

2474
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:40.500
He's so technical.
So,
so what do you think Nec Braulio who knows?

2475
02:22:40.501 --> 02:22:44.960
It's going to be awesome.
I would never say,
even if I thought,
listen,

2476
02:22:44.970 --> 02:22:48.420
tell you something,
man.
Nick Diaz is the opening to my podcast,

2477
02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:52.890
so I'll never say anything bad about nick tells probably us to meet steam as a

2478
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:55.200
motherfucker,
but shows you how ballsy he has is.

2479
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:58.440
He's not just taking a super fight against anybody taking a super fight against

2480
02:22:58.650 --> 02:23:02.040
the best.
I mean,
he's just jumping in and doing,

2481
02:23:02.370 --> 02:23:05.640
having an opportunity where he could get submitted,
you know,
easily.

2482
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:07.860
He might shock the world.
Can you never know,

2483
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:11.000
could you imagine that they'd like Triangle Braulio?
Can you imagine?

2484
02:23:11.020 --> 02:23:15.300
Imagine that would be,
especially if it was high as Jesus on a space shuttle,

2485
02:23:15.301 --> 02:23:19.860
that would definitely make ESPN.
Definitely.
That's going to get so much coverage.

2486
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:23.980
Nick Diaz is a fucking UFC rockstar.
Yeah,

2487
02:23:24.090 --> 02:23:27.120
he's going to do a super fight.
No one.
They never any man,

2488
02:23:27.121 --> 02:23:29.730
you know he liked locked Makoko.
He finished Makoko.

2489
02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:32.820
You know Nick Diaz can finish anyway,
if anybody sleeps on Nick Diaz,

2490
02:23:32.821 --> 02:23:35.820
he can do the biggest Jujitsu match of all time.
I think.
So.

2491
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:39.140
This is the biggest Jujitsu.
You have a salt.
Yeah.

2492
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:43.050
Because a lot of people and thought that Nick Diaz should've got the nod in that

2493
02:23:43.051 --> 02:23:46.380
fight against Carlos condit.
So that would make him,
in their opinion.

2494
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:49.000
And that's not just a few,
you know,
I don't,
I,

2495
02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.450
I've said I thought he could have won,
but I could see the,

2496
02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:53.310
I could see how you could scored for Carlos to,

2497
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:55.230
I will if I would have leaned towards nick.

2498
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:58.020
But it was a very fucking close fight.
Just say it was a draw.

2499
02:23:58.021 --> 02:24:01.290
Let's pretend it was a draw or even just a close loss.

2500
02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:06.320
You're talking about one of the very best guys in MMA going up against the very

2501
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:10.700
best car,
one of the very best guys in Jujitsu.
That never happens.
Never.
Never.

2502
02:24:10.701 --> 02:24:14.440
This is the biggest Jujitsu Strikeforce champion.
I mean,
when was the last time,

2503
02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:17.790
I mean,
George Saint Pierre jumped in and fought novel dobby and what was it,

2504
02:24:17.791 --> 02:24:22.590
2003 five five 2005 yeah.
Right.
It was La,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

2505
02:24:22.591 --> 02:24:26.100
and he jumped in there too.
He wasn't as famous.
It wasn't as famous,

2506
02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:30.840
not as Nick Diaz is right now.
MMA wasn't as big.
This was all pre a ultimate.
No,

2507
02:24:30.841 --> 02:24:35.100
it wasn't was it?
That's what a lot of balls and from GSP,
he said,
fuck it.

2508
02:24:35.101 --> 02:24:37.950
I'm doing Abu Dhabi GSPS.
He's another guy.
Look at it.

2509
02:24:37.951 --> 02:24:40.470
Look how fucking Nice that guy.
He goes,
yeah,
I remember hanging out with him.

2510
02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:45.330
He's the nicest guy ever.
Just such a sweetheart and so unassuming.

2511
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:47.370
Again,
same thing,
so completely unassuming.

2512
02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:50.370
The fact that he would even allow me to teach him a kick,

2513
02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:54.060
that he would waste his time to come down to the gym to work out with me.

2514
02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:57.340
You know,
there's just a that he would even try that you know?

2515
02:24:57.370 --> 02:25:01.650
It just shows you what a nice guy.
You know how crazy that video is?
No crazy.

2516
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:04.650
Here.
Here we got George Saint Pierre,

2517
02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.670
the Michael Jordan of MMA.
MMA is the hottest sport on the planet.

2518
02:25:08.671 --> 02:25:12.240
UFC is the biggest sport on the planet,
or hottest rising.

2519
02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:15.780
Here's George Saint Pierre taking,

2520
02:25:16.290 --> 02:25:21.070
spinning back kick lessons from you on video.

2521
02:25:21.370 --> 02:25:23.860
Even Bruce lead that can't,
doesn't have like that.

2522
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:28.540
<v 1>There's no Bruce leave video footage of Bruce showing the baddest fighter on the</v>

2523
02:25:28.541 --> 02:25:32.590
planet how to kick.
Well,
this is what I'm saying.
You know,
look,
I'm not,

2524
02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:33.940
there's a lot of things that I'm not that good.

2525
02:25:33.941 --> 02:25:37.630
I'm just saying that video is fucking historic.
Oh yeah.

2526
02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:39.760
<v 6>What I'm saying is there's not a lot of things that I'm,
I'm,</v>

2527
02:25:39.761 --> 02:25:41.150
I'm not good at a lot of things,

2528
02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:45.170
but there's a few things I'm really good at and I'm really good at kicking shit.

2529
02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:49.670
I can kick shit hard and that's something I've done since I was a little kid.

2530
02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:53.570
I've been throwing taekwondo kicks in,
so it's growing.

2531
02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:58.160
<v 1>This is,
my body was growing and before youtube,
before the,
you know,</v>

2532
02:25:58.170 --> 02:26:02.130
the Internet where it is today,
I knew how hard you kicked man.

2533
02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:04.440
I was trying to tell people no one would believe me.

2534
02:26:04.441 --> 02:26:08.100
I would say do Joe Rogan kicks harder than anybody I've ever seen.

2535
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:12.060
And they're like,
whatever,
whatever.
Nobody believed that.
God dammit.

2536
02:26:12.270 --> 02:26:13.103
It's one of those things.

2537
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:15.970
<v 6>Anybody that just develops,
if you like,</v>

2538
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:19.890
spend 10 years working on one specific thing,
like,

2539
02:26:19.891 --> 02:26:23.010
look how good Marcello Garcia has.
We're naked.
Choke is,
you know why?

2540
02:26:23.011 --> 02:26:26.220
Cause he just hit that over and over and over again to put those numbers.

2541
02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:29.910
If you look at the way Jimmy Hendrix used to play guitar,

2542
02:26:29.911 --> 02:26:31.410
why could he play guitar so good?

2543
02:26:31.411 --> 02:26:35.340
Because he just hit those numbers over and over and over and over and it became

2544
02:26:35.341 --> 02:26:36.210
a part of his body.

2545
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:40.980
The thing you can learn about someone throwing a crazy spinning back kick is

2546
02:26:40.981 --> 02:26:45.960
what's possible when someone just dedicates insane hours to one technique over

2547
02:26:45.961 --> 02:26:46.860
and over and over again.

2548
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:51.690
So my hands were fucking terrible dude until I was like 20 years old.

2549
02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:55.530
I had no boxing technique at all.
I didn't develop my hands.

2550
02:26:55.650 --> 02:26:58.980
I learned how to throw straight punches and I learned how to throw hooks.

2551
02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:02.850
But when I would box with people,
I would get killed my fucking up.

2552
02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.170
My hands are always down low.

2553
02:27:04.171 --> 02:27:06.180
My Chin was up too high and get punched in the face.

2554
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.790
I still a box and my friend Mike Blight,
he was a,

2555
02:27:08.791 --> 02:27:11.160
a former professional boxer and he used to beat me up.

2556
02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.530
He was fucking make me not be able to kick them.

2557
02:27:13.531 --> 02:27:15.360
And just put the gloves on me just kicked my ass.

2558
02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:19.410
I didn't really know how to use my hands cause all that time was just spent

2559
02:27:19.411 --> 02:27:21.450
developing kicks,
developing kicks,

2560
02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:25.020
but when you're trying to be like a martial arts superstar like George Saint

2561
02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:28.440
Pierre of mixed martial arts guy,
mixed martial arts and choir,

2562
02:27:28.441 --> 02:27:31.720
so many different skills.
You've got to work on your wrestling,

2563
02:27:31.721 --> 02:27:32.700
you're going to work on this,

2564
02:27:32.701 --> 02:27:36.390
you've got to work on that to develop one technique that takes an incredible

2565
02:27:36.391 --> 02:27:40.380
amount of time to get really proficient at like it was spinning crazy kicks.

2566
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:45.150
Those take a long time before you really develop that full body coordination

2567
02:27:45.330 --> 02:27:45.900
like that.

2568
02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:49.710
The moves in the 360 degree roundhouse kick when you step and run at somebody,

2569
02:27:49.770 --> 02:27:52.190
those are just like tying a shoe lace.
It just,

2570
02:27:52.191 --> 02:27:56.010
it sinks into place where it just becomes a part of your life.
I don't think,

2571
02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:56.341
okay,

2572
02:27:56.341 --> 02:27:58.620
now I'm going to step with the left and then I'm going to pivot on the ball of

2573
02:27:58.621 --> 02:28:01.890
my foot and then put the heel down and then lift the knee up and then kick.

2574
02:28:01.891 --> 02:28:06.540
I don't even think that.
I just don't just don't do it like you do.
When you,

2575
02:28:06.541 --> 02:28:09.090
when you hit that twist or role,
how many times you hit that twist her role.

2576
02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:12.630
When you're inside control and you hooked that left foot under your knee,

2577
02:28:12.631 --> 02:28:15.990
just just go for a ride.
It's just a part of your body.

2578
02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:18.780
It's a part of the way you know your,
your,
your,
your,

2579
02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:22.880
your body interacts with this universe,
you,
it,
it's ingrained in you.

2580
02:28:22.881 --> 02:28:27.860
It's a path that's grooved in Warren.
So smooth.
It just automatically goes,

2581
02:28:27.861 --> 02:28:30.950
you're executive producing and you're not making the commands no more.

2582
02:28:30.951 --> 02:28:34.300
You're just overseeing shit.
Yeah.
It was not a weird feeling,
man.
When you just,

2583
02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.090
especially what you did to what's happening too quick for you to even think,

2584
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:40.690
but all of a sudden you,
you got someone's back.
You know,

2585
02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:45.470
there's just been this mad scramble of adjusting positions in everything you've

2586
02:28:45.471 --> 02:28:45.861
done.

2587
02:28:45.861 --> 02:28:50.150
It's been completely on training and everything he'd done has been on repetition

2588
02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:55.190
and drilling and,
and just putting in the numbers.
And so then while you're alive,

2589
02:28:55.191 --> 02:28:58.610
while you're actually rolling to mad scramble habits and your hooks go in and,

2590
02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:01.130
and you got a person's back,
you don't even know what you did.

2591
02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:02.810
You don't even know what you did.
You barely know what you did.

2592
02:29:02.811 --> 02:29:06.920
You just sort of did it.
Yup.
It's crazy.
Same thing with playing guitar or piano,

2593
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:09.830
any shredding on piano.
They're not making any commands.

2594
02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:12.920
They're just kind of executive producing the project.
They're like,

2595
02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:17.450
let's play that thing.
It's a producer's takeover.
That inside unknown producer.

2596
02:29:17.650 --> 02:29:20.900
Yeah.
Creativity is such a fucking amazing thing,
man.

2597
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:23.090
The ability to come up with something that wasn't there.

2598
02:29:24.010 --> 02:29:27.950
That's what a weird thing that is that so satisfying.
You know,

2599
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:29.360
and I know you feel it,
Brian.
I mean,

2600
02:29:29.361 --> 02:29:32.180
that's how Brian and I met because Brian would just make everybody laugh.

2601
02:29:32.181 --> 02:29:35.570
These silly fucking videos he would put online,
you know?

2602
02:29:35.571 --> 02:29:38.780
But you know that when you're putting something like that out there and then

2603
02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:42.440
somebody reacts to it and somebody likes it and boom,
it's just like to up,

2604
02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:44.030
you know,
getting good at something,

2605
02:29:44.031 --> 02:29:46.880
creating something good that gets recognized as something good and creating

2606
02:29:46.881 --> 02:29:48.560
something good where it,
while you're doing it,

2607
02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:51.770
it's sort of just playing out and then,
oh,
there it is.
Now it's done.

2608
02:29:54.270 --> 02:29:58.020
<v 2>I guess everybody's ran out of gas and to this God damn pocket.</v>

2609
02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:04.020
So we learned a lot today,
ladies and gentlemen.
We learned about positivity,

2610
02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:06.330
positive experiences.
What I love,

2611
02:30:07.170 --> 02:30:11.110
what I want to say is after that world Jujitsu Expo,
yes,

2612
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:13.110
that night and Hollywood,

2613
02:30:13.410 --> 02:30:17.010
I'm having my birthday party at Bardot and Hollywood.

2614
02:30:17.011 --> 02:30:21.210
It's on vine,
like a block north of Hollywood boulevard,

2615
02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:25.830
Bardo.
My band smoked,
smoked serpents plan.
No cover.

2616
02:30:25.831 --> 02:30:28.350
Just say you're no cover.
That's crazy.

2617
02:30:28.351 --> 02:30:30.690
You just saw that on the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

2618
02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:33.900
You're going to have what they call packets.
Do you know what a packet is?

2619
02:30:33.930 --> 02:30:36.390
What does that,
that's what the people in my message board called Po.

2620
02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:39.600
It's a mixture of podcast and faggot and so they call them packets.

2621
02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:45.120
Well,
it's real snow cover.
If you said he was there for my birthday party,

2622
02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:48.630
well that's ridiculous,
dude.
You're going to get a,
it's going to be overwhelmed.

2623
02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:50.970
I'm not even remember to come.
I'm not gonna be able to fit in there.

2624
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.280
It's going to be stuffed by the time we get there.
I doubt it.

2625
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:56.250
There'll be like 12 people there just fucked up,
son.
You just fucked up.

2626
02:30:56.251 --> 02:30:57.940
So I put a high ticket every once.

2627
02:30:57.950 --> 02:31:01.500
A weird dudes with weird colds are going to want to shake your hand.

2628
02:31:02.530 --> 02:31:06.310
No Shit,
no shot.
It'd be cool after that World Expo out,

2629
02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:09.230
you go watch Nick Diaz and Brawley esteem.
I'll go home,
take a shower,

2630
02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:13.430
go get something to eat,
then meet me for my birthday bash at Bardot.

2631
02:31:13.431 --> 02:31:17.790
Smoked Serpent's going to rock goddamn house.
10th Planet J j.com.

2632
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:19.830
All my Jujitsu is there.
Click.

2633
02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:22.560
I'm thinking about being a backup dancer for this event.

2634
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:25.140
I'm thinking about going and dragging in a bag of them down.

2635
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:26.610
So it'd be like a body builder.

2636
02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:30.550
We need bodybuilders instead of blonde wig instead of strippers just oil.

2637
02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:32.910
This oil,
I'm going to shave everything.

2638
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:36.720
I'm just going to shave my legs for the first time ever.
Shave everything.

2639
02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:37.980
Just go up there.
All oil up.

2640
02:31:38.730 --> 02:31:42.890
Where's my manic and close some of your mannequin clothes I've been buying.
Yeah.

2641
02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:44.400
You got a lot of glare,
dude.

2642
02:31:44.401 --> 02:31:46.920
That fucking Linda Blair you sent me that thing looks dope.

2643
02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:49.950
Extra Sister Linda Blair mechanical extra system.

2644
02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:53.580
It got shipped out yesterday or today or something like that.
Oh,
I'm so jealous.

2645
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:55.440
I have to get an American Werewolf in London one.

2646
02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:58.710
I got a Predator one from that dude who you know who came to the UFC.

2647
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.630
You've got to
no,
no,
no.
That's,
that's ridiculous.
Expensive,

2648
02:32:03.631 --> 02:32:06.030
but they do recreation's the American Werewolf in London.

2649
02:32:06.031 --> 02:32:10.360
They do a recreation of it.
It's just big fucking on all fours.
Eddie Bauer.

2650
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:13.760
Don't give a shit about that stuff,
Huh?
It's all good.
We were surprised.

2651
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:16.840
We all have different tastes and if anybody wants to learn some Jujitsu,

2652
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:19.860
you went to come to Hollywood.
My friend and Linda don't put the choke in.

2653
02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:22.800
You'll come to legends,
legends in Hollywood.
I'm,
I'm back.

2654
02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:25.890
My numbness has completely gone.
I've been a wreck for months,
man.

2655
02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:29.770
I fucked up and pulled a muscle in my back.
And you know,
I,
the,

2656
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:32.220
one of the things that happens in Jujitsu,
Jujitsu is so fun.

2657
02:32:32.221 --> 02:32:34.660
Then when you get injured,
you don't think,
man,
I've got to stop doing it.
You did.

2658
02:32:34.661 --> 02:32:37.920
So you just think,
wow,
how long ago have to wait before I can do Jujitsu again.

2659
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:40.920
He'll my shit back up.
So I'll be there soon.

2660
02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:44.790
And that's a legends in Hollywood is on Santa Monica Boulevard and it's east of

2661
02:32:44.791 --> 02:32:49.500
the one on one.
The address is 51 76 Santa Monica Boulevard.

2662
02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:52.440
Enter on Kingsley.
It's called legends MMA.

2663
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:55.860
That's what 10th planet headquarters is located.
Also,

2664
02:32:55.861 --> 02:33:00.020
I got 30 locations worldwide,

Dot.

PHOENIX,

2668
02:33:13.591 --> 02:33:16.140
something like that.
I got El Paso coming up.

2669
02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:19.770
Just go to the Nibiru forum at 10th Planet J J.
Dot Com.

2670
02:33:19.771 --> 02:33:22.950
That's where all the seminar info is.
Phoenix's first though,

2671
02:33:22.951 --> 02:33:26.280
two weeks when you have something,
we'll serve a snake.

2672
02:33:26.281 --> 02:33:29.250
Smoked serpent rather have something that people can buy.
Oh,

2673
02:33:29.251 --> 02:33:33.170
you can go on iTunes.
You buy right now.
Yeah,
you can go on iTunes and um,

2674
02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:37.290
the Song Jujitsu,
which you could also,
there's a video for if you go to youtube,

2675
02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:41.220
search to Jujitsu,
smoke serpent.
We've got it.
We've got a video up.
Uh,

2676
02:33:41.250 --> 02:33:45.660
dropped and Jujitsu are both available on iTunes.
Now.

2677
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:48.810
You eventually going to put like a full CD out?
Yes,
yes.

2678
02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:53.640
Track at a time as we finish him,
you know,
so all right.
My brother,
as always,

2679
02:33:53.730 --> 02:33:54.361
big time phone.

2680
02:33:54.361 --> 02:33:57.870
We didn't even get a chance to talk about Jon Jones and Rashad Evans.
Fuck,

2681
02:33:57.871 --> 02:34:01.020
I'm going to have to go with John Jones.
Man.
I think he's just too much.

2682
02:34:01.050 --> 02:34:04.110
He could get caught.
Rashad does have power.
He does have a speed.

2683
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:06.510
He does have explosiveness.
He,
I,
you know,

2684
02:34:06.511 --> 02:34:09.210
we might say John John's just collapse and drop.
I want big bomb,

2685
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:13.800
but my money's on John Jones.
I think he's going to be cautious.
I think,
uh,

2686
02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:17.890
I think he's gonna out Wrestle Rashad and really beat him up on the ground.
Wow.

2687
02:34:17.891 --> 02:34:18.130
That'd

2688
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.460
<v 6>be amazing to see because Michelle looked amazing against Phil Davis,</v>

2689
02:34:21.461 --> 02:34:25.270
especially in the scrambles wound up on top of virtually every time,
you know,

2690
02:34:25.271 --> 02:34:28.680
and his standup was just Phil Davis couldn't handle the stand up.
He was,

2691
02:34:28.690 --> 02:34:32.620
Rashad was good.
It was,
he looked really solid.
And before that finished off Tito.

2692
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:34.420
And I don't think we shots pretty underrated.

2693
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:36.340
And I think one of the things that you got to think,

2694
02:34:36.370 --> 02:34:37.800
you've got to take into consideration as a fact,

2695
02:34:37.801 --> 02:34:40.030
they trained a lot together so they both get to know each of these little

2696
02:34:40.031 --> 02:34:42.950
idiosyncrasies and I'm sure each of them have,
uh,

2697
02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:44.980
taken into consideration and adjusted,

2698
02:34:45.010 --> 02:34:48.190
but it's going to be fascinating to see what each one knows about each one.

2699
02:34:48.490 --> 02:34:51.200
You know,
I know there was,
uh,
some moments that,
uh,

2700
02:34:51.201 --> 02:34:54.300
they had talked about where were shot and had success in training,
you know,

2701
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:57.600
with John was tired and he was holding them down like they made reference to

2702
02:34:57.601 --> 02:34:58.434
this many times.

2703
02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:02.500
So it's gonna be interesting to see how much John has progressed since then

2704
02:35:02.501 --> 02:35:05.890
because if you look at the way he fights fucking guys like every time you see

2705
02:35:05.891 --> 02:35:10.730
him he's like this newer,
better version,
more confident,
more and more relaxed.

2706
02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:12.460
Total destruction,
destruction.

2707
02:35:12.461 --> 02:35:16.510
I mean the way he strangled with Leo Machida and then just dropped him down

2708
02:35:16.511 --> 02:35:19.210
there.
I mean that's their common opponent.
Right.
And you know,

2709
02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.710
Machida of course was the first guy to,
not the only condominium owner.

2710
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:24.910
They felt rampage as well.

2711
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.360
But Machida was the first guy and the only guy in the UFC to beat Rashad.

2712
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:32.320
Rashad won the ultimate fighter is a fucking heavyweight and then dropped down

2713
02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:35.260
to light heavyweight and he's still one of the smaller light heavyweights,

2714
02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:39.400
you know,
I think,
uh,
he's a dangerous guy for anybody at two oh five.

2715
02:35:39.401 --> 02:35:42.910
And I think knowing as much as he knows about Jon Jones is going to be really

2716
02:35:42.911 --> 02:35:46.810
fascinating.
Really interesting to see because John is so,
he's,

2717
02:35:47.090 --> 02:35:49.660
he looks like a Muhammad Ali right now.
You know what I mean?

2718
02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:52.090
He looks like a Mike Tyson.
He looks like a sugar ray Leonard.

2719
02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:54.730
When he was in his prime,
he looks like one of these dudes is like,
man,

2720
02:35:54.731 --> 02:35:57.670
this dude is just going to start dominating the world.
You know,

2721
02:35:57.671 --> 02:35:59.080
he's already dominating the world.

2722
02:35:59.081 --> 02:36:02.580
He's already destroying shogun and willing to title and,
and,
and,

2723
02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:06.730
and taking out rampage and taking out Machida and putting them to sleep.
I mean,

2724
02:36:06.970 --> 02:36:10.600
he's just on another level,
man.
He's on another level and it looks like he's,

2725
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:13.180
what is he 24 or something like that?
How old is he?

2726
02:36:13.570 --> 02:36:16.420
He's the youngest guy to ever win the UFC title.
I mean,
I,

2727
02:36:16.421 --> 02:36:20.740
I don't think he's even 24 maybe is what if you are in a coma the last fucking

2728
02:36:20.741 --> 02:36:24.760
five years and you woke up and people were trying to fill you in on this John

2729
02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.010
Jones guy and they were just telling you exactly what you just said.

2730
02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.370
All the guys that he totally went right through and destroy credible,

2731
02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.240
he would be blown away.
Yeah,
I'd be completely,
he's 24 yeah,

2732
02:36:34.241 --> 02:36:38.170
he's 24 24 years old and just every time you see him you're seeing it just a

2733
02:36:38.171 --> 02:36:39.100
giant leap.

2734
02:36:39.101 --> 02:36:42.820
And it's progress that age when you're really young like that caught Dami can

2735
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:47.290
learn quick.
God Damn.
When you're fully dedicated and as intelligent as he is,

2736
02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.460
it's going to be interesting to see how good he gets.
It tends to cause most,

2737
02:36:51.610 --> 02:36:52.990
most MMA fighters,

2738
02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:57.280
they get to a point and once they become famous there they're Jujitsu kind of

2739
02:36:57.281 --> 02:36:58.510
plateaus.
You don't see,

2740
02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:02.650
you don't see guys famous guys in the UFC all of a sudden get amazing with their

2741
02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:06.400
Jujitsu.
They kind of plateau,
wants to become famous,
but John Jones,

2742
02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:09.400
he hasn't plateaued yet.
It's just,
it looks better and better.

2743
02:37:09.410 --> 02:37:13.870
And when he gets really good,
like Marcello good and he can,

2744
02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:17.270
he's,
he's a bad motherfucker.
He can.
But you know what?

2745
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.380
I'm really curious to see how they match up.
Really curious to see what happens.

2746
02:37:21.381 --> 02:37:25.310
I think this is going to be so fascinating because obviously Rashad acted as

2747
02:37:25.311 --> 02:37:29.340
some sort of a mentor to John in the beginning.
It's very obvious,
you know,

2748
02:37:29.341 --> 02:37:33.320
and there's,
there's,
it's,
there's so much history.
It's,
and they're so good.

2749
02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:36.320
I think like stylistically Rashad's the most dangerous guy for,

2750
02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:39.380
for Jon Jones right now.
And if he gets through Joe,
if he gets through Rashad,

2751
02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:42.500
then the big question becomes what does he do now?
Does he go to,
I mean,

2752
02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:45.650
who does he going to fight it to?
A five now maybe Gustafson cause dust,

2753
02:37:45.651 --> 02:37:48.320
customs and just look really good with Thiago Silva.
You know,

2754
02:37:48.321 --> 02:37:50.930
he could fight some guys,
but there's no like one standout guy.

2755
02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:54.200
Maybe Dan Henderson.
Dan Henderson stands out.
That's a,

2756
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:55.820
Dan Henderson said he wants a title shot.

2757
02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:00.140
He'll fight like Anderson at 85 or he'll fight Jon Jones two oh five I think he

2758
02:38:00.141 --> 02:38:02.240
prefers to fight at two oh five that could be interesting.

2759
02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:05.610
Henderson's a fucking beast,
man.
You can't count him out with anybody.
Yeah.

2760
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:08.000
Henderson's scary dude.
And you know what,

2761
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:12.830
who knows maybe fade or it goes to two oh five maybe he came back to him cut up

2762
02:38:12.831 --> 02:38:14.570
at two oh five I would,
yeah.

2763
02:38:14.590 --> 02:38:16.910
What you guys are just too big from like big foot was just too big for him.

2764
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.330
He just couldn't handle it.
And you know,
the Dan Henderson fight shit,

2765
02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.940
most people lose the Dan Henderson and he was in it,
you know?

2766
02:38:22.941 --> 02:38:25.350
And it wasn't I think fade or still in the mix,
man.
I,

2767
02:38:25.351 --> 02:38:29.770
but I think he really needs to start training and eating right and get down at

2768
02:38:29.771 --> 02:38:32.980
two oh five and dominate there.
Yeah.
Well he's,

2769
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:35.660
he's certainly got still nasty skills on his feet.

2770
02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:37.520
His submissions have always been great.

2771
02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:40.520
It just doesn't seem like he fights with the same sort of passion that he used

2772
02:38:40.521 --> 02:38:43.370
to have for it.
I think it's inevitable.
A certain guys,

2773
02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.310
they have a certain amount of time in this game and after a while it's just,

2774
02:38:46.580 --> 02:38:48.650
you know,
you hear him talk about it and he says,
you know,

2775
02:38:48.651 --> 02:38:53.510
it's God's will and this is really more into religion these days then than he

2776
02:38:53.511 --> 02:38:56.480
is,
I think into going out and fucking people up,
you know?

2777
02:38:56.481 --> 02:38:59.860
So I've always been a fade or fan,
you know,

2778
02:38:59.861 --> 02:39:02.720
I thought the days when he was dominating and pride,

2779
02:39:02.721 --> 02:39:06.410
he means one of the most exciting guys in the world.
Watch.
It was amazing man.

2780
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.070
But all fighters,
they go through a cycle of the,
the greatest of all time.

2781
02:39:10.071 --> 02:39:13.710
They all go through a cycle where they're almost unbeatable and after awhile

2782
02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:17.300
there's some deterioration or the talent pool increases,

2783
02:39:17.301 --> 02:39:20.360
which is one of the things that I,
I certainly think happened in the UFC.

2784
02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:20.810
You know,

2785
02:39:20.810 --> 02:39:25.460
I think the talent pool has gotten bigger and bigger and reseal over doom that

2786
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:28.850
the first loss.
You just cannot fuck around for breezy over dooms guard.

2787
02:39:28.851 --> 02:39:32.780
You can't,
you can't,
you can't get play.
You can't play cute with that dude.

2788
02:39:32.781 --> 02:39:36.920
He just locks your shit up.
When I talked to,
um,
Ryan Parsons about Fabrizio,

2789
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:38.260
when he talks about how king,

2790
02:39:38.261 --> 02:39:40.710
Mo and mayhem and all those guys were training with breeze you,

2791
02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:42.500
he said none of the ground and pound works,

2792
02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:44.790
none of it for research just moves you around,

2793
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:48.840
just puts butterfly hooks in on you,
moves you around.
They can't handle.

2794
02:39:48.841 --> 02:39:50.450
And they can,
they can't beat him up on the ground.

2795
02:39:50.451 --> 02:39:51.740
He's just too fucking dangerous.

2796
02:39:51.890 --> 02:39:56.030
That debt have you wait long build with a sick guard like he has.

2797
02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:59.330
If anybody gets on top of that guy,
when they're on your good luck,

2798
02:39:59.450 --> 02:40:01.370
you're in a fucking terrible situation.

2799
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:04.670
That guy on his back and you're on top of him and you're fucked.

2800
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:08.030
You're in a bad spot unless he's tired because overing within his guard.

2801
02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:11.840
That's true.
He was really tired and is not really human size.

2802
02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:14.400
What's the latest with Overeem?
Um,

2803
02:40:14.430 --> 02:40:18.480
they say they have some reason for why he tested over a certain number and they

2804
02:40:18.481 --> 02:40:21.270
also say that the number he tested,
um,

2805
02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:25.590
may not have been accurate as this,
as the rumors.
This is everything,
by the way,

2806
02:40:25.591 --> 02:40:27.920
is completely hearsay that I'm saying.
Um,

2807
02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:31.260
I didn't have any direct from Overeem information.

2808
02:40:31.650 --> 02:40:36.090
Some people believe that he is going to be able to be licensed to fight and that

2809
02:40:36.091 --> 02:40:40.410
they'll,
I don't know.
We're going to find out on April 24th and April 24th.

2810
02:40:40.411 --> 02:40:42.570
That's when he has his,
uh,
his hearing.

2811
02:40:42.571 --> 02:40:46.380
I don't know if the commission makes a decision on the same day.
I think they do,

2812
02:40:46.381 --> 02:40:48.030
but I'm not sure.
Um,

2813
02:40:48.090 --> 02:40:52.350
but then we'll probably find out what the fuck they decided to do.
Um,

2814
02:40:52.370 --> 02:40:55.380
and what the situation is.
Exactly.
If it's something he took,

2815
02:40:55.381 --> 02:40:59.400
if something's not true,
if it's a mistake,
it was tainted sample.

2816
02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:04.410
I don't know,
man.
I don't know.
But you know,
I mean,

2817
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:07.950
if you're going to look at a guy that you would think that might be using

2818
02:41:07.951 --> 02:41:09.180
something that makes you look awesome.

2819
02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:13.700
How about the most awesome looking body in the history of the world?
I mean,

2820
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:17.700
who's got a better look at body that Overeem Cindy Crawford and Meg Ryan for

2821
02:41:17.710 --> 02:41:22.470
girls.
For Girls?
Yeah.
Don't you think?
Oh Man,
I had a back garage.

2822
02:41:22.471 --> 02:41:25.770
No fighters had a boy.
If she,
she was hot when she was young.

2823
02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:29.190
Had a professional fighters.
Who's got a better about it then over him?
Nobody.

2824
02:41:29.730 --> 02:41:32.610
I like Sam's doubt.
Do you like that?
He's got a buddy as well.

2825
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:35.190
It was as big as over him.
He'd be equally impressive.

2826
02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:37.410
Vladimir Klitschko was on the flight.

2827
02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:41.250
The flight from a Fort Lauderdale sat right next to the Dunkin.
Holy Shit.

2828
02:41:41.251 --> 02:41:44.520
Is that guy big?
Whew.
He's the heavyweight champion and one of them,

2829
02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:45.331
the two brothers,

2830
02:41:45.331 --> 02:41:47.880
you know there's two white guys or the heavyweight champions right now.

2831
02:41:48.330 --> 02:41:53.190
We live in a fucking crazy world.
Two white guys who are doctors.
They have PhDs.

2832
02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.820
How dead is that?
Heavyweight division and boxing,

2833
02:41:55.821 --> 02:41:58.440
so how much their man and just David,
nothing.
He's,

2834
02:41:58.450 --> 02:42:01.880
he's big in Europe and has a couple other guys,
but no coach coach,

2835
02:42:01.881 --> 02:42:03.420
just boxing everybody's fucking face on.

2836
02:42:03.421 --> 02:42:08.220
When was the last time we had a heavyweight paper view?
That's a good question.

2837
02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:11.520
I get Klitschko coach go.
I think as paper reviews.
I don't know.
Maybe.

2838
02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:12.770
Maybe he doesn't.
Maybe just fights.

2839
02:42:12.930 --> 02:42:15.780
I know he's huge in Germany because he lives in Germany,

2840
02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:18.420
speaks like I fucking a hundred different languages or something.
Shit.

2841
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:20.070
He's a super genius.

2842
02:42:20.071 --> 02:42:23.280
He was playing chess on his iPad all the way back from Fort Lauderdale.

2843
02:42:23.281 --> 02:42:27.810
Kimbo might be the heavyweight champion.
Kymeta and Kemp Kimbo against Klitschko.

2844
02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:30.990
Come on.
Did you see?
A lot of people think that his last fight was a dive.

2845
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:33.770
Have you seen all the criticism online?
I didn't even pay attention.

2846
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:37.350
The guy came online that fought them and defended himself and made a lot of

2847
02:42:37.351 --> 02:42:39.720
sense to me.
I mean,
sometimes people just get caught and it looks,

2848
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:40.620
it looks like a dive,

2849
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.560
but it's just you're tired and you get clipped on the jaw and your shit just

2850
02:42:43.561 --> 02:42:45.390
goes.
It gives out on your,
it is possible,

2851
02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:48.060
but there's also a lot of dives out there in this world.

2852
02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:50.520
A dude right now is a perfect time for Kimbo.

2853
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:54.400
He could take over that heavyweight division.
There's no,
how do you imagine this?

2854
02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:57.990
Nobody.
Vladimir Klitschko did that going to be a huge fight and kill.

2855
02:42:57.991 --> 02:43:01.770
You go against flat.
Oh my God.

2856
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:04.770
You really think that Kimbo can hang with Letterman Klitschko than it would be.

2857
02:43:05.250 --> 02:43:07.500
Just numbers wise would be huge.
I bet you're right.

2858
02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:11.890
I bet for pay per view numbers by saying,
well,
we'll make a out of it.

2859
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:12.863
<v 1>I say,
know</v>

2860
02:43:12.970 --> 02:43:16.630
<v 6>what?
If Kimbo just really becomes good at it.
You know what?
If all the,
you know,</v>

2861
02:43:16.631 --> 02:43:20.230
working on take downs and all that shit.
Well that's just not his thing.

2862
02:43:20.231 --> 02:43:23.420
He's got a bad knee.
You saw the youtube videos,
the guy has a left hook.
Yeah.

2863
02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:26.320
When you've got a bad knee,
apparently it's got like one neat,

2864
02:43:26.321 --> 02:43:29.710
it's like bone on bone.
It's like,
remember they did a thing on it,

2865
02:43:29.711 --> 02:43:30.630
on the ultimate fighter there.

2866
02:43:30.631 --> 02:43:34.120
The doctor did an MRI on or some shit and I was like,
you know,

2867
02:43:34.121 --> 02:43:36.700
you've got a real deterioration of your cartilage in your ligament,

2868
02:43:36.910 --> 02:43:41.260
so all that leg kick in and all that,
you know,
sprawling and shit and Jujitsu.

2869
02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:43.390
Maybe that's not for him because his niece so fucked up.

2870
02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.370
But if he could just stand and throw those hands,

2871
02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:49.390
it's sort of an offender would fight Kimbo that would be a big imagine that of

2872
02:43:49.391 --> 02:43:53.040
Anders still fighting.
He's like,
how old is he?
That would be a huge paper.

2873
02:43:53.041 --> 02:43:55.870
Be Fine.
He's got to be like 48 or 49 right.
It's something like that.

2874
02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:58.270
Who would have ever thought,

2875
02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:02.470
I remember when he's fighting Riddick Bowe remember those fights back in the
day?

2876
02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:03.220
Yeah.

2877
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:07.360
Those were crazy wars with a small dude with a huge heart and a big guy that was

2878
02:44:07.361 --> 02:44:11.200
real talented but didn't train that hard and they just fuck it.
Went to a war.

2879
02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:14.650
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Was talented man.

2880
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:16.820
But he just never had the work ethic like Holyfield Dad,

2881
02:44:17.170 --> 02:44:19.030
he just never could completely get again.

2882
02:44:19.031 --> 02:44:23.620
Then Gelada came along and just fucked up his life.
A lot of fucked him up.

2883
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:26.560
Apparently they said that a lot of beatings with the really,

2884
02:44:26.561 --> 02:44:29.100
the beginning of the end for him,
he should never lost it.

2885
02:44:29.101 --> 02:44:30.880
Go out in the first place,
the first fight,

2886
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:33.760
a lot of beat the shit out of him and then dropped him with body shops,

2887
02:44:33.810 --> 02:44:35.170
the nuts over and over again.

2888
02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:37.750
Like it was purposely hitting him in the nuts to get out of the fight.

2889
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:41.260
It was a weirdest thing ever.
And that was it for Riddick Bowe like after that,

2890
02:44:41.261 --> 02:44:45.100
he was never really the same guy again.
Those are the days,
dude,

2891
02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:48.580
the days of the heavyweight division in boxing when it was like,

2892
02:44:48.581 --> 02:44:50.600
that's what we look forward to.
You know?

2893
02:44:51.010 --> 02:44:54.830
Remember Michael Dokes and remember all those dudes when Tyson came along,

2894
02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:56.260
just cleaned out that whole division.

2895
02:44:56.261 --> 02:44:59.380
Pink Glynn Thomas and Roy Nelson could take over boxing.

2896
02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:02.500
I bet he'd come a lot of dudes,
man.
Hell yeah.

2897
02:45:02.530 --> 02:45:05.280
Roy Nelson could beat a lot of dudes.
That guy has got an incredible channel.

2898
02:45:05.281 --> 02:45:07.360
Imagine how good his chin would be with boxing gloves.
Yup.

2899
02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:12.130
His Chin is good with MMA,
with knees.
He takes solid.
Nice.
The face,
dude,

2900
02:45:12.131 --> 02:45:14.080
Roy Nelson versus butter bean.

2901
02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:17.970
<v 1>That could be on the undercard of Kimberly.
A vendor.</v>

2902
02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:22.490
That's actually a great card.
That's a great card.

2903
02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:25.280
Holy Shit,
but it would never happen.
Roy.

2904
02:45:25.310 --> 02:45:28.520
Roy would never get out of his UFC contract just for that because not that many

2905
02:45:28.521 --> 02:45:31.460
fights.
There'd be huge though.
There's a lot of money in boxing.

2906
02:45:31.461 --> 02:45:32.420
We need a heavyweight division.

2907
02:45:32.421 --> 02:45:35.020
How many times we started this music is billing at least at times.

2908
02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:40.010
I'm trying to get you to put it together,
man.
Use your connections.

2909
02:45:40.011 --> 02:45:42.790
Talk to Bob,
Bob Arum.

2910
02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:47.180
If you're listening out there Kimbo versus a Vander or Kim and then the winner

2911
02:45:47.181 --> 02:45:52.040
of that gets Klitschko boom.
Boxing.
Boxing is back.
Roy Nelson.

2912
02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.050
Nelson again to who did we say?
Well,
I don't see any hands.
Butter,
butter bean.

2913
02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:00.830
Oh Dude,
forget about it.
Forget about it.
It's butter beans still fighting.

2914
02:46:03.250 --> 02:46:07.640
So big man.
He's,
he's way bigger than it used to be.
It used to be enormous.

2915
02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:10.160
He's huge now.
I,
he,
he had a cooking show

2916
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:12.310
<v 6>for a while.
He's working on a Carl's Jr.
Yeah,</v>

2917
02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:16.040
he could put away some fucking food.
That's a big boy.
Big Alabama boy.

2918
02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:19.790
He was working in American top team too.
He's trying to do some MMA for awhile.

2919
02:46:19.850 --> 02:46:23.180
Remember if our gangs pseudo leg locked him.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2920
02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:25.070
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
we've talked your ear off.

2921
02:46:25.130 --> 02:46:26.240
We appreciate the fuck Outta you.

2922
02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:29.570
I appreciate everybody that came down to Fort Lauderdale Improv.
It was,
it was,

2923
02:46:29.571 --> 02:46:32.300
it was humbling.
It was awesome.
The enthusiasm.

2924
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:35.170
It's been a just fucking incredible.
And uh,

2925
02:46:35.210 --> 02:46:38.210
I couldn't be more appreciative of all this shit.

2926
02:46:38.211 --> 02:46:41.300
I don't want anybody to think that this is anything that I've ever taken for

2927
02:46:41.301 --> 02:46:43.190
granted because we've been having a great fucking time.

2928
02:46:43.370 --> 02:46:44.480
Fort Lauderdale has been awesome.

2929
02:46:44.481 --> 02:46:49.010
And this week I'm going to film my next comedy special at the Tabernacle on four

2930
02:46:49.011 --> 02:46:53.690
20.
Uh,
yeah.
It's so corny.
I had to do it.
It's going to be in the Georgia,

2931
02:46:53.691 --> 02:46:56.930
Atlanta,
Georgia at the Tabernacle theater.
I believe it for a show.

2932
02:46:57.020 --> 02:46:58.970
I don't think there's any tickets left,
but the second show,

2933
02:46:58.971 --> 02:47:01.100
there's some tickets off.
There's an eight o'clock and 10 30.

2934
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:04.730
I'm going to use them both.
So don't think that if you come to the eight o'clock,

2935
02:47:04.731 --> 02:47:05.451
you're not going to get on.

2936
02:47:05.451 --> 02:47:09.350
I'm going to use a bolt and most likely it'll be a lot of different shit.

2937
02:47:09.351 --> 02:47:10.184
And I'm going to get to,

2938
02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.080
I'm going to do a question in the answer thing at the end,

2939
02:47:12.081 --> 02:47:14.930
just like I did on my first CD.
So we're going to have a good fucking time.

2940
02:47:14.931 --> 02:47:17.630
And then the next night it's Rashad Evans and John Jones.

2941
02:47:17.631 --> 02:47:22.100
You dirty bitches tomorrow.
Tommy Segura joins us on the podcast.

2942
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:26.990
Yay Tommy.

2945
02:47:35.241 --> 02:47:36.350
all this shit on Facebook.

2946
02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:40.700
Couldn't be happier that I'm connected to all you guys and couldn't be happier

2947
02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:45.800
that we're not all sort of together creating something that's more positive.

2948
02:47:45.801 --> 02:47:47.150
Death squad for life bitches.

2949
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:50.180

The kettle bells are coming.
The kettlebells are coming.

2955
02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:08.120
We've been talking about it.
I'll show them to you.
They're,
they're sick as fuck.

2956
02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:11.840
The first,
uh,
we're going to,
there's going to be two waves and kettlebells.
Uh,

2957
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:15.250
the first wave is going to be traditional kettlebells and then the second wave

2958
02:48:15.251 --> 02:48:18.640
is going to blow your fucking mind.
You're going to sell kettlebells,
son,

2959
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:22.010
you don't even know.
Wait,
wait till you see what,
what we're calling them.

2960
02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:25.540
I can't tell you shit son cause it's,
I'll tell you as soon as we get off there,

2961
02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:27.090
but it's,
it's nuts.
It's cool.

2962
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:29.290
It's crazy cause Joe kettles to do you do the weight.

2963
02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:31.640
You can just have to see it.
You just have to see it.
It's ridiculous.

2964
02:48:31.850 --> 02:48:33.650
I'll explain it to you.
You'll see it.
You'll know.

2965
02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:36.110
But thank you to [inaudible] dot com for everything they do.

2966
02:48:36.111 --> 02:48:40.330
It's the coolest company I've ever been involved with.
Bar none.
Go to o,
n n I.

2967
02:48:40.331 --> 02:48:44.490
T get in there and check out all the information about nootropics.

2968
02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:48.140
If you are interested in nootropics,
please Google the subject.

2969
02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:52.070
There's a lot of information both positive and negative about it,

2970
02:48:52.071 --> 02:48:55.790
but I can tell you personally that I have been using nootropics for a long time

2971
02:48:55.791 --> 02:48:59.150
and I notice a very tangible difference when I'm using them.

2972
02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:01.670
I use them before every comedy show.
I used them,

2973
02:49:01.671 --> 02:49:04.460
I like to use them before I work out.
There's a bunch of different stuff.

2974
02:49:04.461 --> 02:49:08.970
We have it on at.com the big one is Alpha brain is if I had one supplement that

2975
02:49:08.971 --> 02:49:12.660
I could take other than like vitamins and minerals one,
and you know,

2976
02:49:12.661 --> 02:49:15.750
if I could limit myself even as far as athletics supplements go,

2977
02:49:15.751 --> 02:49:19.230
I would take Alpha brain that is ma,
this is my all time favorite supplement.

2978
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:23.010
It hundred percent works for me.
It's totally subjective though.

2979
02:49:23.011 --> 02:49:25.850
Everybody's body is different.
I don't know what you know.

2980
02:49:25.860 --> 02:49:28.410
I don't know if you're a sensitive to good or bad.

2981
02:49:28.411 --> 02:49:32.510
I don't know if you're as into supplements as I am.
If you're not,
if you buy it,

2982
02:49:32.511 --> 02:49:34.800
if you don't feel it was worth it,
you get 100% of your money back.

2983
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:37.920
You don't have to return the product.
You just say,
this stuff sucks.
All right,

2984
02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:39.780
that's it folks.
We will see you tomorrow.

2985
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.840
We'd love the fuck out of you and praise Odin.

2986
02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:50.220
