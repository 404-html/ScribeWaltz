<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

7
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

8
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 2>We did as chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So chairs is now November,</v>

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 2>November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go by the November,</v>

10
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 2>November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

11
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's fucking stupid idea was to do this</v>

12
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:27.641
<v Speaker 2>God damn fitness challenge Tommy Buns </v>
<v Speaker 2>last year we did a nice calm 15.</v>

13
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Hot Yoga is so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Not even close to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

15
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 2>This was so much more difficult and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect this,</v>

16
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>but I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

17
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun to be competitive with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends.</v>

18
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun thing to fuck around,</v>

19
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like isolating something like this.</v>

20
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a year.</v>

21
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>You get to see different sides of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know existed.</v>

22
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

23
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>You worked out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>

24
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:57.104
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone gets the real perspective when </v>

25
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 2>joe is focused on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything like that in my</v>

26
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>fucking life.</v>

27
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.463
<v Speaker 2>Well I know the funniest because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's competitive and this brings </v>

28
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:09.704
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the funny thing was like Bert </v>

29
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever joe does,</v>

30
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll do double.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely he was like,</v>

31
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:21.971
<v Speaker 2>fuck that and that and the other thing I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect ever.</v>

32
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I thought Ari would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

33
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to walk in the East </v>
<v Speaker 2>village.</v>

34
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:27.644
<v Speaker 2>I was worried about him the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think you were going to do </v>

35
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.493
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worried about him the most from the </v>

36
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.300
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brain.</v>

37
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm out.</v>

38
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you were saying that though.</v>

39
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Three days in which you were texting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is dumb.</v>

40
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

42
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

43
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that this is what he's saying.</v>

45
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that and he means it when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says it,</v>

46
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>but he's also going to fucking kill you</v>

47
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>scotch and then it gets really serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not serious.</v>

48
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.723
<v Speaker 2>But I was looking for loopholes in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to trick you guys decide to like not </v>

49
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:52.844
<v Speaker 2>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought if I get like a bunch of </v>

50
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:54.734
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all to join in like seven or eight </v>

51
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 2>days in and then you can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

52
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 2>that I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

53
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.011
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

54
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.150

<v Speaker 2>I've been secretly working out,</v>

55
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but now we're too far away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't try to catch up.</v>

56
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

57
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:06.394
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like some psychological sneakers he </v>

58
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.163
<v Speaker 2>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying you should just do your </v>

59
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 2>regular workout and see what your score </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like.</v>

60
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.633
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a bit bigger than try to </v>

61
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.834
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big fan of that one to </v>

62
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 2>regular fucking way because you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining that for a second.</v>

63
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

64
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>this is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

65
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>But then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't lose.</v>

66
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.703
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I thought about it and the other </v>

67
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>thing I was thinking was this is what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

68
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>this is what my plan was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My plan was to keep up with you guys for</v>

69
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:34.524
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after two weeks to set aside a </v>

70
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>lot of time and about and elap us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.491
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

72
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go psycho.</v>

73
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go psycho.</v>

74
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.683
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put up pace that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think anybody else can keep up with for </v>

75
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>the last two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last two weeks I just said I'm going</v>

76
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>to put in some 600 point five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put in 1000 point day.</v>

77
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 2>That's that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I.</v>

78
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>that's when I stopped looking at you</v>

79
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>for context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at the.</v>

80
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 3>When we started this month and I put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my $700 a day,</v>

81
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 3>everyone was a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

82
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.271
<v Speaker 3>Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

83
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.360
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran almost a marathon that day.</v>

84
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.443
<v Speaker 3>Have no fucking clue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just looking at my goddamn phone </v>

85
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.784
<v Speaker 3>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just checking,</v>

86
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.910
<v Speaker 3>just checking the points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always keep.</v>

87
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Some people don't know what the points </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

88
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.133
<v Speaker 3>Well explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get 70 percent of your max heart </v>

89
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 3>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's three points a minute.</v>

90
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 3>If you get 80 percent of your max heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate or above,</v>

91
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 3>that's four points a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we all tried to stay in the 80 range.</v>

92
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get your money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

93
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>That's where we work out for an hour in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that range of 80 to 100 a heavy workout.</v>

94
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.990
<v Speaker 3>It gives you 240 points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maxed,</v>

95
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 3>maxed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just gives you context.</v>

96
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.300
<v Speaker 3>What a 600,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was not.</v>

97
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 3>I did a 930 cheese weight workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was over after that.</v>

98
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I was in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd call him.</v>

99
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

100
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 3>he's just fucking going dragging elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

101
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 3>He has it all the whole time is dragging</v>
<v Speaker 3>us around.</v>

102
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.150
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't even that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the.</v>

103
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 3>The the elk hunting day was mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>hiking mountains day.</v>

104
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 3>That was like a 600 point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

105
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.330
<v Speaker 3>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

106
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 3>when you were there and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually working out in the mountains as</v>

107
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 3>well though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

108
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

111
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.460

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

112
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 3>I got them Joseph on an elk cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation,</v>

<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

114
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.610

<v Speaker 3>It's work.</v>

115
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy guys.</v>

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.153
<v Speaker 3>Well you got a backpack on and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk as money as the most I've ever </v>

117
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 3>walked 12 miles in a day and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking up and down in elevation,</v>

118
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you're going up and down.</v>

119
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.063
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saved it one day because it was so </v>

120
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:39.451
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because I'd gone up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget like 130 flights of stairs.</v>

121
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Some something fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you ended up getting your.</v>

122
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 3>What'd you shoot on this island with </v>
<v Speaker 3>1000 pound elk?</v>

123
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta like relatively quickly,</v>

124
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

125
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 3>on the first day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

126
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 3>So then I came back in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back,</v>

127
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:56.284
<v Speaker 3>but the nod in 35 point day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my big was a thousand points </v>

128
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.783
<v Speaker 3>because I did 935 in the day and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did a podcast and then I did 100 later </v>

129
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 3>on in the day just to see you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

130
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was wondering if there was</v>

131
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

132
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 3>it was a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was time management.</v>

133
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I was suffered socially from the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

134
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Huge part was like who had the most time</v>
<v Speaker 3>to spend in the.</v>

135
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

136
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I was here two Mondays ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last Monday,</v>

137
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.594
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was popping out at the comedy store </v>

138
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 3>is going to hang out with everybody you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

139
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.740
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

140
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:32.630
<v Speaker 3>it's 10:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get a couple of hours.</v>

141
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Then all your walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your workouts were so late,</v>

142
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.423
<v Speaker 3>so I got to say that fuck you with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>post in your goddamn workouts in the </v>

143
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 3>middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so deflating.</v>

144
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.663
<v Speaker 3>You go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a two point lead and the wake </v>

145
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 3>up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I?</v>

146
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred points by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to break spirit.</v>

147
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.683
<v Speaker 3>It was fun because that's the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing already went through when he got </v>

148
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 3>this tracker and he found out all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work workarounds.</v>

149
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>So he would build up work in his tracker</v>

150
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 4>and then he'd Bluetooth it in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fucking night.</v>

151
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I'd also do the workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The workout is doing workouts at 1:30</v>

152
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.763
<v Speaker 4>AM and then I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me change and go out there two in </v>

153
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 4>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

154
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 4>you're going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were uploading in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of the night.</v>

156
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 4>No one can see the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The time that he was actually doing it.</v>

157
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the freaks route.</v>

158
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.113
<v Speaker 4>It was common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that because I already was so </v>

159
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 4>out of shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his heart rate was just skyrocketing,</v>

160
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.504
<v Speaker 4>like Ralphie walking upstairs and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>already and I went on a walk on a hike </v>

161
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.243
<v Speaker 4>and I was in the yellow the whole time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Ari was barely in green and I was </v>

162
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:34.881
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

163
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 4>he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in really good shape,</v>

164
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 4>and then you did that day with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He bought that theory really hard,</v>

165
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.694
<v Speaker 4>that hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hit that it was just that he was </v>

166
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 4>out of shape so that.</v>

167
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 4>And he was saying he was selling it so </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard and I called him.</v>

168
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 4>I had to go on the hike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's definitely shaped them immediately.</v>

169
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.053
<v Speaker 4>It's a psychological thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to think that a guy who </v>

170
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 4>hasn't been working out at all is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>good shape,</v>

171
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 4>but I think you pushed yourself through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first week or two.</v>

172
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Then you got in good shape and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>kept going.</v>

173
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

174
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 4>I had fought by plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

175
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 4>What was the plan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

176
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>Michelle Wolf offered to give.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just have her wear the thing from</v>

177
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.740
<v Speaker 4>day one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was definitely the fall,</v>

178
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 4>but I knew that was going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless,</v>

179
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 4>miles a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>

180
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 4>and when I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

181
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:27.194
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you wear this thing for me if I </v>

182
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 4>needed you to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

183
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're talking about.</v>

184
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely aware for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

185
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 4>I will stay in the right zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell no one.</v>

186
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 4>She feels left out because she thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>she would laugh.</v>

187
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is none of this is what we do.</v>

188
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.253
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't do long cardio sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did five and a half hours on an </v>

189
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 4>elliptical after running for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

190
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

191
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 4>get one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got 935 points.</v>

192
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.613
<v Speaker 4>I ran for an hour and then I stayed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the elliptical for five and a half </v>

193
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:01.754
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would see it go and you check in by </v>

194
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.313
<v Speaker 4>fucking broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Three hundred points and then you </v>

195
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 4>talk and he checked back in 30 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>later like,</v>

196
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still going.</v>

197
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Speaker 4>It's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

198
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 4>I just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

199
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to see how far I could go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thought was like,</v>

200
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 4>when you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how tired are you?</v>

201
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Can you take another step?</v>

202
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you take two?</v>

203
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you take three?</v>

204
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Can you just keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you can keep going.</v>

205
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Let's see how long I can keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you get to this point where you</v>

206
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:27.014
<v Speaker 4>just just think about breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think about what I was thinking </v>

207
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking about in and out,</v>

208
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 4>so just trying to stay almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditative state.</v>

209
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Trying to stay in the zone and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pouring sweat.</v>

210
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.310
<v Speaker 4>I set off the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alarm was so much.</v>

211
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 4>It's set off the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like four hours in.</v>

212
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's a story most people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get to tell about themselves.</v>

213
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was madness.</v>

214
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.743
<v Speaker 4>This is not how I work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I work out for like maybe an hour at </v>

215
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 4>most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit the bag,</v>

216
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I'll do some</v>

217
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lift a little weights.</v>

218
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to kill myself like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

219
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 3>This was very interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

220
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.053
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how my body would respond to like a </v>

221
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 3>month of psychotic exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do the things you guys do,</v>

222
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 3>the things where you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

223
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 3>the voice would say you got to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit,</v>

224
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 3>take a walk for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then go back and do it,</v>

225
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 3>and then if you just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

226
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm at four point eight miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just go until five or like,</v>

227
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.813
<v Speaker 3>or like I'm almost at halfway through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this hour so let me just get to 30 </v>

228
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>minutes and will be downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can stop there.</v>

229
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 3>It fucked with my obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 3>compulsiveness really bad.</v>

230
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I get to the place where I go,</v>

231
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:30.534
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get to 200 points and </v>

232
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.031
<v Speaker 3>then I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

233
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm only at 950 calories.</v>

234
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I want to get to a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

235
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

236
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm right by 2:20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get to 20.</v>

237
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.420
<v Speaker 3>And then it gets to a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

238
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's like it's you get in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone when you go,</v>

239
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>

240
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep walking and,</v>

241
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.270
<v Speaker 3>and dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got bad with me to the point where I,</v>

242
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean we'll talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should talk about physical breakdowns</v>

243
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:55.974
<v Speaker 3>and a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I know all of us dealt with some </v>

244
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:57.594
<v Speaker 3>sort of physical breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was having nightmares that you </v>

245
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 3>guys have fucked with my tracker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in that I was younger and lighter</v>

246
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:09.351
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't earning the night in a panic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and checked my fucking stats.</v>

247
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 3>But somebody got into your shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hacked it and I was like,</v>

248
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.640
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>

249
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put it past them that yeah,</v>

250
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you get that printer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I tell you my other treatment?</v>

251
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.833
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured out pretty quickly that the </v>

252
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.801
<v Speaker 3>way they do your Max heart rate is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>age minus a certain number of minus your</v>

253
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:29.844
<v Speaker 3>age and then you get it from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when you actually run it will move </v>

254
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 3>up or down from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But right away I was like,</v>

255
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

256
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 3>So I entered my age and before I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote to the my zone people and said,</v>

257
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.531
<v Speaker 3>my idiot wife wrote my age in wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually 74 was born in 44,</v>

258
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 3>not 74 and 44 the other way and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

259
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.790
<v Speaker 3>we'll change it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

260
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 3>So you put the other 70 year old man </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile.</v>

261
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

262
00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.403
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

263
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.713
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole month you are working on is </v>

264
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>

265
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.073
<v Speaker 3>That problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had already set it as the other thing </v>

266
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 3>and so it'll say you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to have a brand new thing.</v>

267
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:12.860
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

268
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:14.963
<v Speaker 3>It would've been great for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll just a walk around casually </v>

269
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>earning yellow the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I could have gotten.</v>

270
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 3>That would have been insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

271
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 3>that was definitely a good cheat my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

272
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went wrong.</v>

273
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

274
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that one would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>disqualified you for sure.</v>

275
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.573
<v Speaker 3>I can still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still on the fence with these </v>

276
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking five hour hikes he was taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen man,</v>

277
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 3>hiking is work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

278
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Work it fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going uphill for log.</v>

279
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you guys worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

280
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 3>of course you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>

281
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.733
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him here on the rowing machine </v>

282
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 3>going hard for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched it on my hikes.</v>

283
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.790
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

284
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You earned it.</v>

285
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to shit on that at all.</v>

286
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.770
<v Speaker 1>We should really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really keep ourselves from judging.</v>

287
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:04.910
<v Speaker 1>How hard are the people work?</v>

288
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Every time I did somebody got a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>score.</v>

289
00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:09.300
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's your.</v>

290
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Do you cheated?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd you cheat?</v>

291
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.520
<v Speaker 5>My hardest workout?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scored the shittiest my hardest workouts</v>

292
00:12:14.521 --> 00:12:16.200
<v Speaker 5>or running the hills and lifting </v>
<v Speaker 5>weights.</v>

293
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.323
<v Speaker 1>If I run the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me almost 40 points less than </v>

294
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.874
<v Speaker 1>if I just wrote a bike or wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical machine and you go up and </v>

295
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the pause.</v>

296
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.700
<v Speaker 1>The way I do it is I run hard and I take</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>

297
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.683
<v Speaker 1>I take like a deep breath when I get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of strokes dick the whole time </v>

298
00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:37.020
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's difficult.</v>

299
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.873
<v Speaker 1>Rub My balls to tell him what my left </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and I give myself another sprint </v>

300
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.163
<v Speaker 1>until I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like these points where I know I </v>

301
00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>can make it too if I go full clip and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I try to extend it a little bit and</v>

302
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.673
<v Speaker 1>I keep trying to extend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I do that I'm going into the </v>

303
00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:53.270
<v Speaker 1>red and on top of going in the red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

304
00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm with lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you need recovery time and recovery</v>

305
00:12:57.891 --> 00:12:58.070
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

306
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Your heart rate crash is way low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just do the elliptical machine</v>

307
00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:05.270
<v Speaker 1>and just couldn't like 15 resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got some,</v>

308
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.720
<v Speaker 1>some give to it and you start sweating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get into a zone.</v>

309
00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You just get into a niche way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it's a machine,</v>

310
00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:13.154
<v Speaker 1>makes it all easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just get into a zone and you </v>

311
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.180
<v Speaker 1>just got to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing with those,</v>

312
00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:18.014
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though like if you do the intense </v>

313
00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:22.280
<v Speaker 1>workout recovery is gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel it.</v>

315
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.940
<v Speaker 1>If you do those for like days in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is still a fatigue,</v>

316
00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's fatigue,</v>

317
00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:31.844
<v Speaker 1>but there was no like in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was getting me was the </v>

318
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:36.290
<v Speaker 1>pounding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the running up the hills.</v>

319
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no counting on the elliptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what stays in it.</v>

320
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.930
<v Speaker 1>My feet were starting to hurt by the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was running miles in the hills</v>

321
00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>every day with those minimalist shoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

322
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Which man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things they,</v>

323
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.493
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do work like they really do </v>

324
00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:53.024
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way they work is they make your </v>

325
00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:55.244
<v Speaker 1>feet work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your feet aren't conditioned for </v>

326
00:13:57.321 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 1>that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

327
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.890
<v Speaker 1>you feet are like one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that wear out,</v>

328
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>like a nice spongy running shoe is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just so much like smosh smosh.</v>

329
00:14:06.621 --> 00:14:07.454
<v Speaker 1>Every time you step on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get that and it's gone and you </v>

330
00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:12.230
<v Speaker 1>have this like really thin layer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber with some tread,</v>

331
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just your foot hitting the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>

332
00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:18.140
<v Speaker 1>There's very little padding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

333
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Were you using the ultras as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The running shoe.</v>

334
00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:22.394
<v Speaker 1>The ultra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was using one called zero and I was </v>

335
00:14:25.221 --> 00:14:30.221
<v Speaker 1>using a one called Vivo Vivo barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're my favorite ones there.</v>

336
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.110
<v Speaker 1>They're really good because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing the five toe ones,</v>

337
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 1>but Jim and my toes into shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm running hard.</v>

338
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired because I'm fucking exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

339
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I need something that covers all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toast.</v>

340
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't jam one into a rock because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>too exhausted.</v>

341
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Walk me through what your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a regular workout it was for you.</v>

342
00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:50.610
<v Speaker 5>I'd be curious of what everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular workout was.</v>

343
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 5>What I would do is I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if</v>

344
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I would run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would run for an hour,</v>

345
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.880
<v Speaker 1>just an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take my daughter hills there,</v>

346
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 1>running the hills because it gives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two things.</v>

347
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 1>One I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs exercise.</v>

348
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:03.900
<v Speaker 1>He's young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves,</v>

349
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>he loves to run with me and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real good form of exercise.</v>

350
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.643
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's more beneficial than the </v>

351
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made my ass bigger,</v>

352
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>made my legs bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they all got bigger.</v>

353
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Like especially like I could feel my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants fit different.</v>

354
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've only been doing this for </v>

356
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>like two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself up puts also,</v>

357
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.200
<v Speaker 1>nature has got to be healthy for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

358
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Before that I was doing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting stuff with for my legs.</v>

359
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I would do like squats or do cleans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presses and overheads,</v>

360
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do leg presses with kettlebells,</v>

361
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 1>overhead and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all great.</v>

362
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all really good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not sustained motion.</v>

363
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.863
<v Speaker 1>There's something about a sustained </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion of running hills that I think </v>

364
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>boosts your vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you more energy because you're,</v>

365
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to work,</v>

366
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>so to run a hill is one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things to do an exercise.</v>

367
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to fucking.</v>

368
00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.723
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically doing like bodyweight </v>

369
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 1>squats with one leg over and knocks when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going uphill.</v>

370
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I got a 45 man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

371
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.760
<v Speaker 1>so beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to hitting the bags,</v>

372
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.600
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is on days I would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

373
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:12.434
<v Speaker 1>I would run and then I would get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical machine or I'd run and I'd </v>

374
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:15.494
<v Speaker 1>get on the bike or the echo bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a beefed up airdyne </v>

375
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.573
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fuck you up or that assault </v>

376
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The assault fitness treadmill.</v>

377
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Like that one.</v>

378
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard.</v>

379
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a treadmill,</v>

380
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extra bump,</v>

381
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>harder than running on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running on the road,</v>

382
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.423
<v Speaker 1>much harder than making yourself to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it harder than that because for real </v>

383
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.960
<v Speaker 1>self powered and it's really beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>for brother treadmill.</v>

384
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 1>For that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mistake.</v>

385
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It was not bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the right move.</v>

386
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It's harder than running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that in my man cave was.</v>

387
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>That was my go to at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

388
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.180
<v Speaker 1>was good on that thing and dude that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not forgiving.</v>

389
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Wear you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called an assault fitness trainer.</v>

390
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the air runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Runner,</v>

391
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.923
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be shit at least 30 </v>

392
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 1>percent harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shit.</v>

393
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

394
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I get on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saw you got it,</v>

395
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like that?</v>

396
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

397
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>

398
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hurt your knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop pounding.</v>

399
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:20.564
<v Speaker 1>It's got a good amount of give to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's got this tread to it and </v>

400
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:23.564
<v Speaker 1>it's just got enough shock so that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running you don't feel like it's </v>

401
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>a big pounding on your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all self propelled,</v>

402
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>so you'll really get a good rhythm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your fucking legs get tired.</v>

403
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>What's Great Ford is sprinting on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get up and sprint.</v>

404
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.883
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can end your sprints that really </v>

405
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>raised your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the key also,</v>

406
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:42.020
<v Speaker 1>here's a big key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be distracted.</v>

407
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.273
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to either be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted by meditating and getting </v>

408
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:46.244
<v Speaker 1>into some sort of a weird breathing zone</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you got to listen to podcasts or you </v>

409
00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>got to listen to music or you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>

410
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.540
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was books on tape did the best really</v>

411
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 1>for when I was out in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was out in the wild,</v>

412
00:17:58.351 --> 00:17:59.184
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to books on tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like something thinking about </v>

413
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 1>something distracted me from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical exertion of exercises,</v>

414
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but indoors it was a two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helped violent movies and fights.</v>

415
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.173
<v Speaker 1>Watching fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get your get your heart rate </v>

416
00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:15.234
<v Speaker 1>jacked up when you get your heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked up and you're watching guys get </v>

417
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:20.200
<v Speaker 1>hit and you fucked it honestly</v>

419
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.870
<v Speaker 2>treadmill and then during timeouts you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could like do whatever.</v>

420
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I would do the thing where like you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of going,</v>

421
00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:30.560
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed that there was like a punt</v>

422
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:31.990
<v Speaker 2>return or it kicked off</v>

423
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.233
<v Speaker 1>when I watch gladiator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a giant spike whenever there </v>

424
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>was sword fights and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

426
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.060

<v Speaker 1>in this movie that I'm like fighting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not flirting with you,</v>

463
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to not have a stroke.</v>

464
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I went to a dark place to a dark place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you took us with you.</v>

465
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

466
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

467
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was like,</v>

468
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you think you can do.</v>

469
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens.</v>

470
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird switch that goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

471
00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:46.580
<v Speaker 1>let's see who's willing to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

472
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.823
<v Speaker 1>all my last week or so was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a fight for my people were </v>

473
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 1>asking me about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just dehydration.</v>

474
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:58.980
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dude.</v>

475
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>People would message us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

476
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.343
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

477
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Joe's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>

478
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get wrapped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

479
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:04.774
<v Speaker 1>some people were upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they wanted me almost to get it </v>

480
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 1>because I've always rag on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfit guys to get it.</v>

481
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.773
<v Speaker 1>I have not ranked on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would have said is that I have heard </v>

482
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>some negative opinions about crossfits </v>
<v Speaker 1>from experts that are trust.</v>

483
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:18.723
<v Speaker 1>Like Steve Maxwell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fitness expert by any stretch </v>

484
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:21.664
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination.</v>

485
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether they're crossfits </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad or good.</v>

486
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's probably based on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>

487
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the way you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if somebody asks me,</v>

488
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 1>is Jujitsu good for your body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

489
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of surgeries.</v>

490
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody I know's had surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody I know that does Jujitsu,</v>

491
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.673
<v Speaker 1>he gets up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even get his blue belt and he </v>

492
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 1>had surgery right before we started this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

493
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Joe Did say those crossfit people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree hugging hippies.</v>

494
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black belt.</v>

495
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I want a yoga black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

496
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Yoga black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a blue belt and yoga dude.</v>

497
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:53.944
<v Speaker 1>Halfway through the month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told Tom the other day and he laughs </v>

498
00:21:56.121 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 1>and so I tried it on stage and a worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I stopped producing semen,</v>

499
00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>just coughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dust,</v>

500
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dick had the dry heaves.</v>

501
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.224
<v Speaker 1>Just people ask me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's your sex drive to go </v>

502
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:07.680
<v Speaker 1>up with Mike.</v>

503
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

504
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

505
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no energy for that.</v>

506
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll be so tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tired.</v>

507
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 1>How about those sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was sleeping like a fucking perfect</v>

508
00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a baby most of the time.</v>

509
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.343
<v Speaker 1>You know what I noticed is a big one for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that really might make me change the </v>

510
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:28.381
<v Speaker 1>way I live is zero anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero negative chatter.</v>

511
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.553
<v Speaker 1>That's what I found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a realistic view of the world </v>

512
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that you get from rigorous exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my theory and it's.</v>

513
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's.</v>

514
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.473
<v Speaker 1>We have too much of a history as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species of constantly avoiding danger </v>

515
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.273
<v Speaker 1>and I think we live in a place that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>far too safe for our natural instincts </v>

516
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.293
<v Speaker 1>and so we're constantly looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be bad or looking for things </v>

517
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>to be dangerous or confronting.</v>

518
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.113
<v Speaker 1>Confronting our own mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it on the back burner and </v>

519
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 1>letting all that weirdness manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in all sorts of other fears.</v>

520
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.703
<v Speaker 1>Fears about the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fears about economics and fears about </v>

521
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.064
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're dealing with as human </v>

522
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>beings all the time and I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only a certain amount you can do.</v>

523
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you have rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

524
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:18.844
<v Speaker 1>it puts in perspective what that certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount actually is and what you can </v>

525
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.104
<v Speaker 1>control as a person that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just chill your body out and </v>

526
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>look at this whole thing for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

527
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be fine or we're not,</v>

528
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and then it won't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

529
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:34.684
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing that we do when we do </v>

530
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:36.904
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do this because our body has a need </v>

531
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 1>for exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a built in neat.</v>

532
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.303
<v Speaker 1>It's got an engine that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed and if you don't push it starts </v>

533
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

534
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 4>starts fucking with you and asking you </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird questions like,</v>

535
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that guy think he is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

536
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 4>he wants to start problems that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get upset if things don't make any sense</v>

537
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:54.884
<v Speaker 4>to be upset at it wants conflict is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of you that wants conflict because </v>

538
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:58.994
<v Speaker 4>it thinks that conflicts are part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>programming because it's been our way </v>

539
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:02.534
<v Speaker 4>for millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whatever the fuck we were then to </v>

540
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been conflict along the way.</v>

541
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.083
<v Speaker 4>People have been trying to eat us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things have been trying to kill us and </v>

542
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:10.814
<v Speaker 4>this is the only time ever that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that and I think the </v>

543
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 4>only time you could see things with </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective is when you blow out all the</v>

544
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 4>biological shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's jerk off,</v>

545
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 4>like how many times have you jerked off </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then had a totally different opinion</v>

546
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.343
<v Speaker 4>of a person above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I gave George often not called </v>

547
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I call this person?</v>

548
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just jerked off now I see.</v>

549
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.083
<v Speaker 4>I see what this whole is some weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological trick playing some stupid </v>

550
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know you were capable of it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you?</v>

577
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.540
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

578
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.810
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was capable of running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And stuff,</v>

579
00:25:57.811 --> 00:25:59.160
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could sort of do that,</v>

580
00:25:59.161 --> 00:26:00.930
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know quite how much.</v>

581
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Eighty percent on a rower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's angry person.</v>

582
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when he's playful and that's my zen</v>

583
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 4>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even when he's playful,</v>

584
00:26:12.061 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 4>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still energy.</v>

585
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Like that anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the anger that he gave everybody on</v>

586
00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:21.870
<v Speaker 4>that fucking podcast you did with one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my favorite podcast ever.</v>

587
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 4>Always hiking around doing a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking shit about us.</v>

588
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Not Seventy percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant.</v>

589
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

590
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.183
<v Speaker 4>it's energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that kind of anger that you have </v>

591
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.960
<v Speaker 4>that's either in you or it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew already had it.</v>

592
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of getting the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>engine fired up again.</v>

593
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.193
<v Speaker 4>He's not too old now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to play basketball law needs to </v>

594
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.523
<v Speaker 4>do when you buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my resolutions this year was to </v>

595
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:46.284
<v Speaker 4>go to the gym like once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something attainable and I still </v>

596
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 4>hadn't done it until.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when you did you Jitsu,</v>

597
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 4>you were very enthusiastic about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember you were fucking trying hard,</v>

598
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I remember one time you legitimately</v>

599
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:02.840
<v Speaker 4>swept me legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes he did.</v>

600
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.080
<v Speaker 4>It was a brown belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a brown belt.</v>

601
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.523
<v Speaker 4>People once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it just once in a while you'd be </v>

602
00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:09.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

603
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I forgot to tell you 100 percent the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>

604
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 4>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

605
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 4>we were rolling together and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay dude,</v>

606
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.430
<v Speaker 4>let's just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to hurt you.</v>

607
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we got into position.</v>

608
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 4>I got on top of him and I just got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little relaxed and all of a sudden,</v>

609
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ari hip pops takes my leg out from under</v>

610
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:34.281
<v Speaker 4>me and he swept me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mother fucker got a little poem,</v>

611
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:35.330
<v Speaker 4>and he exploded.</v>

612
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.911
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

613
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what's up.</v>

614
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 4>So I knew a part of already that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys did know because already now,</v>

615
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:41.683
<v Speaker 4>by the way that he swept me right back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so part of me that really wants to </v>

616
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:46.734
<v Speaker 4>experience like trying to roll with Joe </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a second after this contest and </v>

617
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:54.591
<v Speaker 4>knowing what he's capable of just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel true helplessness feeling it is.</v>

618
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 4>This is why it's a good feeling because </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>

619
00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:58.614
<v Speaker 4>If you can handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then at least you know where you are on </v>

620
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:02.154
<v Speaker 4>this little weird food chain of who can </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill with their bare hands and then you </v>

621
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 4>also know that whatever these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>know you can learn to do.</v>

622
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.033
<v Speaker 4>It's not a physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know guys that are much weaker </v>

623
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 4>than me that can fuck me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we rolled together,</v>

624
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 4>they're going to tap me 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

625
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 4>My friend Danny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Danny,</v>

626
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:21.150
<v Speaker 4>weighs a hundred and 60 something </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

627
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.610
<v Speaker 4>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I tapped him when he was young.</v>

628
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 4>He kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He strangles me.</v>

629
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 4>He strangles me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just what?</v>

630
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Superior techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way better than me.</v>

631
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Way better way more focused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Been doing it.</v>

632
00:28:34.361 --> 00:28:37.670
<v Speaker 4>You realize that sounds like to a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who just with you,</v>

633
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.040
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to listen.</v>

634
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 4>You have to have the time to get serious</v>
<v Speaker 4>about something.</v>

635
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 4>We have the time to get serious about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this for a lot of time to get serious,</v>

636
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 4>but suddenly out of the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

637
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Tom suggested it like four or five days </v>
<v Speaker 4>before it started.</v>

638
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was not a planned out thing at all.</v>

639
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Been wearing that thing for perspective </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

640
00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.163
<v Speaker 4>I started January with it and like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>average one has been probably 2100 </v>

641
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 4>points or something.</v>

642
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.820
<v Speaker 4>How much you get this one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 five.</v>

643
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.733
<v Speaker 4>So talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about the percentages of how we </v>

644
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 4>finished in the [inaudible] that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody hitting them up.</v>

645
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:13.674
<v Speaker 4>That blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they said there's a million </v>

646
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 4>registered users first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And zero point one percent.</v>

647
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But hold on.</v>

648
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Most of those warranty didn't even have </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on.</v>

649
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're going into November is now.</v>

650
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.263
<v Speaker 4>We're not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying everybody was actively </v>

651
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:31.960
<v Speaker 4>all using a million users.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

652
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Well whoever is using it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't know what the database.</v>

653
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 4>How it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good point.</v>

654
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:37.554
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fair point because like we </v>

655
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.414
<v Speaker 4>really don't know what percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people actually keeping people </v>

656
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:42.304
<v Speaker 4>trying.</v>

657
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 2>We know the killer was a d one athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

658
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking.</v>

659
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:46.804
<v Speaker 2>Jim has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that we can actually </v>

660
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 2>pointed against people who were trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to guess.</v>

661
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.514
<v Speaker 2>If we agree on a number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you guys say that like half the </v>

662
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:58.351
<v Speaker 2>people would use it regularly or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a million people with behalf.</v>

663
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.933
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still talking about point five </v>

664
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 2>will be point four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point five percent percentile,</v>

665
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 nine point fifth percentile.</v>

666
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go up much.</v>

667
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't go up much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even under a smaller variable,</v>

668
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:12.394
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what those other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are at the top are probably fitness </v>

669
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 2>instructors and that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what my space is my space.</v>

670
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 2>That was nice though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

671
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>that's what my zones told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

672
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:23.764
<v Speaker 2>that was my other cheap plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to the gym with $15 and say please </v>

673
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:31.051
<v Speaker 2>wear this and seen the sweet spot.</v>

674
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't too much,</v>

675
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>but I would have to do it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

676
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.131
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

677
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:36.964
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll walk you through my plan the </v>

678
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.420
<v Speaker 2>whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your plan?</v>

679
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Do not get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was number one.</v>

680
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.443
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get hurt because if I get hurt or </v>

681
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:45.334
<v Speaker 2>get heel spurs on windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so excited at the prospect of you </v>

682
00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 2>being out anytime someone has you hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ankle or something,</v>

683
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:57.511
<v Speaker 2>but when I hurt my ankle but cautious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I knew this is not real.</v>

684
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 2>You saw me slip side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I saw her.</v>

685
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll call my fucking wife right now.</v>

686
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 2>My friend molly saw you in fucking spin </v>
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>

687
00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Expand the one exercise you don't use </v>
<v Speaker 2>your legs for.</v>

688
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Were you worried about them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was sick.</v>

689
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew.</v>

690
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I knew you were giving me the fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

691
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't make this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyatt guys,</v>

692
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:38.190
<v Speaker 2>he told me he was sick and he took </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos of his medication and he went one</v>

693
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 2>day and then you were right back to full</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

694
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

695
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

696
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 2>What has it been crazy that a day where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

697
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.053
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get something and then buy </v>

698
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:50.883
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking $150 or so and that was </v>

699
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of or the second worst day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I put it on.</v>

700
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get that.</v>

701
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>And I walked down the street and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

702
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I felt so sick.</v>

703
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I got 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

704
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Like a nun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

705
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:05.471
<v Speaker 2>That right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

706
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day I was able to get like,</v>

707
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I think a hundred and something and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was split up into also.</v>

708
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And so then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty fucked right now by the way.</v>

709
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Right at that point I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

710
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>burt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not coming last.</v>

711
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a casual attended.</v>

712
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Two of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

713
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.490

<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

714
00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:26.400
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took a deep breath.</v>

715
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you something.</v>

716
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 2>This is something that we should all </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out for health.</v>

717
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

718
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:35.014
<v Speaker 2>I've been eating a lot of Kimchi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fermented cabbage and a lot </v>

719
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Kombucha.</v>

720
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

721
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Real brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brutal farts.</v>

722
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.813
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that healthy like probiotic stuff </v>

<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

724
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.923
<v Speaker 4>I mean really big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gotten sick in a long time to </v>

725
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 4>always take these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I started drinking them too.</v>

726
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 4>They're always good to do the shit gts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gts or the shit.</v>

727
00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 4>They're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They taste good.</v>

728
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 4>They're healthy for you at a whole foods</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy telling me like,</v>

729
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:02.931
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>

730
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:04.500
<v Speaker 4>I saw your drink this in the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's five.</v>

731
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.620
<v Speaker 4>It's got alcohol so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't drink that in the,</v>

732
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:07.940
<v Speaker 4>in the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

733
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.863
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it every single time so </v>

734
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 4>you can just try to catch me if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

735
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:12.893
<v Speaker 4>But for the warning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did your job well as less than half </v>

736
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.930
<v Speaker 4>a percent of right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that what it is?</v>

737
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 4>What is the number that they have to.</v>

738
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 4>It's more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

739
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 4>My daughter's drink Kombucha in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

740
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's less than half a percent,</v>

741
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 4>so they're not getting buzzed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some preposterous amount of alcohol.</v>

742
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see how many drink to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get drunk.</v>

743
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.813
<v Speaker 4>The whole history of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to sell them in the store and </v>

744
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:36.990
<v Speaker 4>then apparently what was going on was </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

745
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.843
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a strong brew and they would sit </v>

746
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:43.700
<v Speaker 4>there fermenting and then when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would test them after they had fermented</v>

747
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:44.534
<v Speaker 4>for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the alcohol content would get over one </v>

748
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:46.754
<v Speaker 4>half of one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like somewhere around where </v>

749
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 4>they need to draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get a non alcoholic beer,</v>

750
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.940
<v Speaker 4>it's got a touch of the blues in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

751
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Already touched with buck off.</v>

752
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking idiot.</v>

753
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.330
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make you still super sober.</v>

754
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you look fucking perk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

755
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.890
<v Speaker 4>we're running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting high as fuck.</v>

756
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.080
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>

757
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.510
<v Speaker 4>There's an endorphin aspect to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I this.</v>

758
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I was saying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody is that when this was over,</v>

759
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:19.964
<v Speaker 4>when the whole thing was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody made a pill that made me </v>

760
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:26.420
<v Speaker 4>feel how I feel when I have those hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>workout days,</v>

761
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.760
<v Speaker 4>I take that pill every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was going to tell you.</v>

762
00:34:29.761 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck pill that I felt so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>relief,</v>

763
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:38.021
<v Speaker 4>but I felt like it was totally tied to </v>
<v Speaker 4>days where I really worked hard,</v>

764
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.043
<v Speaker 4>like one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was like a medium workout without </v>

765
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.063
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I went back and forth about </v>

766
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:44.271
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

767
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:45.104
<v Speaker 4>I still felt good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on the days where it was like three </v>

768
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 4>plus hours of working out and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally spent.</v>

769
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.603
<v Speaker 4>Then I felt the most calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know a part of that physically </v>

770
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 4>just got tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd had zero strength.</v>

771
00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.693
<v Speaker 4>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys think any of that's tied to </v>

772
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.164
<v Speaker 4>like while you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to be off your all your </v>

773
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 4>technology for awhile?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're big on that.</v>

774
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

775
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.700
<v Speaker 4>I thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

776
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.660
<v Speaker 4>it's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely a factor.</v>

777
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you started talking about it,</v>

778
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.293
<v Speaker 4>I tried to start doing things like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning waiting or waiting to look </v>

779
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:15.280
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

780
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I like open the phone so like just do </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even work out.</v>

781
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean just do life things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up,</v>

782
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.700
<v Speaker 4>have coffee and just not look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had to think about it.</v>

783
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

784
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.440
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

785
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.481
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

786
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I felt sort of clear too,</v>

787
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:32.444
<v Speaker 4>but same way I do with skiing where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you gotta take your mind off </v>

788
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 4>everything in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

789
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Ari Be skiing is a perfect example.</v>

790
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 5>When you're skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't look at your phone,</v>

791
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.273
<v Speaker 5>you're going down a fucking mountain in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just enjoying that and that's </v>

792
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:48.891
<v Speaker 5>part of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got a great app and they'll have</v>

793
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.520
<v Speaker 5>a great app.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

794
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:51.001
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

795
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at my phone while I'm skiing,</v>

796
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 5>but there was an app that tells you how </v>
<v Speaker 5>fast you get going,</v>

797
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.453
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got an up to 40 miles per hour on a </v>

798
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 5>fucking snowboard and you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to the bottom.</v>

799
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:00.811
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real quick,</v>

800
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 5>what's my speed like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

801
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've definitely.</v>

802
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm always worried about people wiping </v>
<v Speaker 5>out in front of me,</v>

803
00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.990
<v Speaker 5>wiping out onto me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you.</v>

804
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 5>But you film your kids skiing a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>

805
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:10.944
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I got taken out by one dude on a </v>

806
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.314
<v Speaker 5>mountain once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just cut in front of me like way too </v>

807
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:16.600
<v Speaker 5>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

808
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.730
<v Speaker 5>you gotta control your skin half the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

809
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.613
<v Speaker 5>like I should go away for your own good </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch out and you realize like you're </v>

810
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 5>testing your health out with all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people and most of the time people</v>

811
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 5>were doing their best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time comes flying out of the</v>

812
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:33.240
<v Speaker 5>trees over your drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you get on that fucking ski lifts,</v>

813
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.253
<v Speaker 5>they don't test you for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do smoke weed when you're skiing now </v>

814
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

815
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.411
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

816
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

817
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 5>Every time I asked we'd go with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

818
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 5>but I ski with my kids.</v>

819
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 5>Adults now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could explain.</v>

820
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I have to keep an eye on those little </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuckers.</v>

821
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Get care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get what you're saying.</v>

822
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.470
<v Speaker 5>When you see with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do that with my kids.</v>

823
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:10.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't smoke weed at the end of the day</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's me and Leanne,</v>

824
00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 5>we go to park city every year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the best and at the end of the day,</v>

825
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:15.923
<v Speaker 5>me and Leanne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take a rip and then we'll go down </v>

826
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:18.264
<v Speaker 5>one the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one I fucking throw in headset's </v>

827
00:37:19.061 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 5>a little Jane's addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming down the mountain.</v>

828
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.620
<v Speaker 5>All my toes flying into a fucking corner</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 40 miles an hour.</v>

829
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 5>Just going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just thinking in my head.</v>

830
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 5>This could all really go bad right now.</v>

831
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.210
<v Speaker 5>Don't fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't fall down.</v>

832
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 5>Don't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't fall down.</v>

833
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't get her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't get hurt.</v>

834
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.873
<v Speaker 5>Don't fuck with us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just barely have any control of our </v>

835
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:50.860
<v Speaker 5>bodies as we slide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barely,</v>

836
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.140
<v Speaker 5>barely in control pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No control over joke and roll shoulders.</v>

837
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what I want us to do right</v>

838
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:09.324
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what I want us to do as a </v>

839
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:12.550
<v Speaker 5>group right now and chose the only one </v>
<v Speaker 5>that didn't get this happen.</v>

840
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 5>What I want us to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kelly slater's wave pool.</v>

841
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.530
<v Speaker 5>That looks dope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

842
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.633
<v Speaker 5>A foursome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the safest place to learn how to </v>

843
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 5>surf and it's just like a two hour </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive.</v>

844
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Does anyone know how to surf?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took two lessons,</v>

845
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Indonesia and master it and retired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can come out of retirement,</v>

846
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.004
<v Speaker 5>so that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've had slightly more experience </v>

847
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 5>was almost none.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be a good next year.</v>

848
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 5>What learned a certain time</v>

849
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 3>on a board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a board over the whole month.</v>

850
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.823
<v Speaker 3>We'll get Kelly slater to design some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of board that we have to wear some </v>

851
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:51.781
<v Speaker 3>sort of heart rate monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time on a board you could stand</v>

852
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:57.330
<v Speaker 3>up over the course of a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial wave machines.</v>

853
00:38:57.331 --> 00:39:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you.</v>

854
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.583
<v Speaker 3>Give Kelly slater time right now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop the board that has feet pads </v>

855
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:09.091
<v Speaker 3>that measures your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet when you're standing up.</v>

856
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 3>So at the time on a board standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since none of us know how to surf.</v>

857
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.623
<v Speaker 3>Fuck time on a board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up one of those artificial </v>

858
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 3>weight machines next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda hate this.</v>

859
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this already.</v>

860
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:21.263
<v Speaker 3>So you just have to enlist and a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give up your life list in a </v>

861
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:24.634
<v Speaker 3>place like why he was Shane Dorian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where those fucking sue shame was just </v>

862
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:29.890

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 3>He was on the podcast right before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

864
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.120

865
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane Dorian almost died at Mavericks.</v>

866
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.240
<v Speaker 3>He got held under for two waves and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess under there,</v>

867
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 3>he decided to create these suits where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have ceo to carf juices.</v>

868
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 3>It Literally Changed Big Wave Surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's saves so many lives.</v>

869
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
<v Speaker 3>He was just fucking shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear I met him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's the coolest shit ever.</v>

878
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 3>What got you into hanging out with Kelly</v>
<v Speaker 3>slater?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like brothers.</v>

880
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 3>My favorite thing he said in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast was when he goes,</v>

881
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:21.184
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

883
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't push myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an,</v>

884
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.180
<v Speaker 3>that's an already thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

885
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we did was not healthy.</v>

886
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I wanted to talk about.</v>

887
00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Not Sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

888
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

889
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sustainable.</v>

890
00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:38.850
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

891
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.683
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep up spin class and try </v>

892
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 3>to do on evenings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to do the six mile jog.</v>

893
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.953
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thought.</v>

894
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Keep up the 31st.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I talked to you.</v>

895
00:40:47.941 --> 00:40:52.941
<v Speaker 4>I talked to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that last workout I was dead.</v>

896
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.173
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't have gotten that much </v>

897
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.510
<v Speaker 4>further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In all honesty.</v>

898
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.583
<v Speaker 4>After my pis came out a weird color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really did have phantom pain to my </v>

899
00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:05.090
<v Speaker 4>kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really was like,</v>

900
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:09.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe that wasn't just dehydration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there something more.</v>

901
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.193
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really did have some weird phantom </v>

902
00:41:12.301 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 4>idea that there was a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but physically I felt pretty good man,</v>

903
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.100
<v Speaker 4>because the whole thing was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Rhabdo.</v>

904
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.440
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called Rhabdo.</v>

905
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.260
<v Speaker 4>My locis is that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did I say it right?</v>

906
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Rhabdo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

907
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Speaker 4>has actually been the source of death </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a few fighters where,</v>

908
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys</v>

909
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 1>got really beat up and it crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really difficult fight.</v>

910
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.293
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that did the men was they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were probably overtrained and they </v>

911
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:43.364
<v Speaker 1>probably did too much and the gym didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give themselves enough time to recover </v>

912
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and then had a really brutal fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

913
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're young in particular,</v>

914
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

915
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.073
<v Speaker 1>you're a little too wild and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that there's like this point </v>

916
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 1>of diminishing returns when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

917
00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well see we pushed into some weird </v>

918
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

919
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.150
<v Speaker 2>but we did get through that a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the three will,</v>

920
00:42:04.151 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 2>should have liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thought I was too much.</v>

921
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 2>We got to give up and we kept going and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it became okay again.</v>

922
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's why</v>

923
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it works for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't work for a fighter.</v>

924
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.050
<v Speaker 1>No one's kicking our ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about when you're a fighter</v>

925
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 1>is if someone's kicking your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might push even past where we pushed</v>

926
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.490
<v Speaker 1>in terms of output in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

927
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 1>in any particular hour or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

928
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half hour,</v>

929
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>40 minute session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go too far.</v>

930
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we would just keep going at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.520
<v Speaker 1>at 80 percent sometimes you get forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>into 90 percent sure.</v>

932
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.373
<v Speaker 1>Long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if someone's better than you </v>

933
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:36.950
<v Speaker 1>or especially if you're tired from </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

934
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these guys are going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>

935
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.873
<v Speaker 1>especially in like younger guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have maybe the most scientific </v>

936
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:44.864
<v Speaker 1>coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going into the fight stout like </v>

937
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 1>November first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going through it like that.</v>

938
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

939
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.593
<v Speaker 1>They're going into it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only they going into a fight like </v>

940
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going through a whole,</v>

941
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

942
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 1>eight week camp like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they might be broken down like real</v>

943
00:42:58.491 --> 00:42:59.324
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just push themselves through the </v>

944
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>whole thing and then they have like at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of it,</v>

945
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 1>their body's failing and they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>given themselves enough time to recover.</v>

946
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this Rhabdo shit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

947
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:13.650
<v Speaker 1>your muscles and it has something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with proteins that your muscles pull up.</v>

948
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:14.834
<v Speaker 1>The actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm given a really stupid </v>

949
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:21.320
<v Speaker 1>definition of what rhabdomyolysis is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I pretty close?</v>

950
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.693
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

951
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Breakdown of muscle tissue releasing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage protein into the blood.</v>

952
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very dangerous.</v>

953
00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Israeli causes kidney shutdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

954
00:43:31.571 --> 00:43:32.404
<v Speaker 2>That like November second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my muscles all felt sore for the first </v>

955
00:43:36.191 --> 00:43:38.680
<v Speaker 2>time all month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine felt so right away.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then not again for not again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was,</v>

957
00:43:40.991 --> 00:43:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I would guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back into them.</v>

958
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.293
<v Speaker 2>The thing in spin classes like when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the saddle and sprint is I </v>

959
00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:50.320
<v Speaker 2>just got to a place where my legs were </v>
<v Speaker 2>always fucking wasted and I was like,</v>

960
00:43:50.321 --> 00:43:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try this again.</v>

961
00:43:52.031 --> 00:43:52.251
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

962
00:43:52.251 --> 00:43:55.210
<v Speaker 2>my legs just aren't wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were always wasted.</v>

963
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.073
<v Speaker 2>I could now at the end of this like run </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the gym and back I got stopped like </v>

964
00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:01.630
<v Speaker 2>three times in the way in her run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like two minutes.</v>

965
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

966
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.190
<v Speaker 2>like real running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

967
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.033
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it was like,</v>

968
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:04.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it.</v>

969
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Did I felt like such an improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

970
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Huge them through the month that I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

971
00:44:09.431 --> 00:44:14.431
<v Speaker 2>I ran 12 miles on the fifth and last day</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you were on antibiotics,</v>

972
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.760
<v Speaker 2>psychotics and you were just going fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta say Ari,</v>

973

<v Speaker 1>I always knew that you had a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't appreciate it as much as I </v>

977
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.063
<v Speaker 1>appreciated this month for you to do it </v>

978
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:36.924
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't do shit other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the occasional hike or fuck around and </v>

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:03.110
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my hand started filming.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for a second and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1036
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.500
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go out like a light at the end of</v>

1037
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.333
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.320
<v Speaker 2>The Hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you sleeping tonight</v>

1039
00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.500
<v Speaker 1>like a dead man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven hours dead man dead.</v>

1040
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>How long after we started did you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the marijuana</v>

1042
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got,</v>

1043
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.080
<v Speaker 1>did you guys get them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1044
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was coming so I tapered off,</v>

1045
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 1>tapered off all through September and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also I was on a lot of harmony trips.</v>

1046
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 1>The elk hunting trip in Utah was seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1047
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't smoke on those no together </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams on those a little bit.</v>

1048
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:50.363
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you decided early on with all that </v>

1049
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to experience it as a,</v>

1050
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 1>as Electra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

1051
00:47:58.661 --> 00:48:03.661
<v Speaker 1>human and I didn't want to ever be drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really want to be high.</v>

1052
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take Beta blockers so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get nervous.</v>

1053
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I try to experience it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just experienced what it is.</v>

1054
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.413
<v Speaker 1>I saw Adam Green tree like kill some elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wherever the fuck he is these days </v>

1055
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and a bear claimed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

1056
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 1>He shot a moose?</v>

1057
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.573
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just went on and on it and I dug it </v>

1058
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:25.954
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Con and a grizzly bear claimed it and </v>

1059
00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 1>covered it with dirt right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire Moose?</v>

1060
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1061
00:48:32.241 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 1>he shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took part of it.</v>

1062
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>See what a moose is probably like 1800 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

1063
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 1>They're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a big elk.</v>

1064
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:44.000
<v Speaker 1>It like a rocky mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elk is like 800 pounds.</v>

1065
00:48:44.001 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Moose is a thousand pounds bigger than</v>

1066
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 1>that when it's fully mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something that's what Adam shot.</v>

1067
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He shot a gigantic moose so they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>only carry so much of it out like this.</v>

1068
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds of meat.</v>

1069
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen hundred pounds moves might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or 800 pounds of it is meat.</v>

1070
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to take it out in loads.</v>

1071
00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So if you have two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1072
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several loads.</v>

1073
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:08.884
<v Speaker 1>So they took out one pack out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they came back and the giant grizzly </v>

1074
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:13.804
<v Speaker 1>bear had claimed it and covered it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grizzly bear was still in the </v>

1075
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:17.930
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1076
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:18.800
<v Speaker 1>He covered it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And Australia is an interesting place </v>

1085
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 1>because one of the reasons why it mean </v>

<v Speaker 1>every part of a man you want to be.</v>

1092
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 1>How he met his floor in his hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabin is fucking amazing.</v>

1093
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And he did it himself by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just establish per capita.</v>

1094
00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Australians are more manly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1095
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 1>The Korean Americans for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1096
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had to like to see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers at,</v>

1097
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:08.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Moose.</v>

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.430
<v Speaker 1>This is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a manly,</v>

1100
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:12.843
<v Speaker 1>manly or breed of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you have to realize that </v>

1101
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:15.424
<v Speaker 1>Australia was a god Damn prison colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are the ancestors of </v>

1102
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>scoundrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all got big films,</v>

1103
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 1>big humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

1104
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:22.804
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a big ass moves that he shot in </v>

1105
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.044
<v Speaker 1>the Yukon and a grizzly bear claimed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they went back to it and the </v>

1106
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear had run off because he saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>them coming I guess.</v>

1107
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:33.583
<v Speaker 1>And so they just stole what they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got the fuck out of there before </v>

1108
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:36.584
<v Speaker 1>they panicked</v>

1109
00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:37.650
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Came back.</v>

1110
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:38.870
<v Speaker 5>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1111
00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.530
<v Speaker 5>they buried the unburied at the dugout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did dig stuff and take stuff out.</v>

1112
00:50:43.531 --> 00:50:44.850
<v Speaker 5>But they were scared while they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1113
00:50:44.851 --> 00:50:45.684
<v Speaker 5>And they got out of there.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I saw it on instagram.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1127
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I was with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wanted to give him a hug.</v>

1128
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.150
<v Speaker 5>That guy he has fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1129
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:31.950

<v Speaker 5>Why did she leave?</v>

1130
00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.980
<v Speaker 5>And there's audio and they didn't share </v>
<v Speaker 5>the audio.</v>

1131
00:51:34.981 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 5>They shared the audio fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was my friend Adam</v>

1132
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.150
<v Speaker 1>with a pistol out wild grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>charging them.</v>

1133
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn it up.</v>

1134
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:47.563
<v Speaker 1>His voicemail.</v>

1135
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a grizzly bear.</v>

1136
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.260
<v Speaker 1>And he's got a gun player and she's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>her cubs and he might charge,</v>

1137
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might charge them the,</v>

1138
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.070
<v Speaker 1>the scariest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The females with cubs.</v>

1139
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in real life too.</v>

1140
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.770
<v Speaker 1>What about the pistol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1141
00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>he's going to pistol out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing,</v>

1142
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:13.390
<v Speaker 1>the pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the wrong size bullets.</v>

1143
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So wouldn't have racked normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So see how it is right now.</v>

1144
00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:18.940
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's discharged all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ammo,</v>

1145
00:52:18.941 --> 00:52:22.780
<v Speaker 1>like his guns out because it's jammed so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even know it's jammed.</v>

1146
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.123
<v Speaker 1>So He's standing out there pointing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun that the only way can get a bullet </v>

1147
00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:29.710
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he opened up the barrel himself,</v>

1148
00:52:29.711 --> 00:52:33.640
<v Speaker 1>stuck the bullet in and then closed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have one shot no matter what.</v>

1149
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:37.470
<v Speaker 1>So the whole magazine wouldn't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was off the.</v>

1150
00:52:37.471 --> 00:52:40.690
<v Speaker 1>The differences in the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ammunition was off.</v>

1151
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1152
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.410
<v Speaker 1>He didn't notice because he doesn't use </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

1153
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:45.990
<v Speaker 1>He's a bow hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only got.</v>

1154
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.670
<v Speaker 1>He got a gun just to protect himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that thing.</v>

1155
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of.</v>

1156
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 5>I cannot believe how excited I just got </v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1157
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 5>Then just talking to him about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1158
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:54.584
<v Speaker 5>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

1159
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 5>monsters are reel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1160
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 5>when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that thing was charging me,</v>

1161
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I believe.</v>

1162
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:07.520
<v Speaker 5>Did he talk about it on the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you talked about the way it was</v>

1163
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 5>charged him with the hair was popping up</v>
<v Speaker 5>on it and you could see it.</v>

1164
00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

1165
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:11.903
<v Speaker 1>it false charged him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've charged him and stopped within </v>

1166
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 1>five yards of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1168
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's a giant female grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1169
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.163
<v Speaker 5>that would just tear you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only one is trying to get you to do </v>

1170
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.090
<v Speaker 5>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get you to live live</v>

1171
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 1>because he's trying to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't trust him.</v>

1172
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's closing in on him and looking at</v>

1173
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 1>him and deciding maybe whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a threat and moving in on him so he</v>

1174
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:38.184
<v Speaker 1>can't get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was stuck in this position where </v>

1175
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.900
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had decided that he was a problem.</v>

1176
00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So he was trying to get away and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to a different direction.</v>

1177
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It was cutting him off and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

1178
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And he's got his pistol out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1179
00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

1180
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:54.503
<v Speaker 1>But thinks territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Appalachian trail when I was in </v>

1181
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 1>college and not the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a portion.</v>

1182
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking.</v>

1183
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:01.704
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1184
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You're a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly thing.</v>

1185
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1186
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.573
<v Speaker 1>They're so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen one in the wild except </v>

1188
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 1>once in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen like a big one.</v>

1189
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>The one I saw in Alberta was willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>only like six feet wasn't a big one,</v>

1190
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:20.340
<v Speaker 1>whether it was enough to look in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes and go,</v>

1191
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:21.174
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a different thing because a </v>

1192
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:25.710
<v Speaker 1>black bear doesn't look at you like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1193
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.293
<v Speaker 1>Black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you run into a black bear and that </v>

1194
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:29.131
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked at you like,</v>

1195
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you on the east coast?</v>

1196
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:32.851
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1197
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 1>That's spot bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1198
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is is there's brown bears and </v>

1199
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:39.000
<v Speaker 1>then those are the ones that live on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>

1200
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and then everything that's interior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>called a grizzly bear.</v>

1201
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he gets the name.</v>

1202
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

1203
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1204
00:54:45.491 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 1>That's how it gets the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all brown bears,</v>

1206
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't like a straight up brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear always.</v>

1207
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Usually bigger than a grizzly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have more access to protein.</v>

1208
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:55.943
<v Speaker 1>That's the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thought is that the Kodiak Brown </v>

1209
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:00.410
<v Speaker 1>bears that enormous ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the biggest tall,</v>

1210
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 1>still way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

1211
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.250
<v Speaker 1>11 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.523
<v Speaker 1>My other friend who got attacked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Rinella and he has a podcast </v>

1213
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:09.140
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1214
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:10.043
<v Speaker 1>on a podcast called media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his podcast and it's all about a </v>

1215
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 1>fog neck island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a two part podcast.</v>

1216
00:55:16.861 --> 00:55:17.694
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they shot an elk and then the </v>

1217
00:55:21.061 --> 00:55:21.894
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hung some of it up and they came </v>

1218
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.134
<v Speaker 1>back to get it and after they packed </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it out and when they came back </v>

1219
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 1>at grizzly bear it claimed it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know it.</v>

1220
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So they were trying to pack out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>food or that the rest of the meet.</v>

1221
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.573
<v Speaker 1>And when they did a bear charge down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran through their camp and they said it </v>

1222
00:55:39.551 --> 00:55:42.380
<v Speaker 1>was 11 feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was he with?</v>

1223
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.493
<v Speaker 1>He was with my friend Yonis and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Remy Warren Warren Warren about </v>

1224
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my other friend dirt,</v>

1225
00:55:49.281 --> 00:55:50.114
<v Speaker 1>meth and these and maybe one other guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>going know all these hunters and I've </v>

1226
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>never hunted in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like cameramen.</v>

1227
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.533
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of people and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous 11 foot bear ran through the </v>

1228
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 1>camp and they said it was the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

1229
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It was so different than anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could've expected.</v>

1230
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 1>They said it moves so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's teeth were so close to them.</v>

1231
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.823
<v Speaker 1>They said this like Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he describes that he rainelle is a </v>

1232
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a very well read guy.</v>

1233
00:56:16.921 --> 00:56:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's very eloquent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a degree in journalism.</v>

1234
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's super fucking smart.</v>

1235
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>So when he describes this interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between</v>

1236
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.053
<v Speaker 4>them and the 11 foot coastal brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which like the biggest bears on earth </v>

1237
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 4>next to the Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the polar bears bigger,</v>

1238
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 4>whether like the coastal brown bears of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kodiak,</v>

1239
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 4>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that area.</v>

1240
00:56:37.751 --> 00:56:42.751
<v Speaker 4>There's big as those polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the fucking most by the scariest.</v>

1241
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to save him because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Klondike bars and fucking call you.</v>

1242
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.143
<v Speaker 4>She had the most ever when they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can sniff out through ice that </v>

1243
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.840
<v Speaker 4>there's seals under the ice and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

1244
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.893
<v Speaker 4>You'll just see the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like the wildlife footage and </v>

1245
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:58.894
<v Speaker 4>they'll just sniff ice and then they put</v>
<v Speaker 4>their paws together and they start </v>

1246
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.034
<v Speaker 4>dropping all their body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to crack to crack the ice and </v>

1247
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:08.400
<v Speaker 4>then they'll jump in and just pull out a</v>
<v Speaker 4>seal.</v>

1248
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking nuts.</v>

1249
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we could tap into that part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our brains,</v>

1250
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.040
<v Speaker 2>like there's a part of a human.</v>

00:57:58.261 --> 00:58:00.600
<v Speaker 2>days and realize he's running a marathon</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

1263
00:58:00.601 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Marathon a day,</v>

1264
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:02.720
<v Speaker 5>a marathon a day,</v>

1265
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.120
<v Speaker 4>but let me just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In his defense,</v>

1266
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.253
<v Speaker 4>he would never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would step in and probably say right </v>

1267
00:58:09.821 --> 00:58:12.040
<v Speaker 4>now that's not sustainable for the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>

1268
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 4>but what he does is when he's ramping up</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a big 200,</v>

1269
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 4>200 plus mile race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does a marathon a day.</v>

1270
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Go to the opposite side then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the story of marathon?</v>

1271
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.353
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With a guy went to tell them of the </v>

1272
00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:24.610
<v Speaker 4>victory and</v>

1273
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:25.640
<v Speaker 5>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He died.</v>

1274
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:28.340
<v Speaker 5>He did the marathon that died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's who we do it after,</v>

1275
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:32.640
<v Speaker 5>but that guy was a pussy campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No training marathon.</v>

1276
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.513
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the main message is not that you </v>

1277
00:58:35.781 --> 00:58:36.614
<v Speaker 5>should do marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The message is the best way to kill </v>

1278
00:58:38.361 --> 00:58:41.420
<v Speaker 5>pussies doesn't make him run marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've Read A.</v>

1279
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.900
<v Speaker 5>I've read sweating killed.</v>

1280
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm asked before and I liked that he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's sincere and I get it,</v>

1281
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 4>but he has to pretend to be impressed.</v>

1282
00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:57.650
<v Speaker 5>People tell him I ran two miles today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he</v>

1283
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey brother,</v>

1284
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he thinks six miles</v>

1285
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.553
<v Speaker 5>point blank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think of Bourbon in the </v>

1286
00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:11.851
<v Speaker 5>marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1287
00:59:11.851 --> 00:59:12.990
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's impressive.</v>

1288
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:15.900
<v Speaker 5>Too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cynical.</v>

1289
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:18.390
<v Speaker 5>Being cynical about a dude who wears </v>
<v Speaker 5>cowboy boots.</v>

1290
00:59:18.391 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 5>Most of the days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't be cynical.</v>

1291
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Campaigns is straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not cynical.</v>

1292
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm cynical and I'm saying that I read </v>
<v Speaker 5>those comments and I lacked because he's</v>

1293
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:31.394
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good job to the person that like I ran </v>

1294
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.610
<v Speaker 5>around a 100 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy.</v>

1295
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 5>He's a good guy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>running a marathon.</v>

1296
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.120
<v Speaker 5>That's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1297
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a real impressive trying to tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1298
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:48.110
<v Speaker 5>He's one of my best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guys,</v>

1299
00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:48.944
<v Speaker 5>the nicest guy in the world and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>started out not being able to run for </v>

1300
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:52.754
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He started out doing a mile and fucking </v>

1301
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:55.814
<v Speaker 5>dying and going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell could anybody ever run a </v>

1302
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:58.364
<v Speaker 5>marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he just kept doing it and then </v>

1303
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 5>he got to this point.</v>

1304
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 5>We could run ultra marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He runs 100 miles.</v>

1305
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:04.424
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would definitely think it's </v>

1306
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 5>impressive that you ran a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he knows.</v>

1307
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 5>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows.</v>

1308
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 5>He knows running so well and he's run so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many.</v>

1309
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 5>He knows what somebody who can run a </v>
<v Speaker 5>marathon looks like,</v>

1310
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 5>and then when he saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1311
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:24.600
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking impossible stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you go,</v>

1312
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 5>how long did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

1313
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.690
<v Speaker 5>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

1314
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:31.950
<v Speaker 5>what was really impressive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you know someone,</v>

1315
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:34.964
<v Speaker 5>they've been doing comedy for a year and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they tell you they just did an </v>

1316
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:37.611
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1317
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:38.750
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's impressive.</v>

1318
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.300
<v Speaker 5>But if you just got back from Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1319
01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 5>how much time do you do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did it now.</v>

1320
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:44.061
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1323
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.033
<v Speaker 5>But it is impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone who's like maybe one of your </v>

1324
01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:56.174
<v Speaker 5>opening acts go does an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes in Cleveland somewhere and </v>

<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1326
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.750

<v Speaker 5>It was awesome.</v>

1327
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Like if you tell me that you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1328
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:09.470
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you do.</v>

1329
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:15.390
<v Speaker 5>You're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I did an hour and you're like,</v>

1330
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:16.784
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at you like you're a really a Dick </v>

1331
01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:24.281
<v Speaker 5>for saying you act like you're positive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1332
01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Say if you had big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jay was like,</v>

1333
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.230
<v Speaker 5>I did an hour and Madison like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1334
01:01:31.231 --> 01:01:31.900
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

1335
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.900
<v Speaker 5>It's our hour to an hour anymore because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot to lot to less.</v>

1336
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:45.721
<v Speaker 5>Lots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three,</v>

1337
01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 5>45,</v>
<v Speaker 5>3:42.</v>

1338
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 5>When I first started at $45,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number,</v>

1339
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.700
<v Speaker 5>it was 45.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are time comics from 5:30</v>

1340
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 5>and 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

1341
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.044
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>45,</v>

1342
01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.093
<v Speaker 5>which is an hour and a half show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is most people what they think </v>

1343
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:00.704
<v Speaker 5>their attention span is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like honestly it's kind of </v>

1344
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:04.050
<v Speaker 5>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

1345
01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.070
<v Speaker 5>I think 45,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're just too short to.</v>

1346
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:11.420
<v Speaker 5>Ours is pushing for people's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like I think a 90 minute show.</v>

1347
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:16.090
<v Speaker 5>I think our show is is right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think a 90 minute show I'm saying</v>

1348
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 5>put everything is a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make the mistake</v>

1349
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.903
<v Speaker 1>of doing long sets where I did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup and it was rocking and rolling </v>

1350
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and then I do like q and a's </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people and would go on too long.</v>

1351
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.473
<v Speaker 1>You're going to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree because I know for a fact </v>

1352
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:33.893
<v Speaker 1>that like it's not right for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for you a q and a will be </v>

1353
01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1354
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that we wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1355
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.253
<v Speaker 1>It would be more interesting if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't see an hour and a half a comedy </v>

1356
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if that's the problem.</v>

1357
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff.</v>

1358
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>The problem is how much good stuff do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want all day long,</v>

1359
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.453
<v Speaker 1>which you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants their Dick sucked eight </v>

1360
01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:52.531
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1361
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do things.</v>

1362
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You a counterpoint if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

1363
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.850
<v Speaker 1>If you did an hour and a really solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy and then was like,</v>

1364
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.713
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to do a q and a for </v>

1365
01:03:01.091 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

1366
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be different than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1368
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like a whole festival that we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did the stand up.</v>

1369
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:08.560

1371
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:15.230

<v Speaker 1>If it's polished and good,</v>

1372
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the best you can hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're.</v>

1373
01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 1>None of us are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1374
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say I won't speak for everyone,</v>

1375
01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not doing that right now in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on my 60,</v>

1376
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>so in order to work on my 60 I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do because you're figuring it out,</v>

1377
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but that's the most of what we tour is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not finished.</v>

1378
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:36.443
<v Speaker 1>It's not finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a work in progress is not that 60 </v>

1379
01:03:39.351 --> 01:03:40.184
<v Speaker 1>is the number that you shouldn't pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that like when you think </v>

1380
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>about it as a thing where people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what you've got,</v>

1381
01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>it locked down perfectly from start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish.</v>

1382
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:50.243
<v Speaker 1>You really want an hour and a half and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want your opening acts to do at </v>

1383
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>least 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 minutes,</v>

1384
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

1385
01:03:57.811 --> 01:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>and then I take the rest of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a two minute show.</v>

1386
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like to bring headliners with me.</v>

1387
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Agreeing anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You guys are welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring Tony Hinchcliffe all the time.</v>

1389
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.910

<v Speaker 1>Those guys are headlining.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The funniest motherfucker doing he is,</v>

1391

<v Speaker 1>comedy guy because he should be a </v>

1392
01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>household fucking name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying that forever,</v>

1393

<v Speaker 1>like 1993.</v>

1396

<v Speaker 1>from what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 84 years started out </v>

1401
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing about Ian,</v>

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant writer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>these other different shows and one of </v>

1404
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the things about writing gigs is first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

1405
01:04:52.741 --> 01:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>it's very convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go anywhere.</v>

1406
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>He stay in town and you get paid a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money.</v>

1407
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>You make good money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to pass up on,</v>

1408
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.793
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you're not out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>building your name in different cities </v>

1409
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:08.520
<v Speaker 1>and building up markets and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting out a lot of comedy specials.</v>

1410
01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You only have one cd on team coco </v>
<v Speaker 1>records.</v>

<v Speaker 3>job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his job,</v>

1416
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.190

<v Speaker 3>as a person,</v>

1417
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

1418
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be a better person.</v>

1419
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Like I never had a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1420
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:39.223
<v Speaker 3>I like about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the person when you're riffing </v>

1421
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:41.794
<v Speaker 3>jokes around a crowd and they rely on </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone getting offended sometimes when </v>

1422
01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:47.800
<v Speaker 3>you say something horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but since it's all comics,</v>

1423
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:48.550

1453
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Jeremiah Watkins,</v>

1459
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when did this change?</v>

1460
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.143
<v Speaker 3>When things change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're talking about comics </v>

1461
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that back in the day when we were coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1462
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.053
<v Speaker 3>no one ever gave us props for being </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny and young and right now when did </v>

1463
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:50.950
<v Speaker 3>that change in stand up where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like.</v>

1464
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 3>It became a community where I wanted the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people see people succeed.</v>

1465
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I came up I felt those,</v>

1466
01:07:56.070 --> 01:08:01.070
<v Speaker 3>this weird unnecessary competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>between people because I had come from a</v>

1467
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 3>world of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>

1468
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 3>why are you guys pretending you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>competing?</v>

1469
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:05.913
<v Speaker 3>You're not competing like you just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few people that are going to </v>

1470
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:10.924
<v Speaker 3>get certain roles and things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way to look at it correctly was </v>

1471
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>not that you're competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they look at it correctly,</v>

1472
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 3>in my</v>

1473
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>estimation was that we're helping each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1474
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Like when I see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say you kill,</v>

1475
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:22.933
<v Speaker 1>I get inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see some new bit that's like really </v>

1476
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>well crafted and and and hits me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprises me.</v>

1477
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I get inspired and I think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see comics in a vacuum,</v>

1478
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>like I remember when I was coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go in these weird tours.</v>

1479
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:38.953
<v Speaker 1>We do a weird show and some weird town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a local scene and the local </v>

1480
01:08:41.931 --> 01:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>scene was almost always hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a few scenes that were,</v>

1481
01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:47.680
<v Speaker 1>weren't Hacky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Houston wasn't hacky there.</v>

1482
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of pride and not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacky.</v>

1483
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Boston was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not hacky New Yorkers on Hacky,</v>

1484
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but Florida was hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1485
01:08:55.671 --> 01:08:58.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a few places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few places like that.</v>

1486
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I realized what it was like,</v>

1487
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.473
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anybody good that </v>

1488
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:04.250
<v Speaker 1>they're around.</v>

1489
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:07.850
<v Speaker 1>And I remember how bad I was when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>first started,</v>

1490
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 1>how hacky my ideas were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how shitty they were,</v>

1491
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but I got lucky that I was around guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lenny Clarke and Barry crimmins and</v>

1492
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after that wave it was Louis,</v>

1493
01:09:20.621 --> 01:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k and Mark Marin and there was an,</v>

1494
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:24.613
<v Speaker 1>there was all these guys that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever heard of that were really good but </v>

1495
01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:31.390
<v Speaker 1>super ethical about their material and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really sharp about you.</v>

1496
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 1>You're broke the fuck meter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said fuck too much.</v>

1497
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ruins it for everybody.</v>

1498
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Like they would explain like comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory too.</v>

1499
01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:44.100
<v Speaker 1>That was like really high level stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I remember thinking like,</v>

1500
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't everybody just do that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody?</v>

1501
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Like all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1502
01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:53.411
<v Speaker 1>Why does everybody like treat this as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a famine situation going on</v>

1503
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and there's a small amount of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>

1504
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.133
<v Speaker 1>no bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be in Cleveland every night </v>

1505
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to be in Denver and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in Detroit.</v>

1506
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.130
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to support each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so stupid.</v>

1507
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.323
<v Speaker 1>We're the only people that understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in terms of like what a </v>

1508
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:12.640
<v Speaker 1>bizarre human being it takes to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage or broken windows,</v>

1509
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.680
<v Speaker 1>broken spotlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit.</v>

1510
01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.270
<v Speaker 1>People will know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the change?</v>

1511
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>The change is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>

1512
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:23.480
<v Speaker 1>because before the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

1513
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:24.523
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the next host that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show and Jay Leno retires and </v>

1514
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next cone and,</v>

1515
01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:28.954
<v Speaker 1>but I'm on cable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had this idea of being one </v>

1516
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 1>person who stood out in a limited amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of slots.</v>

1517
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.443
<v Speaker 1>And then the internet came around and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer was there a limited amount of </v>

1518
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:40.210
<v Speaker 1>splott slots instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

1519
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.113
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I first started doing the </v>

1520
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.713
<v Speaker 1>acting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to remember what it was like </v>

1521
01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:49.610
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Internet and everything was on either</v>

1522
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:51.200
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>

1523
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 1>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Fox.</v>

1524
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a few like vh one.</v>

1525
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>MTV things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was famine,</v>

1526
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.273
<v Speaker 1>but they can choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also one person or one of 20 </v>

1527
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1528
01:11:03.141 --> 01:11:03.974
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1529
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you're in or or you're not.</v>

1530
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And this was for MTV and this was for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hbo Comedy Specials and this was for all</v>

1531
01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>these things and it was in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

1532
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 4>people that got through were very high </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality sometimes.</v>

1533
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look back at the comics,</v>

1534
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 4>that become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>became big off hbo.</v>

1535
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:23.860
<v Speaker 4>They have the best record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you add a judge,</v>

1538
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Chris rock had HBO special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis C,</v>

1539
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.393
<v Speaker 4>k.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Carlin Carlin had one a year for </v>

1540
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.610
<v Speaker 4>how long they you put out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>16 for anyone could ever see it again.</v>

1541
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Impossible to comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did a new hour every year</v>

1542
01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.850
<v Speaker 7>and I would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went to one.</v>

1543
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.713
<v Speaker 7>I got to see him run the either the last</v>
<v Speaker 7>one or the second to last one at the </v>

1544
01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:53.810
<v Speaker 7>store.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No fucking I wish.</v>

1545
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.673
<v Speaker 7>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he would run it always the night </v>

1546
01:11:55.731 --> 01:11:56.564
<v Speaker 7>before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I learned later at comedy and Magic </v>

1547
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:59.870
<v Speaker 7>Club,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I live nearby for awhile,</v>

1548
01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:01.063
<v Speaker 7>but he got to see him do it at universal</v>
<v Speaker 7>amphitheatre when that was still a </v>

1549
01:12:04.851 --> 01:12:06.740
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And for his closing bit,</v>

1550
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.070
<v Speaker 7>he had it written down and he told the </v>
<v Speaker 7>6,000</v>

1551
01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.940
<v Speaker 7>person audience he's working at like it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was a fucking 80 person room.</v>

1552
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:16.340
<v Speaker 7>He told 6,400</v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

1553
01:12:16.341 --> 01:12:18.230
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is how I remember this shit.</v>

1554
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:19.700
<v Speaker 7>I got to fucking read it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1555
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:23.480
<v Speaker 7>So then he read the whole last bit </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it was really wordy.</v>

1556
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.100
<v Speaker 7>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like a monologue.</v>

1557
01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.200
<v Speaker 7>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is how I ended up memorizing this.</v>

1558
01:12:27.201 --> 01:12:28.580
<v Speaker 7>So you guys are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen to fucking read it.</v>

1559
01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.070
<v Speaker 7>I got to see him on the court.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He would.</v>

1560
01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:31.904
<v Speaker 7>This is what he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He would write a new monologue </v>

1561
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:34.423
<v Speaker 7>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it would tighten up a little bit </v>

1562
01:12:35.631 --> 01:12:36.700
<v Speaker 7>over the course of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>

1563
01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.140
<v Speaker 7>I've thought this was a dog the whole </v>
<v Speaker 7>time for some reason.</v>

1564
01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:40.640
<v Speaker 7>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just a cord?</v>

1565
01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:42.850
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was losing my leg.</v>

1566
01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.220
<v Speaker 4>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1567
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.063
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a nice dog.</v>

1568
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.903
<v Speaker 4>As it was my thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really thought there was a dog in a </v>

1569
01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.010
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1570
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:51.730
<v Speaker 4>And then I just realized that was a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just so calm.</v>

1571
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Freak out my house because our cat </v>
<v Speaker 4>brings rats in the house.</v>

1572
01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that were so racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>against rats,</v>

1573
01:12:56.841 --> 01:12:59.870
<v Speaker 4>but yet girls get a free pass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a squirrel on the house.</v>

1574
01:12:59.871 --> 01:13:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to put a net over it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring the little fellow outside.</v>

1575
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 4>There is a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to kill everybody that's ever</v>

1576
01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:05.624
<v Speaker 4>met before the fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said the only there was between </v>

1577
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:13.960
<v Speaker 4>squirrels and rats are their tails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not totally true because rats</v>

1578
01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:14.794
<v Speaker 4>carry playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why we have an apprehension </v>

1579
01:13:15.921 --> 01:13:18.830
<v Speaker 4>about them to go fuck himself with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty advice.</v>

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.200
<v Speaker 4>I could be doing a lot more than these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to be doing a lot more?</v>

1603
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the key to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not.</v>

1604
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:21.003
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not to do what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I could get there for an hour of </v>

1605
01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:27.730
<v Speaker 4>running and an hour of weights twice a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

1606
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like this amazing ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>curb.</v>

1607
01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's health.</v>

1608
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a good number.</v>

1609
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.620
<v Speaker 4>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two d?</v>

1610
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Two days of two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two days to 40.</v>

1611
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 4>Five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty five minutes.</v>

1612
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Two days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

1613
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad idea for days.</v>

1614
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:49.590
<v Speaker 4>At half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

1615
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 4>what are we talking about this for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a half an hour.</v>

1616
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1617
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:55.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1618
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.273
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This changed my whole fucking way of </v>

1619
01:14:57.081 --> 01:14:59.320
<v Speaker 4>looking at working out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I gotta do an hour,</v>

1620
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.990
<v Speaker 4>but you can certainly can or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>being Tom,</v>

1621
01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:03.913
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

1622
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 4>You can do on our hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do half an hour hard.</v>

1623
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a DVD that I follow.</v>

1624
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 4>It's called the kettlebell extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardio workout by this Guy Keith Weber,</v>

1625
01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:16.144
<v Speaker 4>who's a past guest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does the dude that is by himself in a </v>

1626
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 4>fucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says a couple different variations,</v>

1627
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:24.340
<v Speaker 4>but one of them he did on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the one he did.</v>

1628
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.160
<v Speaker 4>He just takes a 35 pound kettle bell and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1629
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:29.590
<v Speaker 4>how hard could this be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty five pounds is not heavy,</v>

1630
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.910
<v Speaker 4>but you do it for 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty minutes with that,</v>

1631
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 4>without putting it down to one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>

1632
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy,</v>

1633
01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.540
<v Speaker 4>give you a little breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bought this.</v>

1634
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I bought this because of this mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucker going dark.</v>

1635
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:46.180
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

1636
01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After it's over,</v>

1637
01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I could barely walk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can barely walk.</v>

1638
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:54.661
<v Speaker 4>I was hobbled to my hamstrings and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>quads were destroyed,</v>

1639
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.863
<v Speaker 4>but I did the second to last day I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>15 minute rounds with a guy with myths </v>

1640
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.590
<v Speaker 4>up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1641
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:01.743
<v Speaker 4>You can see other people's stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll see some yellow with the yellow </v>

1642
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:05.203
<v Speaker 4>white stay above 80.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you think about when you were </v>

1643
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.593
<v Speaker 4>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought about I was trying to get my </v>

1644
01:16:09.581 --> 01:16:12.430
<v Speaker 4>legs a rest and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1645
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:13.960
<v Speaker 4>so that was what prompted me to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1646
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 4>And then when I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it was doing it,</v>

1647
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 4>I would just think about points and burt</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I would just point where it was</v>

1648
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.220
<v Speaker 4>a great motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motivator.</v>

1649
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Just one little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just heads up,</v>

1650
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 4>seriously ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're welcome everybody,</v>

1651
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.693
<v Speaker 4>because all of you were beating me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a part of me that definitely </v>

1652
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:34.924
<v Speaker 4>felt very alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true because I never thought </v>

1653
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:39.350
<v Speaker 4>you could ever beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>

1654
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:43.990
<v Speaker 4>Here's what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what I was doing.</v>

1655
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.153
<v Speaker 4>What I was doing was punishing you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I wanted to take you on a dark </v>

1656
01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:50.884
<v Speaker 4>dark</v>

1657
01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 5>of all of them,</v>

1658
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:56.590
<v Speaker 4>your insecurities and all of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts of mortality.</v>

1659
01:16:56.591 --> 01:16:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to take you into a place</v>

1660
01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.593
<v Speaker 5>you could never travel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to go to the bottom of the </v>

1661
01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:04.800
<v Speaker 5>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker.</v>

1662
01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:07.860
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I saw these numbers</v>

1663
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're saying going to do double,</v>

1664
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.880
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1665
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:16.210
<v Speaker 5>And I told you I didn't get me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't get me mad,</v>

1666
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you made me open up the door to the dark</v>

1667
01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1668
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 5>you realize that when I was doing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos,</v>

1669
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 5>they were all for comedy of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

1670
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't matter to me when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>in competition with.</v>

1671
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 5>I did the video where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1672
01:17:31.161 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 5>I saw your numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doubling them.</v>

1673
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 5>I came up with my dog and then I </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretended to lose my dog.</v>

1674
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 5>Everyone thought that was real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1675

<v Speaker 5>She definitely can like the canyon.</v>

1676
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.780
<v Speaker 5>That was so funny because he definitely </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew you were joking,</v>

1677
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.660
<v Speaker 5>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

1678
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Just in serve me to think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>joking serves me right.</v>

1679
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:58.580
<v Speaker 5>It serves me to take you very seriously </v>
<v Speaker 5>and to take her to the dark place.</v>

1680
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:02.120
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard you talked to Nikki glaser.</v>

1681

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>

1717
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:08.140
<v Speaker 5>It seems like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it is is so</v>

1718
01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you're doing is so personal.</v>

1719
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane that you like what we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>brush off.</v>

1720
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>It's way harder for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you.</v>

1721
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:19.833
<v Speaker 1>If you lose a fight and someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespects you or they they in public </v>

1722
01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>sentiment keeps you from getting a title</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot like that.</v>

1723
01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's a significant part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1724
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not used to dealing with public </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

1725
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>They used to dealing with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

1726
01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 1>So the public reaction thing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity.</v>

1727
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.213
<v Speaker 1>It's an afterthought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something an after effect of </v>

1728
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1729
01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:41.694
<v Speaker 1>You become successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to deal with all these </v>

1730
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:44.880
<v Speaker 1>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to dance.</v>

1731
01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

1732
01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor's and natural shit talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great fighter,</v>

1733
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a natural shit talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a buffalo bar?</v>

1734
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1735
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.510

<v Speaker 5>That's what I love about conor Mcgregor.</v>

1736
01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Sanders on.</v>

1737
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.103
<v Speaker 5>That's it's a weird situation that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't had either one of those people </v>

1738
01:21:01.031 --> 01:21:02.650
<v Speaker 5>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to get Bernie recently.</v>

1739
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:05.380
<v Speaker 5>He said no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some fake Bernie contacted us.</v>

1740
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say you got your hat,</v>

1741

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:07.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was.</v>

1743

<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

1745
01:21:11.111 --> 01:21:11.944
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to have you on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it was really not commodity </v>

1746
01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.163
<v Speaker 5>here though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he wants to run for </v>

1747
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.920
<v Speaker 5>president man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would he show his ideas?</v>

1748
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:19.003
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I fucking love by the way </v>

1749
01:21:20.531 --> 01:21:21.364
<v Speaker 5>about conor mcgregor is that he meets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He made me really appreciate the </v>

1750
01:21:25.031 --> 01:21:28.660
<v Speaker 5>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows they're also an entertainer.</v>

1753
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:31.833
<v Speaker 5>there's people that did that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean everyone would probably give </v>

1754
01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.650
<v Speaker 5>credit to know why it works.</v>

<v Speaker 5>something or another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they edit it?</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1782
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 5>There has to be some way for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bounce back from horrible things.</v>

1783
01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

<v Speaker 5>American spirit you are,</v>

1806
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:04.683
<v Speaker 5>that you can come back from all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and managed to like reclaim </v>

<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Washington dc despite everything he </v>

1809
01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 5>went through yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

1810
01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:16.750
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1811

<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1812
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:19.900
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when he said,</v>

1813
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one knows this in that pipe.</v>

1814

<v Speaker 5>at that point.</v>

1819
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:38.810

01:43:07.091 --> 01:43:08.290
<v Speaker 5>I would never turn it against these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

2178
01:43:08.291 --> 01:43:09.670
<v Speaker 5>but for sure we're not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2179
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:10.803
<v Speaker 5>They think if I could turn against him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to kill the king of Judah </v>

2180
01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.440
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

2181
01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Got To accept the fact you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>starve to death.</v>

2182
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:19.653
<v Speaker 5>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to accept it because if there's </v>

2183
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:22.323
<v Speaker 5>only four in the woods and we're stuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the top of a mountain and no one's </v>

2184
01:43:26.531 --> 01:43:27.364
<v Speaker 5>gotten to us yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the odds they're going to get </v>

2185
01:43:28.571 --> 01:43:29.350
<v Speaker 5>to us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2186
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 5>How much time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have left,</v>

2187
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:33.310
<v Speaker 5>like 30 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If everything goes great,</v>

2188
01:43:33.311 --> 01:43:35.410
<v Speaker 5>truth is are you would wither away </v>
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

2189
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the real truth.</v>

2190
01:43:36.581 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 5>I've just been thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tried to say immediately,</v>

2191
01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.630
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see what's on both of your minds.</v>

2192
01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:42.010
<v Speaker 5>You're all thinking of killing each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2193
01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.050
<v Speaker 5>I get it from both points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we do this,</v>

2194
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.360
<v Speaker 5>we're never going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I propose a truce.</v>

2195
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go hot food.</v>

2196
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Start to fire the cook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously Tom,</v>

2197
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.553
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause football is just trying to take </v>

2198
01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:56.670
<v Speaker 5>you know a lot about that.</v>

2199
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:03.623
<v Speaker 5>It was just us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just us living in the woods world went </v>

2200
01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 5>to shit and we're like on an episode of </v>
<v Speaker 5>life below zero.</v>

2201
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 5>We live in some sort of fucking house </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we have to put together ourselves.</v>

2202
01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 5>We'll make it just like we got through </v>
<v Speaker 5>this weird month.</v>

2203
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:19.243
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking strange about being a </v>

2204
01:44:21.501 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Speaker 5>person is that you don't know what your </v>
<v Speaker 5>boundaries are,</v>

2205
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:27.110
<v Speaker 5>you just know what you do most of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2206
01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:32.030
<v Speaker 5>so all of a sudden when something comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>up that requires way more of what you're</v>

2207
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:36.030
<v Speaker 5>used to putting in a more way more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jude,</v>

2208
01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:38.270
<v Speaker 5>but isn't that fucking with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective at all?</v>

2209
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:47.510
<v Speaker 5>Being a fucking tournament already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are middle aged comedians of course.</v>

2210
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 5>So you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing enough.</v>

2211
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:58.190
<v Speaker 5>I think you already go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing enough already.</v>

2212
01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.053
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then when you have that thought and </v>

2213
01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:04.931
<v Speaker 5>you do a month like that and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really not doing it real.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and then it's also a combination of all </v>

2216

<v Speaker 5>those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck white chewing gum.</v>

2217
01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:24.330

<v Speaker 5>that's fucking impressive.</v>

2218
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:35.170
<v Speaker 5>Bazooka bubble pop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No bubblicious even better than Bazooka.</v>

2237
01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Went up to the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heart rate's still on,</v>

2238
01:46:36.141 --> 01:46:37.540
<v Speaker 5>still in the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

2239
01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't hide it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sat down,</v>

2240
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.100
<v Speaker 5>it got up to the green,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never gotten to the yellow.</v>

2241
01:46:43.101 --> 01:46:44.180
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>

2242
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 5>when I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't moving out of the gray.</v>

2243
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 5>His sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're watching.</v>

2244
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 5>I had to</v>

2245
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:50.950
<v Speaker 2>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2246
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.863
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had turned off the Bluetooth because </v>

2247
01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:54.324
<v Speaker 2>it was based on my headset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just worked off and it cut off the </v>

2248
01:46:56.701 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>monitor and so I thought it was a dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2249
01:46:59.090 --> 01:47:00.860
<v Speaker 2>it cut off the Monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Your Bluetooth was on,</v>

2250
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it didn't register points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2251
01:47:02.401 --> 01:47:02.741
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2252
01:47:02.741 --> 01:47:03.280
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2253
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.850
<v Speaker 2>So you can't have headset but you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had sets.</v>

2254
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:07.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2255
01:47:07.311 --> 01:47:07.591
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2256
01:47:07.591 --> 01:47:09.020
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cut off the heads.</v>

2257
01:47:09.021 --> 01:47:10.500
<v Speaker 2>That's how I got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The porn on my phone,</v>

2258
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:13.200
<v Speaker 2>so I cut off the Bluetooth so I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch a porn.</v>

2259
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:14.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2260
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:14.874
<v Speaker 2>I had to sit down like a catcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to squat the Jack off to try to </v>

2261
01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:20.870
<v Speaker 2>burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get some movement going.</v>

2262
01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:21.723
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2263
01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:22.231
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2264
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:23.064
<v Speaker 2>so I'm squatting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pumping up a little bit pumping and </v>

2265
01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 points,</v>

2266
01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:30.150
<v Speaker 2>12 points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was afraid of him register</v>

2267
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.880
<v Speaker 4>terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fun points.</v>

2268
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Points.</v>

2269
01:47:33.381 --> 01:47:34.214

<v Speaker 4>four minutes because you're in the </v>

2270
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 4>green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I wasn't added wrong.</v>

2271
01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:41.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of those Kung Fu classes,</v>

2272
01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:42.594
<v Speaker 4>they make you do a horse dance and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>make you hold it a little while to a </v>

2273
01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.093
<v Speaker 4>horse dance stand like this and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold it really make you stand for like </v>

2274
01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:51.930
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

2275
01:47:51.931 --> 01:47:52.800
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2276

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no bullshit.</v>

2277
01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.393
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of really wacky ideas </v>

2278
01:47:57.050 --> 01:48:01.380
<v Speaker 4>regards to Kung Fu type training and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people would just make up their own</v>

2279
01:48:01.381 --> 01:48:04.920
<v Speaker 4>protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like standard horseshoe course stance,</v>

2280
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.903
<v Speaker 4>stand there for one hour to put your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand over the flame for as long as you </v>

2281
01:48:09.151 --> 01:48:10.440
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also like,</v>

2282
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.920
<v Speaker 4>it's also the same thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>to us this month.</v>

2283
01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Like how much can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2284
01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 4>It was completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make any sense.</v>

2285
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Psycho you fucked it up.</v>

2395
01:53:24.801 --> 01:53:25.634
<v Speaker 3>number one who's hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Curry is vj from MTV and he is known as </v>

2396
01:53:29.931 --> 01:53:32.000
<v Speaker 3>the pod father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guy that started podcasting,</v>

2397
01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 3>the marriage model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her,</v>

2398
01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:39.200
<v Speaker 3>his relationship history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's the,</v>

2399
01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's George Washington.</v>

2400
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Who is Adam?</v>

2401
01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Adam Curry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How early was he was up.</v>

2402
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.180
<v Speaker 3>He faces number one then the first big </v>
<v Speaker 3>one where you were,</v>

2403
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:53.510

<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2405
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.693

<v Speaker 3>Or is that Adam curry definitely is the </v>

2406
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.660
<v Speaker 3>procedure basis according to Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were basically always right.</v>

2407
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Always right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which by the way list or a thing it says</v>

<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2410
01:54:15.070 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in June 2005,</v>

2411
01:54:16.551 --> 01:54:20.090
<v Speaker 3>apple added podcasting to the itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was already going.</v>

2412
01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:20.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2413
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:22.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ricky Gervais' had a red,</v>

2414
01:54:22.301 --> 01:54:24.470
<v Speaker 3>a BBC show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2416
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:29.330

<v Speaker 3>Curry's,</v>

2417
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:33.500
<v Speaker 3>after podcasting was added to itunes </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was.</v>

2418
01:54:33.570 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I was already going as a few talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2419
01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:37.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2420
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Ari's point is valid.</v>

2421
01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:42.170
<v Speaker 3>It was already there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

2422
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:45.630
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about different people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2423
01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:46.483
<v Speaker 3>Started in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's was two years before company </v>

2424
01:54:48.831 --> 01:54:49.664

<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

2425
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.020
<v Speaker 3>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying apple was started and then</v>

2426
01:54:54.021 --> 01:54:59.021
<v Speaker 3>a year later podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just google this for a goof.</v>

2427
01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Who was the very first podcast started?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how.</v>

2428
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:04.670
<v Speaker 3>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where you failed at located.</v>

2429
01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just chime in,</v>

2430
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:10.740
<v Speaker 3>but the ones that come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

2431
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:11.593
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to get to start asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>more questions as I was looking through </v>

2432
01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:14.850
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent excuse making.</v>

2433
01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 3>You're making A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer you get back to the doing,</v>

2434
01:55:17.751 --> 01:55:22.140
<v Speaker 3>which you used to do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2435
01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.013
<v Speaker 3>back to celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under correct thread to start off and </v>

2436
01:55:26.431 --> 01:55:28.850
<v Speaker 3>said it was Internet radio because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to say I.</v>

2437
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:32.960
<v Speaker 3>I was recording Internet radio talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and you were a lot.</v>

2438
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.921
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2439
01:55:33.921 --> 01:55:35.210
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me jump in right now.</v>

2440
01:55:35.211 --> 01:55:36.044
<v Speaker 3>So there's a different suite because </v>
<v Speaker 3>myspace was offering an app on a phone </v>

2441
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.403
<v Speaker 3>where you could do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the money stop for a </v>

2442
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:49.220
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2443
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had a guest,</v>

2444
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 3>who do you think was number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by me?</v>

2445
01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:58.880
<v Speaker 3>What did you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Adam curry gets the credit for.</v>

2446
01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

2447
01:56:00.481 --> 01:56:03.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what the international podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very.</v>

2448
01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I think he invented the name podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2449
01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:09.330
<v Speaker 3>my pointed to him and that wikipedia </v>
<v Speaker 3>article,</v>

2450
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:12.250
<v Speaker 3>he invented the name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jamie.</v>

2451
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something real quick.</v>

2452
01:56:15.751 --> 01:56:18.540
<v Speaker 3>He does the podcast with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was another guy was like a science</v>

2453
01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:22.230
<v Speaker 3>tech guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy named Bob Doyle,</v>

2454
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.450

<v Speaker 3>I had it.</v>

2455
01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:24.973
<v Speaker 3>He was a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it should be noted that Bobby Kelly </v>

2456
01:56:27.901 --> 01:56:30.630
<v Speaker 3>definitely had podcasts way before this.</v>

2621
02:04:59.080 --> 02:04:59.913
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a weird thing that happened for </v>

2622
02:05:01.291 --> 02:05:02.124
<v Speaker 7>a little while where if you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you were to theatrical comics would </v>

2623
02:05:07.141 --> 02:05:10.010
<v Speaker 7>get upset at you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if you,</v>

2624
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.990
<v Speaker 7>if you moved around too much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got physical.</v>

2625
02:05:13.330 --> 02:05:17.190
<v Speaker 7>He acted things out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People would literally like shun you.</v>

2626
02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.810
<v Speaker 7>Like there's a few people have thought.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2627
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:23.310

<v Speaker 7>That was a style for a while.</v>

2628
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:24.143
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing someone talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was in the movie </v>

2629
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 3>comedian Jerry Seinfeld going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a bit,</v>

2630
02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll act it out because if it gets a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger laugh then that's the purpose.</v>

2631
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.660
<v Speaker 3>And I remember feeling vindicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so super physical when I started.</v>

2632
02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a weird thing.</v>

2633
02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:37.893
<v Speaker 7>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would any bell so embraced looking </v>

2634
02:05:39.551 --> 02:05:44.380
<v Speaker 7>like more shit than I do naturally?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2802
02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:21.060
<v Speaker 4>Keep a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

2803
02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:21.953
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you cannot file it into </v>
<v Speaker 4>significance or it's possible though if </v>

2804
02:14:26.371 --> 02:14:29.520
<v Speaker 4>you don't make it very clear that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking Goddamn it,</v>

02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:33.050
<v Speaker 4>but I'm always looking out for your best</v>
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>

<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2808
02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:36.443

<v Speaker 4>Til this point I always thought then I </v>

2809
02:14:39.001 --> 02:14:43.260
<v Speaker 4>was the most vaulted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the way you talk make me think.</v>

2810
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:44.573
<v Speaker 4>He might also be have my understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what someone shared something with </v>

2811
02:14:48.241 --> 02:14:52.560
<v Speaker 4>you that just dies with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you tell me that that dies with me,</v>

2812
02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:53.573
<v Speaker 4>I will never betray you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's true with it out once it's </v>

2813
02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.990
<v Speaker 4>out to everybody and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2814
02:14:57.991 --> 02:15:00.530
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew about that 12 years ago,</v>

2815
02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.180
<v Speaker 4>but there's also different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people telling you something and there's</v>

2816
02:15:05.181 --> 02:15:07.520
<v Speaker 4>stuff where like you make the judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2817
02:15:07.590 --> 02:15:08.490
<v Speaker 4>listen bullshit.</v>

2818
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.050
<v Speaker 4>And then there's stuff where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2819
02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:11.003
<v Speaker 4>this is a little more serious for </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody tells you something and it's </v>

2820
02:15:14.371 --> 02:15:16.350
<v Speaker 4>actually something that could affect </v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

2821
02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:17.213
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a zero percent chance I </v>

2822
02:15:18.721 --> 02:15:19.554
<v Speaker 4>would ever use your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say that I ever told me something </v>

2823
02:15:24.570 --> 02:15:26.210
<v Speaker 4>like severe.</v>

<v Speaker 4>couple kids.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say it this.</v>

2828
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

2829
02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Can we talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if one reality is that sometimes one</v>

2830
02:15:40.681 --> 02:15:42.840
<v Speaker 4>of your friends will say something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's disturbing.</v>

2831
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're not sure if you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do I talk to people?</v>

2837
02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Didn't understand how to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2838
02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.550
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know anybody who'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who did,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2843
02:16:11.581 --> 02:16:14.400
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I never knew anybody who confided in</v>

2844
02:16:14.401 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 4>me that they were thinking of killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2845
02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:20.760
<v Speaker 4>No one is close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you and I were,</v>

2847
02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 4>you and I had spent so much fun time </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So much traveling on the road together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many gigs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We had a lot of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I.</v>

2850
02:16:29.850 --> 02:16:31.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't understand.</v>

02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 4>you were really hilarious comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a professional comedian who doing</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

2856
02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:46.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2857

2858
02:16:49.090 --> 02:16:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>confided.</v>

02:16:50.761 --> 02:16:51.594
<v Speaker 4>That's when you're like,</v>

2860
02:16:53.261 --> 02:16:56.530

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.300
<v Speaker 4>you're fine on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You opened up about some shit that I was</v>

2866
02:17:04.301 --> 02:17:04.990
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2867
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2868
02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:07.073
<v Speaker 4>I can't be responsible for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just based on my own personal judgment </v>

2869
02:17:09.641 --> 02:17:11.830
<v Speaker 4>because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand this that well.</v>

2870
02:17:12.130 --> 02:17:14.260
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to figure out what to do.</v>

2871
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.243
<v Speaker 4>And then I reached out to friends who </v>
<v Speaker 4>told me about psychiatrists and then we </v>

2872
02:17:19.511 --> 02:17:22.590
<v Speaker 4>got together and we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're fine with that.</v>

2873
02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.760
<v Speaker 4>That's making the decision to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2874
02:17:24.761 --> 02:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>that's a good share information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2875
02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:26.950
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2876
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:28.750
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me think about that.</v>

2877
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2878
02:17:30.821 --> 02:17:31.654
<v Speaker 4>My thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to make me find out for </v>

2879
02:17:32.891 --> 02:17:35.110
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell fucking everybody,</v>

2880
02:17:35.410 --> 02:17:36.243
<v Speaker 4>but if you tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I tell you you're going to respect </v>

2881
02:17:37.721 --> 02:17:38.700
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will absolutely spend.</v>

2882
02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:39.553
<v Speaker 4>I think you and I are on the same level </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that where it's not a question of </v>

2883
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.670
<v Speaker 4>what the line is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just know if.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Of course wouldn't come out.</v>

2888
02:17:51.590 --> 02:17:52.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless someone brings it up in </v>

2889
02:17:52.851 --> 02:17:54.320
<v Speaker 2>conversation and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of course this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tell me no barriers so much,</v>

2891
02:17:57.651 --> 02:18:02.651
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sell you or sell you out.</v>

2892

<v Speaker 4>true and I am here.</v>

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.190
<v Speaker 4>They tell me to not say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just got to be clear.</v>

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:17.170
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that level of a friendship </v>
<v Speaker 4>to where somebody goes.</v>

2985
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.823
<v Speaker 2>We never do homework with our children </v>
<v Speaker 2>because our children won't give us what </v>

2986
02:22:43.411 --> 02:22:44.244
<v Speaker 2>they need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll give a stranger what they </v>

3070
02:27:06.390 --> 02:27:07.223
<v Speaker 1>certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain point you cross over </v>

3071
02:27:09.111 --> 02:27:09.944
<v Speaker 1>as a person where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do I have left to have 40 </v>

3072

<v Speaker 1>years left for 50 years.</v>

3073
02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you first have that thought?</v>

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you can have many times.</v>

3075
02:27:20.770 --> 02:27:22.300
<v Speaker 5>Let's say when you took it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sleep.</v>

3076
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 1>30 something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in my thirties,</v>

3077
02:27:25.451 --> 02:27:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I would see my body not responding as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3078
02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:29.900
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3079
02:27:29.901 --> 02:27:30.734
<v Speaker 1>where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when I really started thinking </v>

3080
02:27:32.831 --> 02:27:34.670
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3081
02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:35.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3082
02:27:35.170 --> 02:27:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3083
02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I started seeing like I was working out </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard and uh,</v>

3084
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:41.443
<v Speaker 1>and as a boxing fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always knew when a really good boxer </v>

3085
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.910
<v Speaker 1>got into their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to keep an eye on them.</v>

3086
02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:51.070
<v Speaker 1>They might sour instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3087
02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:51.963
<v Speaker 1>They might get knocked out all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden and they couldn't take a punch </v>

3088
02:27:54.010 --> 02:27:56.140
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this guy named Doug Dewitt,</v>

3089
02:27:56.490 --> 02:27:57.323
<v Speaker 1>he was like this bad ass middleweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just could take a punch like nobody </v>

3090
02:28:00.491 --> 02:28:01.324
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3091
02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:02.253
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy could just bang on the </v>

3092
02:28:04.421 --> 02:28:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Chin and people would be freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3093
02:28:06.730 --> 02:28:08.920
<v Speaker 1>how does this guy take punches like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

3094
02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And then one day he couldn't take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3095
02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:12.543
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a cumulative effect of all the </v>

3096
02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:16.390
<v Speaker 1>punches landed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was also an age,</v>

3097
02:28:16.570 --> 02:28:17.403
<v Speaker 1>like almost all of the great champions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get into their thirties and they </v>

3098
02:28:20.261 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 1>just fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start</v>

3099
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.110
<v Speaker 2>to slide where you freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3100
02:28:24.111 --> 02:28:24.944
<v Speaker 2>at the or I don't know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much did you question hormone </v>

3101
02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:31.910
<v Speaker 2>replacement or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did you freak out about the thought</v>

3102
02:28:31.911 --> 02:28:32.680
<v Speaker 2>of it or you know,</v>

3103
02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:33.513
<v Speaker 1>I didn't freak out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to see like what do smart </v>

3104
02:28:36.151 --> 02:28:38.550
<v Speaker 1>people who studied that think like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>do they think?</v>

3105
02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And they were all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was it there?</v>

3106
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:43.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is like,</v>

3107
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

3108
02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:48.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3109
02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a good doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to just put you on any</v>

3110
02:28:51.931 --> 02:28:52.764
<v Speaker 1>kind of hormone replacement first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing they're going to do is </v>

3111
02:28:55.561 --> 02:28:59.010
<v Speaker 1>exercise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to check your blood,</v>

3112
02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:01.860
<v Speaker 1>they get a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your vitamin levels are going to ask you</v>

3113
02:29:01.861 --> 02:29:03.900
<v Speaker 1>what you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do you sleep?</v>

3114
02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:06.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how stressful is your life?</v>

3115
02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:08.610
<v Speaker 1>They're going to try to sort things out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way first.</v>

3116
02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>That way your body is at a more optimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

3117
02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And for a lot of people that's all they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

3118
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:18.210
<v Speaker 1>They just need more sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less sugar,</v>

3119
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:20.460
<v Speaker 1>less processed foods.</v>

3120
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:22.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a little weight lifting,</v>

3121
02:29:22.650 --> 02:29:24.660
<v Speaker 1>do some squats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts,</v>

3122
02:29:24.661 --> 02:29:27.840
<v Speaker 1>things that boost your testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a 34,</v>

3123
02:29:27.841 --> 02:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>we just tired after work and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick that shit back into gear.</v>

3124
02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Cut out the milkshakes and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

3125
02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably kick it,</v>

3126
02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:37.770
<v Speaker 1>kick it into gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's guys that are like 49,</v>

3127
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:39.930
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>51,</v>

3128
02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:40.793
<v Speaker 1>57 and they're just fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just tired and they go and </v>

3129
02:29:45.791 --> 02:29:47.010
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your options.</v>

3130
02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:48.053
<v Speaker 1>You can keep being tired or you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your testosterone replaced and you're </v>

3131
02:29:52.171 --> 02:29:54.690
<v Speaker 1>not as tired anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He feel like a person.</v>

3132
02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:55.913
<v Speaker 1>You feel like an actual person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a decaying person because </v>

3133
02:29:59.401 --> 02:30:00.234
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of what makes you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decaying person is a body's lack of </v>

3134
02:30:03.871 --> 02:30:06.330
<v Speaker 1>production of hormones and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really important.</v>

3135
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:08.583
<v Speaker 1>They they think this is the case with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that have had head </v>

3136
02:30:10.891 --> 02:30:11.724
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

3137
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:12.623
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the key factor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression for people that have been in </v>

3138
02:30:16.141 --> 02:30:18.300
<v Speaker 1>car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who had been beat up,</v>

3139
02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:21.000
<v Speaker 1>people that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have had a lot of head injuries,</v>

3140
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:24.720
<v Speaker 1>your by stopped producing a lot of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones correctly,</v>

3141
02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:27.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] your pituitary gland gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged.</v>

3142
02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:31.170
<v Speaker 1>So for all those reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at a certain point in time,</v>

3143
02:30:31.171 --> 02:30:36.171
<v Speaker 1>whether it's 50 or 60 or 70 or 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got one except your mortality and to</v>

3144
02:30:37.831 --> 02:30:38.664
<v Speaker 1>accept the idea that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have been discovered </v>

3145
02:30:41.971 --> 02:30:45.840
<v Speaker 1>scientifically that can enhance the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have left.</v>

3146
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:46.703
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you either you either like dive into </v>

3147
02:30:50.971 --> 02:30:51.804
<v Speaker 1>them and listen to science and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment trying to figure out what </v>

3148
02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:58.200
<v Speaker 1>works best for you or you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to you.</v>

3149
02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:03.880
<v Speaker 2>This month was a real introspection into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like watching a.</v>

3150
02:31:04.390 --> 02:31:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I literally was like.</v>

3151
02:31:05.891 --> 02:31:08.680
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my lifestyle.</v>

3152
02:31:08.681 --> 02:31:11.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that I could fix</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I added things.</v>

3153
02:31:11.141 --> 02:31:12.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know what I mean.</v>

3154
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Like get off blood pressure medicine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink less,</v>

3155
02:31:15.130 --> 02:31:17.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would.</v>

3156
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They would a good,</v>

3157
02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:24.510
<v Speaker 4>a really ethical doctor would go to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

3158
02:31:24.511 --> 02:31:25.980
<v Speaker 4>That would be the first thing they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to.</v>

3159
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:28.830
<v Speaker 4>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to just fix that because listen,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like if I set a goal and I do go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>kind of float in the water and not know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm doing.</v>

3173
02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:05.693
<v Speaker 4>I think it helps everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just unnerved by the expectations </v>

3174
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:12.330
<v Speaker 4>of any kind of challenges that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>subscribe to.</v>

3175
02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 4>We just decide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3176
02:32:13.681 --> 02:32:16.320
<v Speaker 4>we're all going to agree the whole month</v>
<v Speaker 4>of October,</v>

3177
02:32:16.410 --> 02:32:17.243
<v Speaker 4>we're just going to go crazy and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardio five hours a fucking day and try </v>

3178
02:32:20.371 --> 02:32:23.450
<v Speaker 4>to kill each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing each other.</v>

3179

<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

3180
02:32:27.250 --> 02:32:29.250
<v Speaker 4>It was a 100 day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard that one.</v>

3181

<v Speaker 4>surfing would be really weird.</v>

3183
02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Did you discover anything through </v>
<v Speaker 4>sobriety?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's good pipes,</v>

3186
02:32:44.970 --> 02:32:45.803
<v Speaker 4>but what's more important is </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding how different everything </v>

3187
02:32:50.041 --> 02:32:53.310
<v Speaker 4>feels when you work out for four hours </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it was.</v>

3188
02:32:53.311 --> 02:32:56.070
<v Speaker 4>The average.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you looked at the whole month,</v>

3189
02:32:56.071 --> 02:32:58.900
<v Speaker 4>I probably worked out for hours.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I probably did.</v>

3191
02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:03.000
<v Speaker 4>There was not a five and a half hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3193
02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:07.710
<v Speaker 4>there was quite a few three hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>sessions,</v>

3194
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.850
<v Speaker 4>three hour sessions at night and he did </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of weights also.</v>

<v Speaker 4>tons of time.</v>

3196
02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:17.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me it wasn't even that.</v>

3197
02:33:17.731 --> 02:33:18.564
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have to mix it up or I'll go </v>

3198
02:33:19.861 --> 02:33:20.760
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3199
02:33:20.761 --> 02:33:22.740
<v Speaker 4>There were times at the end of a workout</v>
<v Speaker 4>to where I'd be like,</v>

3200
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:25.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do fucking something else.</v>

3205
02:33:40.801 --> 02:33:41.634
<v Speaker 4>relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While it was like lifting weights and </v>

<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

3245
02:35:29.911 --> 02:35:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So we're not coming last because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big fear and then you say,</v>

3246
02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:34.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still gonna try to beat you though.</v>

3249
02:35:37.290 --> 02:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

02:35:38.191 --> 02:35:39.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

3253
02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:44.393
<v Speaker 2>I have to pay more compliments than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in this because already should </v>

3254
02:35:47.281 --> 02:35:52.281
<v Speaker 2>fear really that you really changed my </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of working out like of going</v>

3255
02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:53.793
<v Speaker 2>the way I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get into spin class and the guard </v>

3256
02:35:55.470 --> 02:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>sat on the saddle and you're paddling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3257
02:35:58.490 --> 02:36:02.190
<v Speaker 2>it will be still out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the way your brain works.</v>

3258
02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:03.120
<v Speaker 2>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3259
02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I used to race with yoga too.</v>

3261
02:36:09.211 --> 02:36:12.280

<v Speaker 2>It's a way a person's brain works.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can't do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>were dead last for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Given up,</v>

3305
02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I saw a marathon one time where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>went the wrong way.</v>

3306
02:38:23.391 --> 02:38:24.224
<v Speaker 5>He was in the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are neck and neck with the guy went the </v>

3307
02:38:25.311 --> 02:38:26.580
<v Speaker 5>wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone had a sec.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is the last like 300 meters.</v>

3311
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 5>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>maybe a mile,</v>

<v Speaker 5>they try to catch up,</v>

3314
02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:36.793
<v Speaker 5>but that wasted space that late and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>started sprinting and he spits it right </v>

3315
02:38:40.131 --> 02:38:40.964
<v Speaker 5>back to that other guy who was already </v>
<v Speaker 5>in first place because he fucking dug </v>

<v Speaker 5>down deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3318
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:49.100
<v Speaker 5>And when you started winning I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was surprised it was it.</v>

3358
02:40:33.210 --> 02:40:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it would be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was worse than surfing.</v>

3359
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to keep birds.</v>

3393
02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Very competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up to a point like the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>With the weight loss challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Stayed steady and Tom one in the end</v>

<v Speaker 1>He tried to sprint towards the end,</v>

3396
02:42:19.370 --> 02:42:22.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was too little too late and Tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking shit the entire time.</v>

3397
02:42:22.121 --> 02:42:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're gonna do.</v>

3398
02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.940
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna fuck off until the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

3399
02:42:24.941 --> 02:42:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Then you can try to catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be too late and he was</v>

3400
02:42:27.191 --> 02:42:27.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3401
02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:29.320
<v Speaker 9>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Bert,</v>

3402
02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:32.760
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if birds will can be </v>
<v Speaker 9>broken.</v>

3403
02:42:32.761 --> 02:42:34.020
<v Speaker 9>Has it been broken before?</v>

3404
02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as well.</v>

3405
02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:38.353
<v Speaker 1>It's the discipline aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with an entire </v>

3406
02:42:41.331 --> 02:42:42.164
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have 31 days of having to get after </v>

3407
02:42:45.741 --> 02:42:46.574
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how often do you get after it </v>

3408
02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:48.530
<v Speaker 1>normally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3409
02:42:48.531 --> 02:42:49.364
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between me and Bert is I </v>

3410
02:42:51.951 --> 02:42:52.784
<v Speaker 1>work out almost every day already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me it's just like those days off </v>

3411
02:42:56.661 --> 02:42:57.494
<v Speaker 1>don't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I've decided to do on my days </v>

3412
02:42:59.361 --> 02:43:00.194
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just do shit that I wouldn't </v>

3413
02:43:00.681 --> 02:43:01.514
<v Speaker 1>normally do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll do the elliptical machine for </v>

3414
02:43:03.471 --> 02:43:07.460
<v Speaker 1>two hours or I'll do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do something else,</v>

3415
02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.220
<v Speaker 1>but the whole time I'm thinking I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to break Bert.</v>

3416
02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm to break.</v>

3417
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:15.833
<v Speaker 9>Think about when you're really trying to</v>
<v Speaker 9>get past that point where you're you </v>

3418
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:22.743
<v Speaker 9>kickboxing or even on an elliptical.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sometimes you got to get angry and you </v>

3419
02:43:27.071 --> 02:43:30.560
<v Speaker 9>think of bird.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right now you're thinking about taking a</v>

3420
02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:31.613
<v Speaker 9>braking breaking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if you guys are all in </v>

3421
02:43:36.721 --> 02:43:37.554
<v Speaker 9>different ways and this is so </v>
<v Speaker 9>interesting to watch because you're </v>

3422
02:43:40.451 --> 02:43:43.420
<v Speaker 9>right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you already work out a lot,</v>

3423
02:43:43.421 --> 02:43:47.650
<v Speaker 9>you're extremely healthy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you're now going to take it your ex.</v>

3424
02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.573
<v Speaker 9>I can see the excitement on all of you </v>
<v Speaker 9>to take this to just an excruciating </v>

3425
02:43:52.391 --> 02:43:53.224
<v Speaker 9>level and because it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it gets obsessive and it gets fun like </v>

3426
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:58.390
<v Speaker 9>you can work,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that's the thing I'm excited to talk</v>

3427
02:43:58.391 --> 02:44:02.230
<v Speaker 9>to you at the beginning of this when </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're still pumped up about it and it's</v>

3428
02:44:02.231 --> 02:44:04.900
<v Speaker 9>like you get a high from working out for</v>
<v Speaker 9>three and a half hours a day,</v>

3429
02:44:04.930 --> 02:44:06.970
<v Speaker 9>17 days from now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to be a beaten man.</v>

3430
02:44:06.971 --> 02:44:07.804
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you are,</v>

3431
02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 9>and you're going to get a surge at the </v>
<v Speaker 9>end when it gets close again,</v>

3432
02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.460
<v Speaker 9>but 17 days.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're right.</v>

3433
02:44:12.461 --> 02:44:13.990

<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's scary.</v>

3452
02:44:49.161 --> 02:44:51.050
<v Speaker 5>You should talk to your side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't,</v>

3453
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.943
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think that it would go </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it went in terms of like my how </v>

3454
02:44:57.411 --> 02:44:58.244
<v Speaker 5>much time everyday I was working out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never thought it would really get to </v>

3455
02:45:01.071 --> 02:45:01.920
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3456
02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:03.343
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought in the beginning we would all </v>

3457
02:45:05.061 --> 02:45:10.061
<v Speaker 5>just have some fun workout an hour a day</v>
<v Speaker 5>and see whose number was higher.</v>

3458
02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:12.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be like real clothes.</v>

3459
02:45:12.310 --> 02:45:12.620
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3460
02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:13.011
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3461
02:45:13.011 --> 02:45:13.844
<v Speaker 5>I wanted it to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I figured Tommy that we talked about it </v>

3462
02:45:15.891 --> 02:45:18.260
<v Speaker 5>with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last week's gonna Sprint.</v>

3463
02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:19.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3464
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:20.383
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

3465
02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:21.530
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was definitely going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>

3466
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:23.960
<v Speaker 5>Then he made that video and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which video?</v>

3467
02:45:23.961 --> 02:45:25.040
<v Speaker 5>Which video?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3468
02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:26.540
<v Speaker 5>When you said you a double major.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3469
02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:28.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My dog.</v>

3470
02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:32.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was another one before that here,</v>

3471
02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:33.990
<v Speaker 5>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woo.</v>

3472
02:45:34.410 --> 02:45:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I gotta come in last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3473
02:45:37.430 --> 02:45:38.890
<v Speaker 5>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on,</v>

3474
02:45:38.891 --> 02:45:39.830
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3475
02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:42.350
<v Speaker 5>you know for a fact that I made those </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos I love.</v>

3476
02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

3477
02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:47.180
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that right now,</v>

3478
02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:51.460
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't help me to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>back then you don't understand.</v>

3479
02:45:51.470 --> 02:45:54.290
<v Speaker 5>You've got to say something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you don't mean it.</v>

3480
02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:56.540
<v Speaker 5>You said it and I don't have to get mad </v>
<v Speaker 5>at you,</v>

3481
02:45:56.810 --> 02:45:57.643
<v Speaker 5>but I have to at least acknowledged </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a transference of energy right </v>

3482
02:46:01.611 --> 02:46:04.240
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to call it anger and says,</v>

3483
02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:06.830
<v Speaker 5>we want to make sure that you don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking win this thing.</v>

3484
02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:11.410
<v Speaker 5>There's no way we're going to go down </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dark road,</v>

3485
02:46:13.660 --> 02:46:14.493
<v Speaker 5>dark.</v>

3486
02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:18.530
<v Speaker 5>This is the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not forget about that.</v>

3487
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:21.110
<v Speaker 5>This is the difference between high </v>
<v Speaker 5>performers.</v>

3488
02:46:21.470 --> 02:46:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

3489
02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Do you all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you all recognize this?</v>

3490
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Because I picked up on it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>

3491
02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Mickey Mantle Gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew we were done pretty quickly.</v>

3492
02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:33.990
<v Speaker 5>You knew what I knew</v>

3493
02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:36.150
<v Speaker 7>done pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were done.</v>

3494
02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:37.313
<v Speaker 7>I knew that when he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though I understood 100 percent </v>

3495
02:46:42.331 --> 02:46:44.910
<v Speaker 7>understood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was his joke that he's like,</v>

3496
02:46:44.911 --> 02:46:46.800
<v Speaker 7>whatever Joseph does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to double up.</v>

3497
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:51.500
<v Speaker 5>You probably knew that he would </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpret that in a competitive way.</v>

3498
02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:55.630
<v Speaker 5>You should do your regular workout and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see if he still paid us.</v>

3499
02:46:55.631 --> 02:46:56.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3500
02:46:56.241 --> 02:46:57.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

3501
02:46:57.050 --> 02:46:58.730
<v Speaker 5>Not Negative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not negative.</v>

3502
02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.300
<v Speaker 5>Not not like what you don't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

3503
02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:06.580
<v Speaker 5>If you really say I'm going to double </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything Joe Does,</v>

3504
02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:07.533
<v Speaker 7>Mike</v>

3505
02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:13.660
<v Speaker 5>Joe's not going to let that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I realized is that I get to take a knee.</v>

3506
02:47:14.050 --> 02:47:16.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to interpret it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you gave him the.</v>

3507
02:47:16.081 --> 02:47:19.640
<v Speaker 5>When you gave me a thought in my head </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're going to try to do that.</v>

3508
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:22.023
<v Speaker 5>His daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his daughter is not calling the cable </v>

3509
02:47:23.801 --> 02:47:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Guy Daddy because he's been gone so long</v>
<v Speaker 5>working out.</v>

3510
02:47:27.010 --> 02:47:29.800
<v Speaker 5>She has no memory of him because you had</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>

3511
02:47:29.801 --> 02:47:30.634
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to double.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to know if you're being </v>

3512
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:39.490
<v Speaker 5>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For me to know,</v>

3513
02:47:39.550 --> 02:47:40.383
<v Speaker 5>I pushed that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to know that you think that </v>

3514
02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:47.350
<v Speaker 5>you're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think really you,</v>

3515
02:47:47.500 --> 02:47:48.333
<v Speaker 5>even though you really know that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't think he can do that 100 </v>

3516
02:47:50.621 --> 02:47:51.670
<v Speaker 5>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but fuck him,</v>

3517
02:47:51.671 --> 02:47:53.950
<v Speaker 5>it can allow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't allow that.</v>

3518
02:47:53.951 --> 02:47:54.784
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put some blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter to take a chance and </v>

3519
02:47:59.870 --> 02:48:02.650
<v Speaker 5>where they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to go through the darkness.</v>

3520
02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:03.813
<v Speaker 5>Can I just say this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we all use burt as a motivation to </v>

3521
02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.920
<v Speaker 5>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's not get lost in this.</v>

3522
02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:14.780
<v Speaker 7>You got to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got real,</v>

3523
02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:16.033
<v Speaker 7>real serious anxiety when you got sick </v>
<v Speaker 7>and know when I realized I could move </v>

3524
02:48:21.621 --> 02:48:25.850
<v Speaker 7>tuber when I realized I could recover.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was like if I got worse,</v>

3525
02:48:25.851 --> 02:48:27.110
<v Speaker 7>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm super sick.</v>

3526
02:48:27.111 --> 02:48:29.120
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But when I realized I was getting better</v>

3527
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:31.460
<v Speaker 7>and I thought I might lose.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3528
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:34.970
<v Speaker 7>I got real anxiety about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3529
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:37.130
<v Speaker 7>I got super nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3530
02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:39.750
<v Speaker 7>but you were the same as me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just don't call him Bert.</v>

3531
02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:41.860
<v Speaker 7>Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Last terrible.</v>

3533
02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:47.360
<v Speaker 7>What kills me is that what you eat,</v>

<v Speaker 7>of course.</v>

3538
02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:01.460
<v Speaker 5>I want to just be very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very clear,</v>

3539
02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:02.433
<v Speaker 5>very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not enter into this contest to </v>

3540
02:49:04.591 --> 02:49:06.520
<v Speaker 5>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think I was coming in.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They fuck up.</v>

3542
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:11.140

<v Speaker 2>I'm challenging those gentlemen in </v>

3545
02:49:16.981 --> 02:49:18.810

3591
02:51:25.410 --> 02:51:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I believed him and there was still a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my brain that was like,</v>

3594
02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:34.633
<v Speaker 2>It was a separate thought though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that I didn't think you were </v>

3595
02:51:38.431 --> 02:51:40.050
<v Speaker 2>lying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still was like,</v>

3596
02:51:40.051 --> 02:51:40.884
<v Speaker 2>my brain would not allow me to just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you didn't want her motel mode </v>

<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

3633
02:53:16.730 --> 02:53:18.660
<v Speaker 5>I got to the point where I thought about</v>
<v Speaker 5>your lives.</v>

3634
02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:19.513
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3636
02:53:23.841 --> 02:53:24.674
<v Speaker 5>responsibility and this is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>effort for me to get to this place and </v>

3637
02:53:27.681 --> 02:53:28.680
<v Speaker 5>do this time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>PM or whatever it is.</v>

3644
02:53:44.961 --> 02:53:45.794
<v Speaker 5>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's an unusual guest and I just </v>

3655
02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:20.660

<v Speaker 3>if we do a,</v>

4055
03:13:34.220 --> 03:13:35.053
<v Speaker 3>we do Madison Square Garden for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>private jet to take us all to fucking </v>

4056
03:13:38.301 --> 03:13:41.930
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This private jet aesthetic is troubling.</v>

4057
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:45.770
<v Speaker 3>You guys are saying you're such trash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking horrible,</v>

4058
03:13:45.771 --> 03:13:47.250
<v Speaker 3>wasteful thing to get to it.</v>

4059
03:13:47.260 --> 03:13:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

4060
03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:51.570
<v Speaker 3>What book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madison Square Garden.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll pay for the private jet together so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll miss you guys.</v>

4063
03:13:57.810 --> 03:14:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Just the three of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How surprising was this month?</v>

4064
03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me it was very,</v>

4065
03:14:02.331 --> 03:14:05.330
<v Speaker 3>very surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep surprising to you though,</v>

4066
03:14:05.390 --> 03:14:07.790
<v Speaker 3>where it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It went so competitive.</v>

4067
03:14:09.410 --> 03:14:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever separated themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully accept you,</v>

4068
03:14:12.770 --> 03:14:13.603
<v Speaker 3>but even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was still like I could maybe catch </v>

4069
03:14:16.461 --> 03:14:17.294
<v Speaker 3>him if he stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you went on a hunting trip </v>

4070
03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:20.900
<v Speaker 3>when you said I'm not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on for the next five days.</v>

4071
03:14:20.990 --> 03:14:22.220
<v Speaker 3>We were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4072
03:14:22.221 --> 03:14:23.054
<v Speaker 3>we got a chance to catch Rogan and pass </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and then when you worked on the </v>

4073
03:14:25.731 --> 03:14:26.120
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

4074
03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:27.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where we're fucked.</v>

4075
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:32.950
<v Speaker 3>But like it was surprising that we kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting the whole way.</v>

4076
03:14:34.100 --> 03:14:35.690
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was unrelenting.</v>

4077
03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:38.360
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't anything I could relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4078
03:14:38.490 --> 03:14:40.910
<v Speaker 3>that was one time that I went to Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the UFC.</v>

4079
03:14:40.911 --> 03:14:44.030
<v Speaker 3>I took three days off and I came back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was in last place.</v>

4080
03:14:44.031 --> 03:14:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

4081
03:14:45.290 --> 03:14:46.123
<v Speaker 3>And then Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you helped me there too because he </v>

4082
03:14:47.391 --> 03:14:48.224
<v Speaker 3>tweeted that he tweeted that I was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>last place and you even posted the </v>

4083
03:14:51.921 --> 03:14:54.410
<v Speaker 3>numbers on instagram and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4084
03:14:54.411 --> 03:14:56.770
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that really motivated you.</v>

4085
03:14:56.900 --> 03:14:58.550
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>

4086
03:14:58.730 --> 03:15:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A silly boy motivated by everything.</v>

4087
03:15:03.111 --> 03:15:07.550
<v Speaker 3>That can be a motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't let something not motivate me.</v>

4088
03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Why would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to not know who you are.</v>

4089
03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4090
03:15:14.370 --> 03:15:18.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I,</v>

4091
03:15:19.390 --> 03:15:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never hear what you say and say,</v>

4092
03:15:21.621 --> 03:15:22.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>

4093
03:15:22.850 --> 03:15:24.720
<v Speaker 3>a great guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

4094
03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:26.780
<v Speaker 3>He was just joking around and doing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>for publicity.</v>

4095
03:15:26.900 --> 03:15:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that later.</v>

4096
03:15:28.460 --> 03:15:29.293
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't help me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it helps me have you tell me </v>

4097
03:15:33.020 --> 03:15:34.790
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4098
03:15:34.820 --> 03:15:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

4099
03:15:37.030 --> 03:15:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

4100
03:15:38.421 --> 03:15:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I did a cruise at the beginning of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>month with Bobby Kelly and I thought,</v>

4101
03:15:42.451 --> 03:15:43.284
<v Speaker 3>I told him about the whole thing started</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking at everyone's numbers </v>

4102
03:15:45.621 --> 03:15:47.510
<v Speaker 3>for the first time and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4103
03:15:47.511 --> 03:15:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Rogan's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taunting him.</v>

4104
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:51.600
<v Speaker 3>And Bobby goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you ever do that?</v>

4105
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I always show man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

4106
03:15:53.401 --> 03:15:55.230
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you know Joe.</v>

4107
03:15:55.290 --> 03:15:55.771
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4108
03:15:55.771 --> 03:15:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I definitely know Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

4109
03:15:57.450 --> 03:15:58.283
<v Speaker 3>never taught him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then halfway through the cruise I </v>

4110
03:16:00.031 --> 03:16:01.380
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I fucked up man.</v>

4111
03:16:02.530 --> 03:16:07.530
<v Speaker 3>He told you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told you stupid dude was a good month</v>

4112
03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:13.850
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

4113
03:16:13.890 --> 03:16:15.500
<v Speaker 3>would it not be like I got it.</v>

4114
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:16.343
<v Speaker 3>I went in like 10 years cooler if I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>just been like super country and </v>

4115
03:16:22.171 --> 03:16:24.870

4116

<v Speaker 3>I do not like the fucking game play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked this bullshit of like talk shit,</v>

4128
03:17:04.561 --> 03:17:07.650

<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>750.</v>

4150
03:18:07.271 --> 03:18:11.190
<v Speaker 3>To be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked putting it aside every October.</v>

4151
03:18:11.220 --> 03:18:14.870
<v Speaker 3>This is my challenge to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your challenge?</v>

4152
03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:18.900
<v Speaker 3>That scared off social media for stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

4153
03:18:18.901 --> 03:18:19.734
<v Speaker 3>We all just agreed with some of us got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sell tickets for a body shots world </v>

4154
03:18:22.111 --> 03:18:23.200
<v Speaker 3>tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4155
03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:26.100
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already know what you can do.</v>

4156
03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:26.993
<v Speaker 3>You could agree to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stay off social media and if you </v>

4157
03:18:28.681 --> 03:18:30.960
<v Speaker 3>have anything that you have to post </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something,</v>

4158
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:36.110
<v Speaker 3>you send it to some sort of a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put it up for you.</v>

4159
03:18:39.230 --> 03:18:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You can do that thing.</v>

4160
03:18:40.540 --> 03:18:41.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sent it to people to send him an </v>

4161
03:18:42.181 --> 03:18:42.961
<v Speaker 3>email and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4162
03:18:42.961 --> 03:18:45.120
<v Speaker 3>send this tomorrow or send this to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as you can.</v>

4163
03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:46.350
<v Speaker 3>If it's after 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>

4164
03:18:46.351 --> 03:18:47.184
<v Speaker 3>Cet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait til it's a good move and you don't </v>

4165
03:18:49.811 --> 03:18:51.790
<v Speaker 3>check it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only move.</v>

4166
03:18:51.850 --> 03:18:54.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not the only move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good move.</v>

4167
03:18:55.210 --> 03:18:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not just a good move for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

4168
03:18:57.250 --> 03:18:58.083
<v Speaker 3>It's a good move for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you shouldn't believe off the </v>

4169
03:19:00.980 --> 03:19:01.813
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Limit the amount of variables you have </v>

4170
03:19:03.491 --> 03:19:07.360
<v Speaker 3>to process because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will process them correctly,</v>

4171
03:19:07.540 --> 03:19:10.390
<v Speaker 3>so you'll be dealing with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that someone would get.</v>

4172
03:19:10.570 --> 03:19:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Some of it you'll get right and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the it'll get wrong,</v>

4173
03:19:13.810 --> 03:19:14.643
<v Speaker 3>but you never know what the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>balances because too much of it is </v>

4174
03:19:16.901 --> 03:19:19.400
<v Speaker 3>coming at you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

4175
03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Can't stop and think for a second which </v>
<v Speaker 3>you love it,</v>

4176
03:19:23.050 --> 03:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>which I don't mind it.</v>

4177
03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:27.020
<v Speaker 3>This is your wheel house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4178
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4179
03:19:27.370 --> 03:19:27.731
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4180
03:19:27.731 --> 03:19:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>

4181
03:19:30.280 --> 03:19:33.100
<v Speaker 3>The same thing can be argued about </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasting.</v>

4182
03:19:33.460 --> 03:19:34.151
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4183
03:19:34.151 --> 03:19:36.700
<v Speaker 3>we're talking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't be talking this much,</v>

4184
03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:39.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that our fans dig and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dig.</v>

4185
03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4186
03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:42.640
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't affect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't affect your own psyche.</v>

4187
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:45.500
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets you start getting angry.</v>

4188
03:19:46.900 --> 03:19:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Don't look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't read comments.</v>

4189
03:19:48.380 --> 03:19:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Don't look at likes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't look at it.</v>

4190
03:19:49.950 --> 03:19:54.950
<v Speaker 3>I argued I would too many people dig it </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

4191
03:19:56.441 --> 03:19:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Not to walk away from it in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know I dig it.</v>

4192
03:19:59.780 --> 03:20:04.210
<v Speaker 3>No need to walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think already saying more like breaks.</v>

4193
03:20:04.750 --> 03:20:05.583
<v Speaker 3>Take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you guys could totally deal with a </v>

4194
03:20:07.721 --> 03:20:08.554
<v Speaker 3>month off of all that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you more than anybody and then you and </v>

4195
03:20:11.891 --> 03:20:15.040
<v Speaker 3>then you have just like not being on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

4196
03:20:15.040 --> 03:20:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Not letting it affect your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just walk outside and view the world for</v>

4197
03:20:18.341 --> 03:20:21.220
<v Speaker 3>what it is for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't kill you.</v>

4198
03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:22.233
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4199
03:20:22.420 --> 03:20:27.420
<v Speaker 3>But you could get your business shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>part done just by email or post this for</v>

4200
03:20:27.791 --> 03:20:29.830
<v Speaker 3>me and then never looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4201
03:20:29.831 --> 03:20:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I'd argue against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do that.</v>

4202
03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:33.733
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely could not and I don't want </v>

4203
03:20:34.961 --> 03:20:36.700
<v Speaker 3>to like it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

4204
03:20:36.700 --> 03:20:37.533
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dig.</v>

4205
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:41.230
<v Speaker 3>I dig listening to you talk to Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 3>slater.</v>

4206
03:20:41.290 --> 03:20:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gives me joy.</v>

4207
03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:45.080
<v Speaker 3>You can have a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4208
03:20:45.081 --> 03:20:45.371
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4209
03:20:45.371 --> 03:20:46.840
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about getting rid of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking phone.</v>

4210
03:20:46.841 --> 03:20:49.270
<v Speaker 3>That's all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would I know Joe had Kelly slater on</v>

4211
03:20:50.410 --> 03:20:51.640
<v Speaker 3>social media?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4212
03:20:51.730 --> 03:20:54.540
<v Speaker 3>but I would say probably the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A great flip phone for a month.</v>

4213
03:20:55.260 --> 03:20:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get off all social media from</v>

4214
03:20:57.341 --> 03:20:58.600
<v Speaker 3>moms that would help you a lot.</v>

4215
03:20:58.900 --> 03:21:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was never a moment where I thought</v>

4216
03:21:00.791 --> 03:21:01.624
<v Speaker 3>that you guys are cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you really didn't stop that </v>

4217
03:21:04.661 --> 03:21:06.040
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

4218
03:21:06.041 --> 03:21:06.491
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4219
03:21:06.491 --> 03:21:07.251
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never know.</v>

4220
03:21:07.251 --> 03:21:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Or even this month I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4221
03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:10.473
<v Speaker 3>the worst case scenario would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody to be holding back where they </v>

4222
03:21:13.271 --> 03:21:16.190
<v Speaker 3>weren't releasing information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

4223
03:21:17.060 --> 03:21:22.060
<v Speaker 3>But I had already prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got so far ahead.</v>

4224
03:21:22.390 --> 03:21:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to save up for like seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't trust that my zone thing.</v>

4225
03:21:25.390 --> 03:21:28.210
<v Speaker 3>It said 13 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 hours.</v>

4226
03:21:28.230 --> 03:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>It lost a good 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time.</v>

4227
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I think you're looking at social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a bad way.</v>

4228
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:37.380
<v Speaker 3>It overall it shifts your to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative.</v>

4229
03:21:39.390 --> 03:21:41.820
<v Speaker 3>What you need to do is shift that and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4230
03:21:42.130 --> 03:21:45.800
<v Speaker 3>what are my positives or negatives?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same as a podcast man.</v>

4231
03:21:45.801 --> 03:21:48.680
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference in instagram and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

4232
03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:50.480
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

4233
03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Because it's information man is sharing </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool show,</v>

4234
03:21:53.721 --> 03:21:55.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4235
03:21:55.160 --> 03:21:58.790
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like sometimes you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been the fan that may be the outsider.</v>

4236
03:21:58.791 --> 03:22:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Has the person lives in this right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to die.</v>

4237
03:22:01.511 --> 03:22:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Like when you do instagrams like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram you did about you eating drugs</v>

4238
03:22:04.791 --> 03:22:09.770
<v Speaker 3>and smoking and drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gave made me giggle post for me,</v>

4239
03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:16.200
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have to be looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses at minute by minute.</v>

4240
03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:19.370
<v Speaker 3>We're all agreeing on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying get off your phone,</v>

4241
03:22:19.371 --> 03:22:20.204
<v Speaker 3>get off social media saying that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the impulse to look at the responses </v>

4242
03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:25.660
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4243
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4244
03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:27.633
<v Speaker 3>I hear somebody go and like Joel said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he brought a response to </v>

4245
03:22:29.991 --> 03:22:30.770
<v Speaker 3>something I did.</v>

4246
03:22:30.770 --> 03:22:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even that video is going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4247
03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:34.820
<v Speaker 3>you should probably kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said it.</v>

4248
03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:35.713
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 68 lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of lights for a comment and then </v>

4249
03:22:38.001 --> 03:22:38.751
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are like,</v>

4250
03:22:38.751 --> 03:22:40.550
<v Speaker 3>how dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know that guy.</v>

4251
03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:41.271
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4252
03:22:41.271 --> 03:22:42.104
<v Speaker 3>you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4253
03:22:42.220 --> 03:22:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I'll just delete it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

4254
03:22:43.970 --> 03:22:45.620
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time.</v>

4255
03:22:45.890 --> 03:22:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you bring it down because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses on fucking instagram.</v>

4256
03:22:50.810 --> 03:22:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did that whole.</v>

4257
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:55.880
<v Speaker 3>It's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five Dude.</v>

4258
03:22:55.881 --> 03:22:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I have people just block people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4259
03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot just getting your mind out</v>

<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't.</v>

4261
03:23:02.660 --> 03:23:05.660
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel good and they want you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to feel shitty too.</v>

4262
03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:06.733
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're right about some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they address it is what the </v>

4263
03:23:08.811 --> 03:23:09.644
<v Speaker 3>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're blurting out and oozing anger </v>

4264
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:16.490
<v Speaker 3>and disproportionate amounts and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>affects everybody around them.</v>

4265
03:23:16.490 --> 03:23:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And it affects all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4266
03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:18.951
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that.</v>

4267
03:23:18.951 --> 03:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>And there's also just the amount of time</v>

<v Speaker 3>before I check my internet or what?</v>

4270
03:23:24.431 --> 03:23:25.264
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of time or spending </v>

4271
03:23:27.561 --> 03:23:28.394
<v Speaker 3>on it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might to you good to see what it </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's overall positive to do it the way </v>

4274
03:23:39.141 --> 03:23:39.974
<v Speaker 3>you're describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that it definitely for sure </v>

4275
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:46.280
<v Speaker 3>plays a part in our business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need it for certain things.</v>

4276
03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:48.170
<v Speaker 3>But like you could do the thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>think I need it for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>is there a way around that?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just when I see someone make my life </v>

4356
03:28:12.170 --> 03:28:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Joseph one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

4357
03:28:13.691 --> 03:28:17.220
<v Speaker 3>This is what it says on his blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure medication.</v>

4358
03:28:17.230 --> 03:28:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4359
03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:20.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know I'm going to stay on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood pressure medication until the </v>

4360
03:28:22.361 --> 03:28:26.420
<v Speaker 3>doctor says to get off it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped you.</v>

4361
03:28:26.440 --> 03:28:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Is there a path to office?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I be going on to lose weight?</v>

4362
03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:32.650
<v Speaker 3>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably have to get to two.</v>

4363
03:28:32.651 --> 03:28:33.484
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

4364
03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Fuck my blood pressure medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

4365
03:28:37.290 --> 03:28:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you on now?</v>

4366
03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:43.480
<v Speaker 3>I was 28 at the end of the contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4367
03:28:43.720 --> 03:28:47.080
<v Speaker 3>probably no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably to 35.</v>

4368
03:28:47.081 --> 03:28:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two.</v>

4369
03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:49.073
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were you at the end of the </v>

4370
03:28:50.740 --> 03:28:53.590
<v Speaker 3>challenge will look to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4371
03:28:53.591 --> 03:28:55.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't really remember to be honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

4372
03:28:55.540 --> 03:28:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I think Jamie pulled that up less than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that buddy.</v>

4373
03:28:59.930 --> 03:29:01.150
<v Speaker 3>He was 13.</v>

4374
03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Then final way in score was two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 to 19 right now.</v>

4375
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you at right now?</v>

4376
03:29:08.561 --> 03:29:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't want to put it back on</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the photo.</v>

4377
03:29:12.010 --> 03:29:12.431
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4378
03:29:12.431 --> 03:29:13.131
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

4379
03:29:13.131 --> 03:29:13.961
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4380
03:29:13.961 --> 03:29:15.850
<v Speaker 3>don't forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't forget this.</v>

4381
03:29:16.180 --> 03:29:21.180
<v Speaker 3>The way in was with a dramatic for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonprofessionals dramatic water cut.</v>

4382
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

4383
03:29:24.160 --> 03:29:24.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4384
03:29:25.080 --> 03:29:27.040
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we basically,</v>

4385
03:29:27.041 --> 03:29:30.010
<v Speaker 3>you can throw on not just one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4386
03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:30.873
<v Speaker 3>but you can throw on 10 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially to what we weighed in it as </v>

4387
03:29:34.721 --> 03:29:35.820
<v Speaker 3>our real weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4388
03:29:37.750 --> 03:29:38.583
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking crazy thing we did last </v>

4389
03:29:43.300 --> 03:29:45.850
<v Speaker 3>year or the year before with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

4390
03:29:45.851 --> 03:29:49.960
<v Speaker 3>And with this one we didn't really take </v>
<v Speaker 3>into account our own personal health.</v>

4391
03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good point.</v>

4392
03:29:51.130 --> 03:29:53.260
<v Speaker 3>That's to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he really honest.</v>

4393
03:29:53.261 --> 03:29:58.180
<v Speaker 3>I had phantom pains and my kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was worried on this one.</v>

4394
03:29:58.250 --> 03:29:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4395
03:29:58.480 --> 03:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last day,</v>

4396
03:30:00.520 --> 03:30:05.520
<v Speaker 3>the last few days I did like somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the range of 535 points.</v>

4397
03:30:06.940 --> 03:30:10.270
<v Speaker 3>You were worried about attaching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sneaky.</v>

4398
03:30:10.920 --> 03:30:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Sneaky disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery Joseph's back.</v>

4399
03:30:15.580 --> 03:30:16.413
<v Speaker 3>And even if you couldn't take about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way I really thought bird was </v>

4400
03:30:19.691 --> 03:30:20.524
<v Speaker 3>asked to try to double me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same feeling like I can't believe you </v>

4401
03:30:22.541 --> 03:30:24.550
<v Speaker 3>really thought that care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>

4402
03:30:24.551 --> 03:30:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if it's a rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened.</v>

4403
03:30:26.380 --> 03:30:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you set it so it made it real.</v>

4404
03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

4405
03:30:33.311 --> 03:30:35.860
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't help me to think that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe I would love.</v>

4406
03:30:35.861 --> 03:30:40.040
<v Speaker 3>It helps your brain every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it helps me to think that you're</v>

4407
03:30:40.041 --> 03:30:44.690
<v Speaker 3>trying to double my score and I'm Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to the dark lands.</v>

4408
03:30:45.060 --> 03:30:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what going dark Bert Kreischer.</v>

4409
03:30:48.170 --> 03:30:51.710
<v Speaker 3>But to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we put on our water.</v>

4410
03:30:51.760 --> 03:30:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I put a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put on our water weight and I think I</v>

4411
03:30:53.751 --> 03:30:56.240
<v Speaker 3>only gained a few pounds on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After October.</v>

4412
03:30:56.241 --> 03:31:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Thirty percent stayed consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lie.</v>

4413
03:31:00.780 --> 03:31:04.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your 2:16</v>

4414
03:31:04.851 --> 03:31:09.851
<v Speaker 3>right now know what I said was to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair.</v>

4415
03:31:11.541 --> 03:31:12.374
<v Speaker 3>That's what Joe said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I said was that we probably gained </v>

4416
03:31:15.050 --> 03:31:15.883
<v Speaker 3>10 pounds back from the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that to 16 will put me at </v>

4417
03:31:18.880 --> 03:31:21.620
<v Speaker 3>26.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I probably gained a few pounds on</v>

4418
03:31:21.621 --> 03:31:23.330
<v Speaker 3>top of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say right now if everything your</v>

<v Speaker 3>2:30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

4420
03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:26.833

<v Speaker 3>but the reason why you pushing back </v>

4421
03:31:28.911 --> 03:31:32.420
<v Speaker 3>against this as [inaudible] your concern</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going to sweep back.</v>

4422
03:31:32.421 --> 03:31:37.421
<v Speaker 3>I knew having gained me telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless,</v>

03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:09.560
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need it to be real.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did more workouts on you doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same work with less points of you.</v>

4455
03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:30.290
<v Speaker 3>That means that a far more workers from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4456

<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

4457
03:33:32.841 --> 03:33:33.674
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to fuck with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do the same workout and then it </v>

4458
03:33:35.651 --> 03:33:37.260

03:33:38.130 --> 03:33:38.963
<v Speaker 2>points we started with you that we are </v>

4590
03:39:50.751 --> 03:39:52.190
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I do is talk shit.</v>

4592
03:39:55.401 --> 03:39:57.050
<v Speaker 3>talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel bad about that?</v>

4593
03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with him in ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying dinner.</v>

03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel weird about dinner?</v>

4595
03:40:05.500 --> 03:40:07.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe became a last man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4596
03:40:07.791 --> 03:40:11.760

<v Speaker 3>I was so worried about coming in last.</v>

4597
03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I came in because you're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

4598
03:40:15.010 --> 03:40:15.843
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to live loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between all of us </v>

4599
03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:18.860
<v Speaker 3>is said when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We want to start dancing.</v>

4605
03:40:32.010 --> 03:40:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Never liked it because I was forced into</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a big big.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Joint pain.</v>

4615
03:40:58.230 --> 03:41:00.770
<v Speaker 3>You definitely changed the tone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really do.</v>

4616
03:41:00.900 --> 03:41:03.650
<v Speaker 3>To change tone changed the party </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>

4617
03:41:03.920 --> 03:41:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I like to get loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that it drives,</v>

4618
03:41:06.021 --> 03:41:06.854
<v Speaker 3>does drive people nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with my friends I trust it that </v>

4619
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:13.060
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to.</v>

4620
03:41:13.180 --> 03:41:14.013
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no mean spiritedness in it for </v>

4621
03:41:16.071 --> 03:41:17.360
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

4624
03:41:27.700 --> 03:41:29.360

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4625
03:41:29.361 --> 03:41:30.194
<v Speaker 3>I don't want your coach billy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy brought other girl or a Kelly </v>

4626
03:41:35.720 --> 03:41:36.553
<v Speaker 3>running coach.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I wanted that belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bad soda.</v>

4628
03:41:40.971 --> 03:41:44.640
<v Speaker 3>I though unfortunately press a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4629
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:50.390
<v Speaker 3>So heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just couldn't keep up.</v>

4630
03:41:50.391 --> 03:41:51.224
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there was any point during </v>

4631
03:41:53.571 --> 03:41:58.490
<v Speaker 3>the month we had a pace that you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have kept up where he had been</v>

4632
03:41:58.491 --> 03:42:00.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4633
03:42:00.051 --> 03:42:04.400
<v Speaker 3>hitting those 500 point day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like day after day after day.</v>

4634
03:42:06.300 --> 03:42:10.280
<v Speaker 3>It is like what we already had planned </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the month.</v>

4635
03:42:10.281 --> 03:42:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4636
03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:14.300
<v Speaker 3>if you had that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had that cruise.</v>

4637
03:42:14.420 --> 03:42:17.900
<v Speaker 3>I had this hunting trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which fortunately ended fairly early,</v>

4638
03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:19.153
<v Speaker 3>but if you were just going somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had somewhere that you had to go </v>

4639
03:42:22.011 --> 03:42:25.670
<v Speaker 3>for 14 days and you couldn't get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout in,</v>

4640
03:42:25.671 --> 03:42:26.504
<v Speaker 3>you are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had just stayed home that whole </v>

4641
03:42:28.401 --> 03:42:30.920
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would've been very different contest,</v>

4642
03:42:31.170 --> 03:42:34.020
<v Speaker 3>but I live without my gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4643
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:35.040
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4644
03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:37.800
<v Speaker 3>We all experienced that.</v>

4645
03:42:37.980 --> 03:42:42.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not using that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's about just saying except that I</v>

4646
03:42:42.871 --> 03:42:45.270
<v Speaker 3>would have loved to have been not on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cruise.</v>

4647
03:42:45.690 --> 03:42:47.700
<v Speaker 3>It was because I get seasick working </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

4648
03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Bobby Kelly as your motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Bobby Kelly sometimes.</v>

4649
03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I thought he wanted to go by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the other way work together.</v>

4650
03:42:57.920 --> 03:42:58.753
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys know you guys did not work out </v>

4651
03:43:00.060 --> 03:43:05.060

<v Speaker 3>working for me and him just smoke cigars</v>

4652
03:43:05.820 --> 03:43:06.653
<v Speaker 3>and that was a hindrance in me is that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke to about scars and so then when I </v>

4653
03:43:11.821 --> 03:43:14.370
<v Speaker 3>got back to Tampa for like one day to </v>

4654
03:43:14.640 --> 03:43:15.473
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4655

<v Speaker 3>I was coughing up bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoke cigars on my way home to the </v>

4656
03:43:18.391 --> 03:43:19.224
<v Speaker 3>comedy cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven nights of those that I was home </v>

4657
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:24.420

<v Speaker 3>makeup than you know.</v>

4661
03:43:33.090 --> 03:43:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Some people are allergic to peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4662
03:43:36.391 --> 03:43:39.700

<v Speaker 3>The Kelly slater did this.</v>

4663
03:43:40.680 --> 03:43:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Conor mcgregor,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is how we did it.</v>

4665
03:43:43.711 --> 03:43:45.480
<v Speaker 3>We did it because we didn't plan on </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

4666
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:46.703
<v Speaker 3>We did not plan on doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Tommy pulled up this idea and we </v>

4667
03:43:48.931 --> 03:43:49.740
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fitness app and we're all like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make any sense.</v>

4694
03:44:52.590 --> 03:44:54.900
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be quantifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tommy nailed it.</v>

4695
03:44:54.901 --> 03:44:55.734
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit would probably be like high </v>

4696
03:44:57.191 --> 03:44:59.280
<v Speaker 3>highly litigious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4697
03:44:59.610 --> 03:45:01.770
<v Speaker 3>There's some lawyers over at my son that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

4698
03:45:02.430 --> 03:45:05.340
<v Speaker 3>you can't incentivize people to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the danger.</v>

4699
03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:06.970
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about</v>

4700
03:45:06.970 --> 03:45:07.803
<v Speaker 1>that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually changed some of my </v>

4701
03:45:09.791 --> 03:45:10.624
<v Speaker 1>opinions on training because I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that where I didn't just do a lot </v>

4702
03:45:14.681 --> 03:45:18.400
<v Speaker 1>of like really go all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did as little,</v>

4703
03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:21.700
<v Speaker 1>even slow down the pace that I run up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hills,</v>

4704
03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but when I would get on the heavy bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I would do kickboxing,</v>

4705
03:45:25.330 --> 03:45:26.163
<v Speaker 1>I had way more endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way more endurance and it was </v>

4706
03:45:29.591 --> 03:45:30.424
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

4707
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:31.383
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy or this is all I haven't </v>

4708
03:45:33.790 --> 03:45:34.623
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I maybe did over the course of the </v>

4709
03:45:36.400 --> 03:45:39.190
<v Speaker 4>entire month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 10 kickboxing workouts,</v>

4710
03:45:39.580 --> 03:45:44.200
<v Speaker 4>but by the end of the month the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing and has gotten way higher.</v>

4711
03:45:44.430 --> 03:45:45.263
<v Speaker 4>It was all just from running and from </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the elliptical machine rowing </v>

4712
03:45:49.661 --> 03:45:52.840
<v Speaker 4>machine and doing all that other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that other shit.</v>

4713
03:45:52.841 --> 03:45:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Just it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

4714
03:45:54.161 --> 03:45:57.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not as exciting to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you do it,</v>

4715
03:45:57.381 --> 03:46:01.150
<v Speaker 4>it ramps up everything around running </v>
<v Speaker 4>hills.</v>

4716
03:46:01.420 --> 03:46:03.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta we gotta keep going.</v>

4717
03:46:03.480 --> 03:46:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Do it once or twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to keep going.</v>

4718
03:46:06.310 --> 03:46:09.530
<v Speaker 4>We have to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep looking at it a little bit.</v>

4719
03:46:09.580 --> 03:46:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to get where we're at.</v>

4720
03:46:11.460 --> 03:46:13.270
<v Speaker 4>We're getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys were too,</v>

4721
03:46:13.271 --> 03:46:14.104
<v Speaker 4>right where you started picking like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of sugar now because it's going to </v>

4722
03:46:16.211 --> 03:46:17.044
<v Speaker 4>fuck over the conquest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing and we should all </v>

4723
03:46:20.021 --> 03:46:20.854
<v Speaker 4>talk about this and maybe we should have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a coach come on and talk to us about if </v>

4724
03:46:24.371 --> 03:46:27.760
<v Speaker 4>we decide to do this again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are our nutritional requirements?</v>

4725
03:46:27.761 --> 03:46:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Because I had one workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 4,000,</v>

4726
03:46:30.161 --> 03:46:31.720
<v Speaker 4>700 calories.</v>

4727
03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:34.593
<v Speaker 4>That's an insane amount of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I never got from like </v>

4728
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:38.503
<v Speaker 4>nutritionists and people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Workout people like legit workouts you </v>

4729
03:46:41.351 --> 03:46:42.850
<v Speaker 4>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4730
03:46:42.851 --> 03:46:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Not like this is the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4731
03:46:44.471 --> 03:46:45.041
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4732
03:46:45.041 --> 03:46:47.620
<v Speaker 4>but for my real life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it twice a week.</v>

4733
03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:48.693
<v Speaker 4>What can I really do and what do I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat a little bit more often that </v>

4734
03:46:51.791 --> 03:46:54.250
<v Speaker 4>would help me instead of like an all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this diet.</v>

4735
03:46:54.320 --> 03:46:56.620
<v Speaker 4>We all talked about this as </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsustainable.</v>

4736
03:46:56.820 --> 03:46:57.653
<v Speaker 4>Totally level was my joint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was what if I told you you had </v>

<v Speaker 4>I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What time is it?</v>

4742
03:47:11.350 --> 03:47:12.183
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't think I could do it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>but after lose a toenail to reason.</v>

4767
03:48:15.681 --> 03:48:17.230
<v Speaker 4>I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

4768
03:48:17.470 --> 03:48:19.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six 40 something,</v>

4769
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:20.583
<v Speaker 4>something my gut on a one off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't ever sit down because I had </v>

4770
03:48:23.231 --> 03:48:28.190
<v Speaker 4>some days where I definitely did like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's put let's possible</v>

4771
03:48:28.190 --> 03:48:29.023
<v Speaker 3>that I did more than that and here's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>two workout days outside of this shit </v>

4772
03:48:33.651 --> 03:48:34.640
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is always fun,</v>

4773
03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:36.710
<v Speaker 3>but here's what we should really think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

4774
03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:40.430
<v Speaker 3>We definitely got our all of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a really,</v>

4775
03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:43.340
<v Speaker 3>really good level of fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4776
03:48:43.400 --> 03:48:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about the shit we did.</v>

4777
03:48:45.470 --> 03:48:46.303
<v Speaker 3>You ran 12 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ran 15 miles and then you rode five </v>

4778
03:48:49.881 --> 03:48:51.020
<v Speaker 3>kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

4779
03:48:51.070 --> 03:48:54.380
<v Speaker 3>you ran a shitload.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got 700 fucking points in a day.</v>

4780
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:57.650
<v Speaker 3>We went crazy boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went crazy.</v>

4781
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:59.000
<v Speaker 3>We went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

4782
03:48:59.070 --> 03:49:04.070
<v Speaker 3>we achieved some very bizarre level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance over the month in comparison</v>

4783
03:49:05.271 --> 03:49:07.670
<v Speaker 3>to the average person that wears these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

4784
03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:09.590
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4785
03:49:09.591 --> 03:49:10.424
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not that we should pat each </v>

4786
03:49:11.391 --> 03:49:12.770
<v Speaker 3>other on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>

4787
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:15.260
<v Speaker 3>We should look at what we did and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

4788
03:49:15.780 --> 03:49:17.320
<v Speaker 3>That was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Thompson.</v>

4789
03:49:17.380 --> 03:49:18.410
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>

4790
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:19.880
<v Speaker 3>So let's stop and think about that for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

4791
03:49:20.040 --> 03:49:22.490
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other thing.</v>

4792
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It happened and I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel good.</v>

4793
03:49:27.060 --> 03:49:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I look in the mirror and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that dude.</v>

4794
03:49:29.721 --> 03:49:34.721
<v Speaker 3>When you were doing the rowing machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was getting video naked on stage.</v>

4795
03:49:37.150 --> 03:49:37.983
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly his and his dick has </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally a hundred percent outreach </v>

4796
03:49:42.891 --> 03:49:45.220
<v Speaker 3>from his pubis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom and I,</v>

4797
03:49:45.230 --> 03:49:48.980
<v Speaker 3>but Bush standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I really thought I was like,</v>

4798
03:49:48.981 --> 03:49:49.814
<v Speaker 3>this is a movie montage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I watched his fucking perfect </v>

4799
03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:57.050
<v Speaker 3>position of Ari's like I got to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

4800
03:49:57.051 --> 03:50:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's really buying into it.</v>

4801
03:50:00.051 --> 03:50:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was changing his life going forward.</v>

4802
03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:03.593
<v Speaker 3>We've got pockets of like kind of work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of your fucking super gym for an </v>

4803
03:50:06.580 --> 03:50:09.790
<v Speaker 3>hour or two because I got to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

4804
03:50:09.930 --> 03:50:12.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect because apps look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>those abs.</v>

4805
03:50:12.170 --> 03:50:13.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect pull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ABS,</v>

4806
03:50:14.680 --> 03:50:15.513
<v Speaker 3>they never looked at it as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>got fucking yellow Sun after the surf </v>

4807
03:50:20.811 --> 03:50:22.520

<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

4922
03:56:04.390 --> 03:56:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Hey you enjoy me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And silver,</v>

4923
03:56:05.350 --> 03:56:07.120
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go fucking kill yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your wife.</v>

4924
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:10.840
<v Speaker 2>It was the best Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went perfectly with it.</v>

4925
03:56:11.330 --> 03:56:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine wine.</v>

4926
03:56:12.720 --> 03:56:13.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that actually can work </v>

4927
03:56:14.891 --> 03:56:18.370
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit and maybe I should work</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit and that's awesome.</v>

4928
03:56:18.371 --> 03:56:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't remember it.</v>

4929
03:56:19.371 --> 03:56:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Also on the 30th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second last day I was running,</v>

4930
03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get points.</v>

4931
03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:24.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a guy in a construction site was on </v>

4932
03:56:26.501 --> 03:56:27.334
<v Speaker 2>a cell phone and he did not look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody I would think would say </v>

4933
03:56:30.491 --> 03:56:32.590
<v Speaker 2>anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

4934
03:56:32.591 --> 03:56:33.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he turns.</v>

4935
03:56:33.701 --> 03:56:34.660
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey buds,</v>

4936
03:56:34.690 --> 03:56:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling back.</v>

4937
03:56:39.490 --> 03:56:42.100
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people knew about it.</v>

4938
03:56:42.101 --> 03:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking my kid's school.</v>

4939
03:56:45.251 --> 03:56:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Dads were coming up to me and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm doing sober October to know shit</v>

4940
03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:50.260
<v Speaker 2>at one more day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more day.</v>

4941
03:56:50.380 --> 03:56:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn?</v>

4942
03:56:52.511 --> 03:56:54.130
<v Speaker 2>What'd you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you feel like you learned?</v>

4943
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:56.343
<v Speaker 2>The competitive drive was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't anticipate getting that crazy </v>

4944
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:02.950
<v Speaker 2>because I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just gonna be us having</v>

4945
03:57:02.951 --> 03:57:05.080
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd work out like last year,</v>

4946
03:57:05.560 --> 03:57:09.990
<v Speaker 2>15 yoga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that extraordinary detail.</v>

4947
03:57:10.180 --> 03:57:12.850
<v Speaker 2>The latter for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The latter part of the month,</v>

4948
03:57:12.851 --> 03:57:13.684
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all did together at like the 28th </v>

4949
03:57:16.050 --> 03:57:16.661
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

4950
03:57:16.661 --> 03:57:17.494
<v Speaker 2>I learned something last year though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly to carried over this year that </v>

4951
03:57:20.261 --> 03:57:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I decided to do nine yoga</v>

4952
03:57:22.190 --> 03:57:24.560
<v Speaker 1>classes in a row to finish off my </v>
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

4953
03:57:24.590 --> 03:57:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I had like a bunch of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a week plus later to go.</v>

4954
03:57:29.260 --> 03:57:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wanted to make it to the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the month,</v>

4955
03:57:31.230 --> 03:57:32.063
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get the 15 in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started decided to do nine in a </v>

4956
03:57:34.131 --> 03:57:39.131
<v Speaker 1>row and when I realized somewhere around</v>
<v Speaker 1>like number seven in a row,</v>

4957
03:57:39.680 --> 03:57:40.191
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4958
03:57:40.191 --> 03:57:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you can just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>

4959
03:57:42.501 --> 03:57:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You need time off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really need time off.</v>

4960
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:48.230
<v Speaker 1>He just needed to keep doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll slow down a little bit.</v>

4961
03:57:48.260 --> 03:57:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll you won't have as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

4962
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but then you just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body will eventually adapt,</v>

4963
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:56.440
<v Speaker 1>but this is way more demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is what,</v>

4964
03:57:56.441 --> 03:57:58.040
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened with this too?</v>

4965
03:57:58.160 --> 03:58:01.070
<v Speaker 1>So what I realized last year by doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine in a row,</v>

4966
03:58:01.190 --> 03:58:02.023
<v Speaker 1>like your body just sort of adapts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then once I started doing like us are </v>

4967
03:58:05.260 --> 03:58:07.670
<v Speaker 1>ramping up the cardio sessions and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4968
03:58:07.700 --> 03:58:08.533
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just decided to get off now I can </v>

4969
03:58:10.731 --> 03:58:12.290
<v Speaker 1>get off now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just stop now.</v>

4970
03:58:12.320 --> 03:58:13.400
<v Speaker 1>An hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time.</v>

4971
03:58:13.410 --> 03:58:16.190
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like 300 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's better?</v>

4972
03:58:16.370 --> 03:58:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Five hours is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see if we can do five hours.</v>

4973
03:58:19.340 --> 03:58:20.173
<v Speaker 1>Like we did an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got to do an hour and a half </v>

4974
03:58:21.471 --> 03:58:22.910
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we're almost there.</v>

4975
03:58:23.040 --> 03:58:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Then we're at three and then we do an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half again.</v>

4976
03:58:25.671 --> 03:58:27.150
<v Speaker 1>There were four and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we're all,</v>

4977
03:58:27.570 --> 03:58:28.750
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

4978
03:58:32.800 --> 03:58:36.290
<v Speaker 3>with this is all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why psychos like Lance Armstrong</v>

4979
03:58:36.291 --> 03:58:39.560
<v Speaker 3>win the Tour de France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just because the steroids,</v>

4980
03:58:39.860 --> 03:58:44.860
<v Speaker 3>because he's a fucking psycho mind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>werewolf.</v>

4981
03:58:46.140 --> 03:58:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Funding figures out a way to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of this daily workout right now,</v>

4982
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:51.703
<v Speaker 3>like whatever lands does today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking blow your fucking mind zones on </v>

4983
03:58:57.171 --> 03:58:58.004
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's over super hyper competitive </v>

4984
03:59:00.860 --> 03:59:02.960
<v Speaker 3>mental part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just to go do it,</v>

4985
03:59:02.961 --> 03:59:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but actually go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to go,</v>

4986
03:59:04.890 --> 03:59:06.800
<v Speaker 3>you need to leave your apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your house,</v>

4987
03:59:06.801 --> 03:59:09.020
<v Speaker 3>and you do go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you want to do this,</v>

4988
03:59:09.021 --> 03:59:10.730
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to go do it now for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of hours.</v>

4989
03:59:10.731 --> 03:59:14.840
<v Speaker 3>That part was like one of the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts about anxiety in the morning.</v>

4990
03:59:15.230 --> 03:59:17.270
<v Speaker 3>You would go off and I'd worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd check.</v>

4991
03:59:17.480 --> 03:59:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Check your scores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scores.</v>

4992
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Scores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only message.</v>

4993
03:59:22.700 --> 03:59:24.830
<v Speaker 3>What'd you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you Limbert Oh,</v>

4995
03:59:26.340 --> 03:59:27.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

4996
03:59:27.150 --> 03:59:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I was asking you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what'd you learn?</v>

4997
03:59:29.451 --> 03:59:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned A.</v>

4998
03:59:32.840 --> 03:59:36.590
<v Speaker 3>I learned that I have a lot more in me </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I ever thought I had.</v>

4999
03:59:36.930 --> 03:59:37.763
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that already is a sneaky fuck </v>

5000
03:59:41.220 --> 03:59:43.040
<v Speaker 3>with a lot more strength than I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

5001
03:59:43.041 --> 03:59:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get angry that they were sandbagging.</v>

5002
03:59:45.771 --> 03:59:47.910
<v Speaker 3>You said I got angry a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5003
03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:52.760
<v Speaker 3>You didn't want anyone to out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same shit you got into.</v>

5004
03:59:52.761 --> 03:59:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I got into two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just with you.</v>

5005
03:59:55.311 --> 03:59:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think you were really upset.</v>

5006
03:59:58.750 --> 04:00:03.580
<v Speaker 3>I was scared of you halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>

5007
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think you really believe you're</v>

5008
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:09.010
<v Speaker 3>going to double me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought that was real hard,</v>

5009
04:00:09.080 --> 04:00:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to.</v>

5010
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:15.110
<v Speaker 3>I heard the words and so I decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe them.</v>

5011
04:00:15.180 --> 04:00:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think,</v>

5012
04:00:16.380 --> 04:00:19.170
<v Speaker 3>believe that you think I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat you already know.</v>

5013
04:00:19.171 --> 04:00:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I never knew you</v>

5014
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:21.870
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never went.</v>

5015
04:00:21.930 --> 04:00:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I never knew Tom will beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat,</v>

5016
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:26.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

5017
04:00:26.600 --> 04:00:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5018
04:00:27.601 --> 04:00:28.380
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

5019
04:00:28.380 --> 04:00:29.213
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were sort of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a misjudgment of the </v>

5020
04:00:31.211 --> 04:00:32.044
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when we went on a hike </v>

5021
04:00:32.521 --> 04:00:33.354
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5022
04:00:33.660 --> 04:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5023
04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:36.383
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course someone that's 100 pounds </v>

5024
04:00:38.221 --> 04:00:39.740
<v Speaker 2>lighter than me would be in better </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

5025
04:00:39.760 --> 04:00:40.920
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

5026
04:00:40.950 --> 04:00:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Fifty pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>

5027
04:00:41.881 --> 04:00:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>

5028
04:00:43.051 --> 04:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned.</v>

5029
04:00:44.910 --> 04:00:45.743
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that I number one thing is </v>

5030
04:00:50.221 --> 04:00:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that I need this comradery to better </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

5031
04:00:53.161 --> 04:00:53.994
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get challenged by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and you have this fun fuckery </v>

5032
04:00:57.241 --> 04:00:58.074
<v Speaker 2>that just happens every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it points you into a place that's </v>

5033
04:01:00.871 --> 04:01:02.430
<v Speaker 2>better for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion.</v>

5034
04:01:02.520 --> 04:01:03.280
<v Speaker 2>It's also really fun</v>

5035
04:01:03.280 --> 04:01:05.920
<v Speaker 4>fun for people listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of people that came up to me</v>

5036
04:01:05.921 --> 04:01:06.401
<v Speaker 4>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5037
04:01:06.401 --> 04:01:07.234
<v Speaker 4>I wish I had friends like you guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you guys are so silly and </v>

5038
04:01:10.151 --> 04:01:11.530
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're both.</v>

5039
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:12.423
<v Speaker 4>You're all of you rather or just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>goofing on each other constantly and </v>

5040
04:01:15.611 --> 04:01:17.980
<v Speaker 4>everybody's laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>howling and it,</v>

5041
04:01:18.280 --> 04:01:22.450
<v Speaker 4>it gives everybody that's listening to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is bizarre sense of comradery.</v>

5042
04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:23.293
<v Speaker 4>Let's get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got through this fuck stupid fucking </v>

5043
04:01:25.780 --> 04:01:30.780
<v Speaker 4>month when we're doing insane amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise saying I'm at the end of it.</v>

5044
04:01:32.330 --> 04:01:33.700
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about trying to.</v>

5045
04:01:33.701 --> 04:01:35.050
<v Speaker 4>When I called her one day and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5046
04:01:35.080 --> 04:01:36.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not athletes,</v>

5047
04:01:36.611 --> 04:01:37.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5048
04:01:37.210 --> 04:01:40.680
<v Speaker 4>what was the best?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not all trained athletes,</v>

5049
04:01:40.690 --> 04:01:40.990
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

5050
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.671
<v Speaker 2>Tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5051
04:01:41.671 --> 04:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>we're just comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

5052
04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:44.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

5053
04:01:44.041 --> 04:01:44.874
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

5054
04:01:45.180 --> 04:01:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's time competition.</v>

5055
04:01:49.880 --> 04:01:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Would you have in second or third in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>final scores had a killer.</v>

5056
04:01:54.680 --> 04:01:57.450
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>J One d,</v>

5057
04:01:57.451 --> 04:01:58.284
<v Speaker 4>One athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy and she probably teaches a gang </v>

5058
04:02:00.330 --> 04:02:01.163
<v Speaker 4>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also she probably never gets out of </v>

5059
04:02:02.761 --> 04:02:07.761
<v Speaker 4>the grange probably in super shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's probably doing it forever.</v>

5060
04:02:08.851 --> 04:02:11.730
<v Speaker 4>She'd probably bury all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

5061
04:02:11.731 --> 04:02:16.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like what we did was we just did a </v>
<v Speaker 4>one month chaos run.</v>

5062
04:02:18.000 --> 04:02:18.833
<v Speaker 4>We all survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we should be careful about </v>

5063
04:02:20.371 --> 04:02:21.204
<v Speaker 4>this because there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is really a potential damage your </v>

5064
04:02:24.001 --> 04:02:26.910
<v Speaker 4>body doing stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun for sure.</v>

5065
04:02:26.970 --> 04:02:27.803
<v Speaker 4>But there's a weird potential for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you hear about stuff like Rhabdo </v>

5066
04:02:30.451 --> 04:02:31.170
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

5067
04:02:31.170 --> 04:02:32.003
<v Speaker 4>What happened to tell you about for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive is so much outweighs the </v>

5068
04:02:35.701 --> 04:02:37.200
<v Speaker 4>potential for the negative that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5069
04:02:37.201 --> 04:02:38.034
<v Speaker 4>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that this is one of the </v>

5070
04:02:39.001 --> 04:02:41.610
<v Speaker 4>big negatives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how any of you guys did</v>

5071
04:02:41.611 --> 04:02:43.320
<v Speaker 4>with cramps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had um,</v>

5072
04:02:43.650 --> 04:02:48.180
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable muscle cramps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last plan for that.</v>

5073
04:02:48.210 --> 04:02:49.760
<v Speaker 4>So I took a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5074
04:02:49.761 --> 04:02:50.594
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally.</v>

5075
04:02:51.020 --> 04:02:54.090
<v Speaker 4>A lot of electrolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took more than I needed.</v>

5076
04:02:54.091 --> 04:02:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I took them with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I added Himalayan salt and water and one</v>

5077
04:02:58.711 --> 04:03:02.400
<v Speaker 4>of the things that I realized when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>add too much Himalayan salt to water,</v>

5078
04:03:02.520 --> 04:03:03.353
<v Speaker 4>your body processes it like food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all that water comes right through </v>

5079
04:03:08.220 --> 04:03:11.490
<v Speaker 4>your butthole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a runaway train,</v>

5080
04:03:12.100 --> 04:03:17.100
<v Speaker 4>like a semi with broken just shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>water</v>

5081
04:03:17.980 --> 04:03:22.570
<v Speaker 3>up gets 34 ounces of water coming flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of your asshole at mach one.</v>

5082
04:03:22.780 --> 04:03:24.070
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

5083
04:03:24.071 --> 04:03:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you drink salt with water together,</v>

5084
04:03:27.220 --> 04:03:28.001
<v Speaker 3>your body goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5085
04:03:28.001 --> 04:03:29.980
<v Speaker 3>this is food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

5086
04:03:29.981 --> 04:03:32.290
<v Speaker 3>We get it Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get it out.</v>

5087
04:03:32.650 --> 04:03:33.483
<v Speaker 3>Woo comes out like water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ass was blown out for a lot of those </v>

5088
04:03:38.231 --> 04:03:39.064
<v Speaker 3>workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hard because the amount of time </v>

5089
04:03:41.831 --> 04:03:43.750
<v Speaker 3>that all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pumping our legs.</v>

5090
04:03:43.751 --> 04:03:45.580
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's Christ.</v>

5091
04:03:45.610 --> 04:03:47.020
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make any sense.</v>

5092
04:03:47.021 --> 04:03:49.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fact that we got close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

5093
04:03:49.690 --> 04:03:52.040
<v Speaker 3>We'll all of us were preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burt,</v>

5095
04:03:58.391 --> 04:04:01.780
<v Speaker 3>of a normal month of exercise for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically everybody,</v>

5096
04:04:01.930 --> 04:04:06.250
<v Speaker 3>it's more than I ever seen one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those boards for 10 months.</v>

5097
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:07.623
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was the 11 five digits </v>

5098
04:04:10.500 --> 04:04:13.840
<v Speaker 3>getting 11,700,</v>
<v Speaker 3>7,000</v>

5099
04:04:13.850 --> 04:04:15.610
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty nuts.</v>

5100
04:04:15.640 --> 04:04:17.890
<v Speaker 3>11,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>is taking to a terrible,</v>

5101
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:22.540
<v Speaker 3>terrible place to get to $11,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

5102
04:04:22.810 --> 04:04:26.710
<v Speaker 3>It was only because we were all sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing each other where it's like,</v>

5103
04:04:28.730 --> 04:04:29.690

<v Speaker 3>To be honest with him,</v>

5105

<v Speaker 3>he's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 something.</v>

5106
04:04:35.501 --> 04:04:37.960
<v Speaker 3>It was like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was also like,</v>

5115
04:04:58.171 --> 04:04:59.670
<v Speaker 7>know how it's going to effect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I was like,</v>

5116
04:05:00.390 --> 04:05:03.000
<v Speaker 7>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can we had a cutoff of 10 eastern?</v>

5117

<v Speaker 7>I just got to the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I checked in,</v>

5118
04:05:05.131 --> 04:05:07.680
<v Speaker 7>I go right to the gym and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

5119
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:12.900
<v Speaker 7>this has been a fucking motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I got to work out right now.</v>

5120
04:05:13.530 --> 04:05:15.570
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I knew you were six,</v>

5121
04:05:15.571 --> 04:05:18.450
<v Speaker 7>700 points ahead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just started and I was like,</v>

5122
04:05:18.480 --> 04:05:20.970
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't lose the bird.</v>

5123
04:05:20.971 --> 04:05:23.100
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

5124
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:24.250
<v Speaker 7>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't.</v>

5125
04:05:24.690 --> 04:05:26.960
<v Speaker 7>And I had major anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't think like,</v>

5126
04:05:27.010 --> 04:05:28.170
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would suck to lose the bird.</v>

5127
04:05:28.410 --> 04:05:31.980
<v Speaker 7>I had like crippling anxiety about it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

5128
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:32.833
<v Speaker 7>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just kept going and I had a few </v>

5129
04:05:34.770 --> 04:05:35.603
<v Speaker 7>hundred points.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was already at least I didn't know if </v>

5130
04:05:37.531 --> 04:05:39.800
<v Speaker 7>you'd sinked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I was at least 307.</v>

5131
04:05:40.770 --> 04:05:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick was a real worry.</v>

5132
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:43.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seeking was a real way to make rules if </v>

5133
04:05:45.381 --> 04:05:47.900
<v Speaker 3>we do this ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

5134
04:05:48.380 --> 04:05:49.213
<v Speaker 3>we got to get blood checked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is a real concern if we doing drugs </v>

5135
04:05:55.341 --> 04:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>or alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>

5136
04:05:55.930 --> 04:05:56.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5137
04:05:56.250 --> 04:05:56.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5138
04:05:56.571 --> 04:05:56.901
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5139
04:05:56.901 --> 04:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean rob doe.</v>

5140
04:05:58.420 --> 04:06:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean people die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5141
04:06:01.690 --> 04:06:05.210
<v Speaker 3>it'd be cool to do this with doctors if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we ever do anything like this again.</v>

5142
04:06:05.240 --> 04:06:06.073
<v Speaker 3>I really think we should do it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors because there was a point where </v>

5143
04:06:08.541 --> 04:06:11.840
<v Speaker 3>I said like at the end there I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having like phantom pains.</v>

5144
04:06:14.490 --> 04:06:17.390
<v Speaker 3>It just just felt 31st was a bad day for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

5145
04:06:17.450 --> 04:06:20.060
<v Speaker 3>That travel day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what you call Joe?</v>

5146
04:06:20.400 --> 04:06:20.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5147
04:06:20.661 --> 04:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called to talk to him first.</v>

5148
04:06:22.960 --> 04:06:27.800
<v Speaker 3>He Jealous First.</v>

5200
04:08:32.711 --> 04:08:37.310
<v Speaker 3>competition is more of a time constraint</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue in like how much time you have,</v>

5227
04:09:37.501 --> 04:09:40.470
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them starts out with a real heavy</v>

<v Speaker 1>commercially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They raise it in.</v>

5265
04:10:58.850 --> 04:11:00.800
<v Speaker 7>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

5268
04:11:05.370 --> 04:11:07.350
<v Speaker 7>They raised them in New Zealand in </v>
<v Speaker 7>particular.</v>

5269
04:11:07.720 --> 04:11:08.553
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>New Zealand has a giant collection of </v>

5270
04:11:10.891 --> 04:11:13.650
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I forgot this one thing sober October.</v>

5271
04:11:14.060 --> 04:11:14.893
<v Speaker 7>It's that thing you've said before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought about it a couple times </v>

5272
04:11:17.281 --> 04:11:18.091
<v Speaker 7>throughout the month.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

5273
04:11:18.091 --> 04:11:18.660
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

5274

<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your inner bitch thing.</v>

5275
04:11:20.160 --> 04:11:23.940
<v Speaker 7>Conquer your inner bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We talk about quit that day to quit.</v>

5276
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:25.620
<v Speaker 7>But everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing.</v>

5277
04:11:25.680 --> 04:11:29.150
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even consider an inner critic </v>
<v Speaker 7>voice everyday.</v>

5278
04:11:29.220 --> 04:11:30.053
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

5279
04:11:30.150 --> 04:11:32.550
<v Speaker 7>these three fucking cock suckers are </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing.</v>

5280
04:11:33.360 --> 04:11:36.670
<v Speaker 7>So I definitely have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was doing a lot of,</v>

5281
04:11:37.220 --> 04:11:39.240
<v Speaker 7>a lot of the month.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was doing two a days.</v>

5282
04:11:39.300 --> 04:11:40.133
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>me too.</v>

5283
04:11:40.440 --> 04:11:42.010
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>

5284
04:11:42.020 --> 04:11:43.890
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm saying like that's.</v>

5285
04:11:44.430 --> 04:11:47.670
<v Speaker 7>That was one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's funny when you have,</v>

5286
04:11:47.671 --> 04:11:50.610
<v Speaker 7>but it's interesting to me was like when</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have friends involved,</v>

5287
04:11:51.290 --> 04:11:53.790
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the consideration of even let's just lay</v>

5288
04:11:53.791 --> 04:11:56.340
<v Speaker 7>here and chill wasn't even a </v>
<v Speaker 7>consideration.</v>

5289
04:11:57.780 --> 04:12:02.070
<v Speaker 7>Just seeing Bert with that strap on </v>
<v Speaker 7>talked and he was like,</v>

5290
04:12:02.071 --> 04:12:07.071
<v Speaker 7>whatever it joe scream into the night </v>
<v Speaker 7>bird.</v>

5291
04:12:08.460 --> 04:12:11.980
<v Speaker 7>I want to get it bothered with cab.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want a Pinot noir.</v>

5292
04:12:12.190 --> 04:12:13.023
<v Speaker 2>Let's get like bone in rib eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do it up tonight as </v>

5293
04:12:16.890 --> 04:12:19.020
<v Speaker 2>fucked days.</v>

5294
04:12:19.610 --> 04:12:20.443
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing that already </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out that I think is really </v>

5295
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:25.460
<v Speaker 1>important for us to honestly think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings.</v>

5296
04:12:25.640 --> 04:12:29.690
<v Speaker 1>We got to a very good state of fitness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should really keep it.</v>

5297
04:12:30.060 --> 04:12:30.893
<v Speaker 1>You really keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do this crazy stupid </v>

5298
04:12:32.991 --> 04:12:33.824
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing where we compare our </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and we have a prize and a belt </v>

5299
04:12:37.731 --> 04:12:38.564
<v Speaker 1>every month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we stayed on this system or </v>

5300
04:12:42.141 --> 04:12:43.350
<v Speaker 1>another system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5301
04:12:43.360 --> 04:12:48.050
<v Speaker 1>to just find out what's the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and good for you and here's the</v>

5302
04:12:48.051 --> 04:12:50.510
<v Speaker 1>thing that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll help other people too.</v>

5303
04:12:50.900 --> 04:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>There's other people would go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5304
04:12:52.121 --> 04:12:53.570
<v Speaker 1>what a beet red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be Joe.</v>

5305
04:12:53.571 --> 04:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I want to be Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be.</v>

5306
04:12:55.240 --> 04:12:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I want to beat these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a part of this.</v>

5307
04:12:57.350 --> 04:12:58.183
<v Speaker 1>And then what they'll do as long as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize this idea of don't fucking </v>

5308
04:13:01.791 --> 04:13:05.660
<v Speaker 1>kill yourself because I don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>close we got to kill ourselves,</v>

5309
04:13:05.840 --> 04:13:07.910
<v Speaker 1>but we definitely got close to breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

5310
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the closest for sure.</v>

5311
04:13:10.620 --> 04:13:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Body broke down.</v>

5312
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:12.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5313
04:13:13.090 --> 04:13:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5314
04:13:15.401 --> 04:13:16.234
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it was Rhabdo that shit super </v>

5315
04:13:17.831 --> 04:13:18.664
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my urine was starting to turn </v>

5316
04:13:20.201 --> 04:13:20.950
<v Speaker 1>darker.</v>

5317
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5318
04:13:22.310 --> 04:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about you broke the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles,</v>

5319
04:13:24.840 --> 04:13:27.870
<v Speaker 2>break a bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bottle,</v>

5320
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you should've seen some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my workout sessions.</v>

5321
04:13:31.091 --> 04:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They were confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're confusing.</v>

5322
04:13:33.641 --> 04:13:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It was like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>

5323
04:13:34.930 --> 04:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>My whole brain had shifted over to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>a weird combat mode.</v>

5324
04:13:40.300 --> 04:13:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange man.</v>

5325
04:13:44.130 --> 04:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's very strange for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

5326
04:13:46.571 --> 04:13:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I looked at Rod,</v>

5327
04:13:48.010 --> 04:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>when red hit 479 points in a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

5328
04:13:50.860 --> 04:13:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is war.</v>

5329
04:13:53.410 --> 04:13:57.740
<v Speaker 2>It was going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's gone for like five,</v>

5330
04:13:57.741 --> 04:13:58.940
<v Speaker 2>six days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5331
04:13:59.030 --> 04:14:01.430
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need Michelle.</v>

5332
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:02.503
<v Speaker 2>I think I could actually do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you were really going to put the </v>

5333
04:14:05.360 --> 04:14:06.193
<v Speaker 2>strap on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no question and she had no </v>

5334
04:14:08.481 --> 04:14:10.730
<v Speaker 2>question about keeping quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trusted her,</v>

5335
04:14:11.480 --> 04:14:13.610
<v Speaker 2>so when I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would your plan have been?</v>

5336
04:14:13.640 --> 04:14:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Just give it to her all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

5337
04:14:15.600 --> 04:14:18.740
<v Speaker 2>She runs 13 miles a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I run.</v>

5338
04:14:21.660 --> 04:14:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When would you,</v>

5339
04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:25.610
<v Speaker 2>when would you have drafted on this that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did that?</v>

5340
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:27.043
<v Speaker 2>Never about a year later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I year I would've kept up on this </v>

5341

<v Speaker 2>whole time?</v>

5344
04:14:35.091 --> 04:14:35.924
<v Speaker 2>Would you have felt comfortable saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>it only if you'd come and let's say </v>

5345
04:14:38.151 --> 04:14:40.490
<v Speaker 2>second or even if you had one you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably want,</v>

5346
04:14:40.500 --> 04:14:43.730
<v Speaker 2>especially if I want and you guys had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for some fucking fancy trip that you</v>

5347

<v Speaker 2>guys all decided on that have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in July.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Gladly</v>

5349
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:48.343
<v Speaker 1>I would give my heart rate monitor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and then it would make a </v>

5350
04:14:50.961 --> 04:14:51.794
<v Speaker 1>separate account for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of count for myself and I try </v>

5351
04:14:54.501 --> 04:14:57.080

<v Speaker 1>but if I can't,</v>

5352
04:14:57.150 --> 04:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>campaigns definitely beat you and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be super humble about it but came in</v>

5353
04:15:03.171 --> 04:15:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and did a great effort.</v>

5354
