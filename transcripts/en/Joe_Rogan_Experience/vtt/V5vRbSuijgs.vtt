1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.143
We're live.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.980
My just like that seems like there should be some sort of a like a chime.
We ring

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.990
<v 1>DME.
It's the</v>

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.780
<v 0>big goal.
Five footer,
not a big gong.</v>

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.040
Big Gowns are obnoxious cause then you're just going to talk,
be a big gun.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.920
If you're going to have like a fucking Cirque de Solei experience and bunch of

7
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.921
dudes come out flipping with fire and do fucking juggle flames or [inaudible] a

8
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.780
good Kuma Tanium so good.
Kuma Tay Bot,

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.600
Dr Dan,
you've got a notebook over there dude,
when you go,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.480
what are you going on here?

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.160
Well I saw you guys with all these note pads so he just wanted to make sure that

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.870
what's going on man.
But 27 years of school I get used to taking notes.

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.770
Dr Dan Angle here with the Obgyn.

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.340
Motherfucking Marco's in the house and we started to sit down and talk.

15
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.750
Shoot the shit we just got done doing 200 and some fucking degrees below zero

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.820
cryo therapy sessions your first time ever in the full body one head immersion.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.490
Yeah,
it's the real one,
right?
Real deal.
Yeah.
You can only get,

18
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.500
those are a couple of places right now.
That's,

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.540
that's ultimately going to be what it is.

20
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.050
It's going to be the difference being the other ones they pour,

21
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:22.520
it's like nitrogen all over your skin,
like a frozen nitrogen sort of thing.

22
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.460
But you can't breathe it.
That's why your head is above.
But this,

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.110
what they do is they freeze the air instead and you go in there and it's just

24
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.460
fucking ungodly,

25
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:36.080
insanely cold and you wear a mouth like a surgeon's mask over your face and

26
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.920
earmuffs and gloves and those rubber.

27
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.560
It's the only time we usually allowed to wear rubber crocs.

28
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:47.270
Those crock clog things and not feel like an asshole.
But um,

29
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.540
what'd you experience with that?
You know,

30
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.100
I think for me a key part is getting that upper half of my body in the,

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410
in the tank,
you know,
we haven't wanted on it.
That's awesome.

32
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.560
For any kind of inflammation in my legs,
my knees,
my,
you know,

33
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.170
my hips is really good.
But then getting that like,

34
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:06.830
so it's cold is getting into your eye sockets and the cold's getting into your,

35
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.340
the temples of your head.
If I find it really relaxing,

36
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:12.560
actually a lot of people think it gives a lot of energy.

37
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:15.740
I found I like deeply relaxing.
After you got out you were really relaxed.

38
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.980
That's interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody seems to have a different reaction to it.

39
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:21.020
Robin was talking about that after it was over,

40
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.810
he was saying that some people feel like uh,

41
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.550
an endorphin crash at the end of the day.

42
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.190
Like you have this big rush when you get out of there and the end of the day

43
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.000
you're very tired,
which I found really weird cause I don't get that at all.

44
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.450
I get out of there and I'm like,
dude,
I feel fucking great.

45
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
I'm addicted to that thing.
Yeah,
I bet your first time doing it ever.

46
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:41.690
Or have you done this time?
You have you done the one that they have it on it?

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.130
Nope.
Today was my debut.
What'd you guys do?
Two and a half minutes.
Like pussies.

48
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.400
So what happened?
I mean to and do the whole three hours at least

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.610
a log time.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

50
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.580
three minutes in,
a few minutes out and then three minutes back in.

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.590
It's a great way to start the day.
It's a very addictive though.

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
If you had one near your house,
man,
you get addicted.

53
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.890
It's more addictive than the one with your head above it for whatever reason.

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.300
Cause there's something about like,
you survive it,
you know?

55
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.350
And like there's like this weird,
like once you get out of there,
it's like,
yes,

56
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.870
I'm back.
Yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
You know,

57
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.850
you started fucking hot foot and around the room.

58
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.100
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

59
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.390
<v 0>You know,
it just,</v>

60
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:31.140
you feel like you survived and you want to go back and do it again.
Yeah.

61
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:32.610
There's a crucible element to it.

62
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.700
Whereas this is something I accomplished for sure.

63
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.490
I feel that we just get out of it.
Dan.

64
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.570
<v 3>Yeah.
I watched my system go into the survival mode.
Yeah.
Like that last minute.</v>

65
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.190
Why does a doctor like it must have been interesting knowing the functions of

66
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:53.160
the body intimately.
Yeah.
I'm always curious about,
uh,

67
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.030
health recovery,
the crucible experience,

68
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.200
putting ourselves in these really extreme situations.
Um,

69
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.700
and then that last minute,
the first one was pretty much a piece of cake.

70
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.730
The second one I was cold straight off and in that last minute I went into these

71
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.650
involuntary shakes and I'm watching my body just jump around like a little race

72
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:20.090
car inside.
I'm like,
oof,
maybe I can just work on tune in this down a little bit.

73
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:23.260
And I'm like,
cause then in jobbing doing whatever I,

74
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.000
Jimi Hendrix was playing in the background,
um,

75
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.030
and nothing was working and it was just like hyper drive.

76
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.580
So I'm just watching this thing going like trippy.

77
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.690
So this is like significant mind body separation.

78
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.310
I had no control over that experience.
So as far as being put in the crucible,

79
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:41.840
like this survival experience,

80
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:46.841
like when I came out that I definitely felt like I had crossed some kind of

81
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.010
threshold of an experience that I wouldn't have had other,
yeah.

82
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.610
<v 0>Have you ever done the ice bath?
You know those,</v>

83
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:57.350
those things we climb into the thing of it's filled with ice and water and

84
00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:00.690
they've on that one.
Yeah.
Those are miserable.
More miserable.
Right.

85
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.500
I think they're more miserable.
Yeah.

86
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.990
Cause your toes get to another level of frozen frozen as well.

87
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.300
It's a wet just soaks window gets deep into your bones.
Yeah.

88
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.060
It feels good though too.
You pop out of that,
you actually feel warmer.

89
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:18.150
I think when you come out of that for some real,

90
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.020
there's like a numbness that happens that makes you feel weirdly warm.

91
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.300
Whereas the Cryo you still feel a little cold when you,

92
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.130
have you ever gone in the Pacific Ocean in like January?
I used to live out here.

93
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:31.470
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'd go out there.
That's chilly.

94
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.220
But you know that feeling like you really shouldn't be warm when you get outside

95
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:39.260
because it's only like 70 degrees outside,
but you're like,
ah,

96
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.680
air that's 70 feels so good.
Yeah,
totally.
There's something about,

97
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.640
we were discussing this about forcing the body to react to a,

98
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.780
the sauna doctor Rhonda Patrick who wrote that really,
um,

99
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.320
really fascinating paper on the effects of thought of Sauna and she's a huge

100
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:03.251
proponent of sauna and the reaction that your body has to this extreme heat of

101
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.030
the sauna so your body compensates in some way for that.

102
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.430
And then when it realizes it's just temporary situation,

103
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.690
you get the benefit of that compensation without actually being in some life

104
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.900
threatening position where your body has to,
you know,

105
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.500
fire up all these protection systems.
Yeah.

106
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:25.340
All kinds of things going on and you got creation in the heat shock proteins.

107
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.250
You've got all of these biochemical processes going on.

108
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:32.960
Plus just that general thing that the body needs,
body needs resistance,
you know,

109
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.210
it needs,
you know,
germs when you're a kid.

110
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.930
It needs to squeeze through the vaginal canal and pick up all the Goo when

111
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.210
you're young to get a climatize.
It needs,
you know,

112
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.730
workouts when you're old and,

113
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.380
and bigger things to stress the muscles and these things to stress the system

114
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.810
all the way across the board.
It's just the way humans are built.

115
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.330
We're not built for a cakewalk.
Yeah.

116
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.510
Bird built to deal with whatever the fuck we have to deal with.

117
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.000
And if you make your body deal with almost nothing,

118
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:03.920
what you get is like a spoiled child.
Right.
That can't handle any sort of,

119
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.850
you know,
any,
any negative or any,
any,

120
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.410
any conflict,
any,
any problems,
anything that's offline.

121
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.290
We're requires character or resolve.
Yeah.

122
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.710
Like you meet those people who grew up in the wilderness and they're like,

123
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.700
they can eat more foods and you can,
they can,
they don't get sick as often.

124
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.950
They're just more resilient.
You know,
like my friend Bodie,

125
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:27.680
you grew up in New Hampshire,
you know,

126
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:32.681
it's like what he can put his body through from just growing up on a farm with

127
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:37.100
no running water and hardly any electricity and just kind of cruising around

128
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.490
from a young age,
climbing mountains and skiing down even when he was freezing.

129
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.020
Like he can deal with shit in a different way than someone who's just been,

130
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.390
put your coat on sweetie.
Make sure your scarf is all tied up.
You know,

131
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.720
it was like a different level of savagery that has actually allowed him to train

132
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:55.750
harder for his sport and you know,

133
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.390
be better because his body was used to dealing with tough shit from an early
age.

134
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.010
Yeah.
That's uh,
it's fascinating because people,
and uh,
you know,
I'm guilty of it.

135
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.560
We want to protect our children from adversity.
Yeah.
But adversities would,

136
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:11.120
builds character.
So it's like,
you know,

137
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:14.890
you want your kids to be safe for,

138
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.080
the only way to make them safe is to put them in danger.
Right.

139
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.890
Everybody that I know that will be fine.

140
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.910
They're all dude's who've gone through some horrific shit.
And their life,

141
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.870
you know,
I know I'll leave that dude will,
he'll be fine.
Right,
right.
Well,

142
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.960
the people that can handle it,
the one that'll,
the ones that will fall apart,

143
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.320
they're the ones who their mom wiped their ass until they're 11 years old.

144
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.890
Fucked,
fucked.
It doesn't work.
Humans are just a flawed thing.

145
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.580
Well,
I mean,
we're kind of designed in that sort of weird way.

146
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.670
We're designed for this savage world.
I mean,
this world is not,

147
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.230
it's beautiful and I love it,

148
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.470
but it's not easy and it was never intended to be easy,
you know?

149
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.830
And so we're designed to have to learn from these and get stronger because of

150
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.290
our environment.
We separate ourselves from the environment.

151
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.530
The human ceases to be what it was originally designed to be,

152
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.410
which is a being that reacts to the pressures of its environment.

153
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.430
You isolate it and then we don't have that resistance anymore and we turn out

154
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:16.350
like a blob.
Well,
there was a study that I tweeted yesterday about that,
um,

155
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.590
sort of a indirect relation to that about young men today that are addicted to

156
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.890
pornography and video games.
And they,

157
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.310
they're going through this masculinity crisis.

158
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.380
So it was this a psychological breakdown of young men in our society today

159
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.920
because they're not going through any real adversity.

160
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.910
They're not going through any real rites of passage pushing themselves,

161
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.600
physically know what they're doing is they're just beating off and playing video

162
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.980
games.
Take this weird world that they live in,

163
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:50.130
whether it's kind of like they're symbiotic relationship with a couch and an

164
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.580
Xbox controller.
Right?
Yeah.
What do you,

165
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.120
what do you think's going to happen with that?
What are the downstream effects?

166
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:00.630
Their doctor Dan?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think they're seeing that study.

167
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.830
<v 3>I haven't seen this study you're talking about,
but that makes perfect sense.
Um,</v>

168
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.090
we're having like two divergent populations where some people are,

169
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.180
are really seeking these kinds of experiences where they're able to stress their

170
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:15.930
system,
grow that,
grow their potential,
become their best selves.

171
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.950
And you have another people that because they don't have a connection to what's

172
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:23.370
happening,
then I have a connection to purpose,
passion,

173
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.130
drive inspiration.
They're not mentored.

174
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:27.750
They're not going through these rites of passage.

175
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.720
They're not going through any kind of,
um,
uh,

176
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.020
supportive exploration of themselves in the world.

177
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.870
They're just finding ways to distract themselves and,

178
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.380
and find some kind of pleasure in the craziness of it all.

179
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.860
So in the midst of that,
you're going to have this,
uh,

180
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:48.600
this massive widening between these two divergent populations.

181
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.650
It's so seductive

182
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.670
<v 0>on the video game though,</v>

183
00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:55.210
because you think you're improving yourself because you have these characters

184
00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:55.460
that are,

185
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.620
that are avatars that are you to an actual real population of people who

186
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:01.510
identify you as that character.

187
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.440
And then the more work you put into that character,
the more you improve it.

188
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:08.800
It improves their skills,
they get richer,
they get bad ass shit,

189
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.010
like the equivalent of rims that spin on their weapons,

190
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:14.710
and then they get level 40,
50,
60,

191
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:17.110
and then you're really swinging a big dick out there.
You know,

192
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:17.944
when you're that big.

193
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.000
So it's this seductive thing of they do feel like they're improving,

194
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.320
but they're not actually.
Yeah.
How do you actualize that in the world?
Well,
is it,

195
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.150
is that the case or was it this,

196
00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:33.151
are we in some sort of a transitionary period between a physical,

197
00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:37.660
biological,
carbon base,
cellular life,
and a digital life?

198
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.620
Because once,
if we really do transition to a digital life,

199
00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:45.790
which there's a lot of speculation from legitimate scientists and people that

200
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:49.720
are looking at the curve of learning and the exponential growth of technology

201
00:11:49.721 --> 00:11:51.220
and they're like,
look,
this is inevitable.

202
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.800
We're not going to be physical beings for much longer.

203
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.830
<v 4>Like it's pretty,</v>

204
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.620
it's pretty obvious that we're going to eventually incorporate with machines and

205
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.790
to the point where the,
the concept of living in a virtual world,

206
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.890
a world where you can just put on these headsets and go into the world of Avatar

207
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.540
and live out this intense,

208
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.550
unbelievably rich existence inside this artificially created world is going to

209
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:19.120
be so much more appealing and attractive.
And that's,

210
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:23.140
I think that's what we're seeing with these kids when they're playing call of

211
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.400
duty or in these other games.

212
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.640
It's so much better than going out and being a regular teenager with no job

213
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:33.520
prospects,
no skills,

214
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.610
no nothing unique about you,

215
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.820
nothing particularly challenging in your life other than,

216
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:45.190
you know,
feeding yourself and getting to bed on time.
You know,

217
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.240
it's just nothing there.

218
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.500
But they can go into this world and this fucking bullets flying overhead and

219
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:54.100
they're all talking on headsets and trying to set up an ambush to go get the

220
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:55.800
enemy and that,
that,
that,
that,
that,

221
00:12:55.801 --> 00:13:00.550
that the helicopters are flying overhead and that's way more exciting.

222
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.770
It's way more exciting.
And this is just the beginnings of this,
this,

223
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.140
this digital world.
I mean there's,

224
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.960
these are artificial realities that they exist in,

225
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.280
but there's so clearly artificial that we don't think of him that way.

226
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:16.720
We think of him as a video game,

227
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.520
but once it becomes something that's indistinguishable once we had something

228
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.050
going on inside your head,
I mean,

229
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:28.051
how many years are we really away from something where you put it on and it has

230
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:32.050
electrodes that react with various,

231
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.080
various areas in your brain where they can stimulate these areas and reproduce

232
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.690
insane visual effects,

233
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.900
physical effects that the feeling of your foot on gravel as you're running down

234
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.060
this beach.
Like you feel it in your feet.
I mean,

235
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.420
how long before they can do that?
It's not that far off.

236
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.460
It's way closer than going to another planet.
It's way closer than,
you know,

237
00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:01.480
setting up a colony on the moon pretty fucking close to doing this.

238
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.060
This is a decade away at most.

239
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.490
<v 5>It's a kind of a weird,
exciting,
but terrifying thought.
Very terrifying.
You know?</v>

240
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.620
I mean you,
you want to thank,
you want to hold out and think,
ah,

241
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.740
the real world will be better.
I know it,
they won't get the smells right,

242
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.710
but like they're little still screwed something up,
you know?

243
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.830
But it's very possible that eventually they can create virtual worlds that will

244
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:29.640
be pretty satisfying.
But I dunno,
I just,
I want to hold out faith.

245
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:31.770
Maybe it's just a desire of the romantic desire.

246
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:36.130
I want to hold out faith that doing something for reals,
for reals,
you know,

247
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.080
feeling your real body underneath you.

248
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:40.740
Or maybe it's just even the knowledge that it's for reals,
for reals.

249
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.800
It just seems like that would be better,
you know?

250
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.540
<v 4>Yeah.
For now.</v>

251
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.680
But if it keep continues to improve and grow,
it's,

252
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.170
it's seems like it's gonna

253
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.080
<v 0>be like way more satisfying live that you're talking about the matrix.</v>

254
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.920
Right.

255
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.920
So then it really depends on who's the puppet master [inaudible] and what the

256
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.460
agenda is to make ms creating the matrix.
Yeah.

257
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.820
And for what outcome or what reason?
Yeah.

258
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:15.170
It could the matrix be something that the user career,
it's,
I mean,

259
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:16.760
could it be autonomous?
Could it,

260
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.940
could the user decide what kind of experience and then what you just going to be

261
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:20.900
the king of the Matrix.

262
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:24.530
You just going to be gangas con fucking all these women and cutting everybody's

263
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:29.040
heads off.
And never lose a war.
I mean is that,
what are we going to do,
Ellen?

264
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.920
<v 5>It's kind of talks about that like when you get total control of something it</v>

265
00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:37.921
becomes boring and so then you then you would want to naturally add in elements

266
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:42.220
of risk,
add in elements of uncertainty because then it becomes exciting again.

267
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.680
So actually probably the progression will be,

268
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:48.340
if you listen to that Allen Watson ception video,
the progression will be,

269
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.350
you know you go in and you do that.

270
00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:53.680
You get to be gang is con you have sex with 100,000 women,

271
00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:54.700
you rate all these places,

272
00:15:54.701 --> 00:15:57.730
you win everything and then all of a sudden you make it more difficult so you

273
00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:00.370
don't know if you're going to win and then to make it exciting,

274
00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:03.040
you don't know if you're going to get laid again and then all of a sudden you

275
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:05.440
reprogram it back and realize,
holy shit,

276
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:08.050
life was life was what I really wanted all along.

277
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.410
It has all the uncertainty and challenge that makes this thing really fun,

278
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.580
otherwise it's all fucking boring.
Or

279
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.250
<v 0>we find out that life itself is actually just a virtual reality and that we've</v>

280
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.280
all this time been living in this incredibly realistic simulation.

281
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.340
Cool.
I'll give the program or a high five because this shit's awesome.

282
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.020
Pretty good.
They did a good job.

283
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.910
That means they set up all the preposterous aspects that make you question it's

284
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.590
reality,
right?
Like,
um,

285
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.920
the Chris Christie thing we were talking about today was in the news that he's,

286
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.850
he spent some fucking ungodly amount of money.
The,
you know,

287
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:44.860
if you don't know who Chris Christie is,
he's the,

288
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.170
he's the governor of New Jersey and he's an enormously morbidly overweight

289
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:55.090
gentleman who wants to run for president and also wants to make sure that people

290
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:57.790
don't smoke marijuana because marijuana is bad for you,

291
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.390
unlike massively overeating,

292
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.040
which apparently is not that bad for you.
But,
uh,
this is,
uh,

293
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.880
this was the B.
It's this,
it seems like it's not real.
When you read this,

294
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.060
he spent $82,000 of tax payer money on food at NFL Games.

295
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.760
You know how much food costs it and it felt games.
Not much.

296
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.300
It's like $8 for a sausage.
How much she has to eat.

297
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.920
It's insane how much money he spent,
but this is all taxpayer money.

298
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:33.370
This is why it's so fucked up,
man.
God,

299
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.780
it's insane.
It's hard to believe.

300
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.520
<v 5>You know one thing that they will never get right in one of these experiences</v>

301
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:45.820
though is like the true mystical experience.
You know,

302
00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:50.190
in this virtual reality world,
going to sit,
drink iowasca

303
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.190
<v 0>virtually is not going to be the same as sitting down hearing the eco rose,</v>

304
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:58.830
the sound and the jungle and drinking that in reality,

305
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.860
like that dimension is so different than what I think could ever be program.

306
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.300
So at least I think we got that one.
We can hold out for me.
Well,

307
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:12.670
that was what Mckenna believed they were going to be able to,
they,

308
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.860
he believed that the DMT experience was going to be accessible to people,

309
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:18.390
to virtual reality.
First.

310
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.370
He said that most people are not going to be willing to take the leap of faith

311
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:28.371
that it takes to light the DMT and take it into your lungs and visit the spirit

312
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:29.430
realm.

313
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.030
And he really thought that the way they were going to create it was someone was

314
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:37.740
going to figure out how to make a virtual reality version of a DMT experience.

315
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.920
And that was what,
and he thought that if you did do that,

316
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.240
you would actually contact the real DMT realm and you actually,

317
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.600
they would be a way that they would enter through that gate.
Well,

318
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.370
obviously he did wait to me.
He went too far.
I kind of went too far,

319
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.840
was on brother.
I mean he was amazing.

320
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.800
He was an amazing bard and he had some incredible ideas because of that.

321
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:05.880
But that was one of the big ones.
You can duplicate the,
the visuals,

322
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:10.560
but the creativity and the specificity of what the messages that come across,

323
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.080
I mean it's not just random,
it doesn't work for everybody.

324
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.350
It's not like picking up a,
you know,
an astrology book where it,

325
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.010
it kind of work for most people or whatever.
You know,
it's,

326
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.040
this is specific information for you that comes out,
you know,

327
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:27.840
and I think that that true connection with whatever that other place in your

328
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:31.260
brain is or that other world,
you know,
the astro world,

329
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.130
whatever you want to call it,

330
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:37.131
your vocabulary permits that that true access allows this kind of really unique

331
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.550
message to come through that's just tailored for you.

332
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.110
And that's why it's so effective.
Yeah.

333
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.680
That is one of the weird and unique aspects of psychedelic experiences.

334
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:51.000
It's almost like what you need at that time finds you,

335
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.600
it's like you like almost like there's an assessment of your overall predicament

336
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.390
and go,
oh look this,
why these things keep going on Jim,

337
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.920
to show you guys,
show us what,

338
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.850
oh,
that's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Um,
Goddamn Tri caster,

339
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:17.220
shitty fucking machine.
Um,
but it seems like they,
it,

340
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.470
it finds whatever,

341
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.740
whatever hole you've got and then fills it in like,
oh,

342
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.660
you just shove this in that hole and now you're going to get a,

343
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.160
a sense of what's wrong and you're going to get a sort of a depiction or a

344
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:37.130
picture of what the errors on your operating system are.
Yup.

345
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.090
That finds it.

346
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.040
Is that what you think it makes psychedelic research so appealing?

347
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:48.220
Is that it's tailoring,
like dialing in a specific solution for each individual

348
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.430
<v 3>from a psyche psychiatric standpoint then?
Yeah,</v>

349
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.180
I think there are a couple of different opportunities that it presents,

350
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.110
which is bringing up to the surface that very thing that we're ready to receive

351
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:00.640
that we didn't realize it was right there.

352
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.810
And it also helps to rewrite the neurochemistry and reboot the neuroendocrine

353
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:08.320
system to let you actualize it and move it forward into your life.

354
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:09.931
So the,

355
00:21:09.931 --> 00:21:14.880
the psychedelics right now that the whole resurgence of psychedelic research is,

356
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:20.020
is showing how well they work for the very aspects that psychiatry is really

357
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:23.950
weak at.
Addiction recovery,

358
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.840
treatment resistant depression,
chronic severe PTSD,

359
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.180
end of life transition issues,

360
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.850
all the areas that psychiatry is really stuck at,
the psychedelics are,

361
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.390
are very good at and there's a wide breadth of the psychedelics that are

362
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:46.020
available and then we get really crafty and being able to,

363
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.270
to recognize because of what this person is going through,

364
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:52.960
what might be the best psychedelic to use for them in the right setting.

365
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.880
So in the right set and setting,

366
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:59.110
you get this opportunity to really actualize your best self to realize what you

367
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:03.250
weren't looking at and to face your shit to work through that and then to see

368
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:04.750
the path of becoming even better.

369
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.690
<v 4>That's a,
those are really good points.
The,
the,</v>

370
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.610
the drug addiction one is really good point.

371
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.190
The end of life transition as another really good point.

372
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:17.290
And Ptsd even,
you know,
traumatic stress,

373
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.250
I mean he could be as horrific as war or as seemingly simple but unbelievably

374
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:28.090
traumatic as a breakup.
You know,

375
00:22:28.091 --> 00:22:31.120
there's some people that go through breakups and they think their fucking life

376
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:35.710
is over.
They think it's over.
I mean they think like,
I can't go on like this.

377
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:38.980
Like this loss is too much for my soul to bear.

378
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.310
And then they do ecstasy and they go,
oh,
I'm going to be fine.

379
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.380
Thanks guys.
An asshole.
Why?

380
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.870
Why was it even living with him in the first place?
Oh,
she was ruining my life.

381
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.260
I didn't even realize she was running my life.
Oh my God,

382
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:56.680
I'm just like a bitch because a bitch clinging to this fucking ridiculous idea

383
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.430
that this woman is going to save me or this man is going to save me.
Yeah.

384
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.710
<v 3>We were talking just the other day about the,
the,</v>

385
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.930
the prevalence of suicide and young teenage girls in certain communities,

386
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.400
particularly in native cultures.
Um,

387
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.820
and there's studies that show that young adolescents,

388
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.440
both girls and boys,
but particularly with girls,

389
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.010
they have a significant resolution of anxiety that's related to how they view

390
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:29.140
themselves going through only one session of Iowasca.

391
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.060
Wow.
That's incredible,
man.
Wow.

392
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.230
So that's really a new bridge that we're talking about like rights of passage,

393
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.770
those ceremonies,
those experiences really helped people mature,

394
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.220
self actualize,
be able to recognize who they really and not have so

395
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.030
<v 4>much that's invested in and who they think they need to be in these</v>

396
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:52.700
relationships that when they fall away like,
like this,

397
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.730
this crazy thing that happens with a internet bullying online and it just really

398
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.800
shatters these young people self esteem and they ended up like checking out like

399
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:04.760
that's too much.

400
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:10.040
That just completely collapsed their worldview and there's no idea that they can

401
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:12.920
not imagine themselves going through that in a successful way.

402
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.630
So it's better to check out.
They also can't imagine that this bullying,

403
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.580
as horrible as it is,
if you get through it and and you,

404
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.240
you gain perspective,
it'll actually help you later in life.

405
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:30.770
Like you will now have tools to deal with shitty human beings that you may

406
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:34.490
perhaps run into and he counterintuitively,

407
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.550
you will greatly appreciate the kind people around you in a way that you might

408
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:44.050
not appreciate them.
It's like people in La don't appreciate the sun,

409
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.460
right pitches there every day.
Cause nagging.

410
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.150
You got to put on your sunglasses,
you know,

411
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:53.030
but go to Seattle or go to go to fucking Columbus,

412
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:57.020
Ohio in the winter where every day is cloudy gray,

413
00:24:57.021 --> 00:25:01.940
that gray sky winter thing,
the buffalo winter have been to buffalo,
New York.

414
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.730
I mean if it's the winter and you don't get any clouds,
you're like,

415
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:09.380
what is happening?
Look at the sky.
It's blue.
It's opposed to be blow.

416
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.800
But you just get used to that shit.

417
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.740
And when you do see the sun,

418
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.030
it's a magical creature that's come down to give you half

419
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.660
<v 6>been asked in the form of vitamin D and warm,
warm feels like love.
Yeah.</v>

420
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:27.020
The way it feels on your skin.
Yeah.
We're used to that.
Like,
oh my God,

421
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:29.720
it's so hot.
You know?
We're used to that here.

422
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.920
We've been so effective at taking away all of the really challenging things and

423
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:37.910
expecting not to have challenging things that I think it's going to take

424
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:41.230
intention to intentionally put those back through rituals,

425
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.320
through rites of passage,

426
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:46.550
through these terrifying scary or deals that you have to go through in order to

427
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:49.310
get used to that paradigm again.
You know,
I mean that's,

428
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.940
I think we're getting to the point now where we're so good at removing the

429
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:56.480
environmental ones.
We're going to have to go with intention to put them back.

430
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.750
And even back in scary times,
they had intentions to do that.

431
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:01.940
You go to some tribes who live in the jungle,

432
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.660
which is a hard ass place to live and they're still sticking their hands and

433
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.960
oven mitts of bullet ants are still fashioning bungee cords out of vines and

434
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:16.160
moldy ropes and stuff and jumping off towers,
you know,
to show that their show,

435
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:19.340
their fearlessness.
And even in our day we have everything easy.

436
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:23.030
So we have nothing environmental and we're not doing anything else intentional.

437
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.920
Yeah.
And this is definitely not to them to imply

438
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.060
<v 4>that pulling isn't in any way.
Good.
No,
you know,
it's awful.</v>

439
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.840
People that are mean.
I don't,
I,

440
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:35.330
I always wonder what that is when you see like kids that are shitty to other

441
00:26:35.331 --> 00:26:36.740
kids,
you know,

442
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:41.741
like you see that like the instinct that they have to be shitty or they see

443
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:46.830
weakness and they poke at it and I push it,
it's not good.

444
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.300
But even in bad things,
the,

445
00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:52.500
the counter to those bad things,

446
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.210
you can somehow or another get benefit from it and that benefit will make you

447
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:00.600
stronger.
And that's,
it's really fascinating.
Like what we were talking about,

448
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:03.900
the sauna or what we were talking about going through adversity in life,

449
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:05.070
like all of these things,
he seemed,

450
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.200
it seems to be almost a law that the universe has,

451
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.300
that the ebb and flow of things,
the push and the pull of things.
I mean,

452
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:16.530
I don't think it's a fucking,

453
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.400
I don't think it's a coincidence that these bad motherfuckers keep coming out of

454
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:25.020
Siberia,
you know?
I mean,
look at all these rue salon providing a cough,

455
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.420
you know,
um,
these,

456
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.160
these boxers that are coming out of the Soviet Union now and especially Siberia,

457
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.890
like they're fucking monsters.
You know?

458
00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.460
Kovalev these guys are monsters and they're coming out of Russia.

459
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.350
It's cold as shit,
Russia.

460
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.700
So you develop a different kind of human being because they're,
they,

461
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.630
they're surviving all the time and in surviving they're

462
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.473
<v 0>growing.</v>

463
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.890
One of the traditions they're in Siberia is to go swim in the river.

464
00:27:53.891 --> 00:27:56.380
And a lot of places they go swim in the river every morning.

465
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.030
Like in military cadet training.
Historically,
like the Siberian,

466
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.050
you know,

467
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:07.050
cadets would have to go in and jump in this freezing ass water every morning to

468
00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:08.650
help toughen him up.
I mean,

469
00:28:08.651 --> 00:28:12.010
they got that idea there and that's the healthy way to do it.

470
00:28:12.011 --> 00:28:16.850
Obviously bullying is this really insidious kind of see,
you know,

471
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.030
psychological attack.

472
00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:22.810
That's really hard to see and really hard to look at as a stress like that.

473
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.640
But yeah,
I mean,
building those things in your life,
it's going to make it,

474
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.350
it's going to be positive.
And that's what sports do for us.

475
00:28:29.351 --> 00:28:33.760
Like sports or really sports in the military are really the only way that we

476
00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:37.900
have access to these really readily here.
And I kind of think that for bullies,

477
00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:42.310
even the act of bullying is extremely damaging just to do it.

478
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.010
I mean it only makes sense that it is right,

479
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.450
but you are causing all these bad feelings for all these people that don't

480
00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:49.990
deserve it.

481
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:54.490
They didn't do anything to you and you're just finding a weakness or finding a

482
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:58.870
deficit in their strength and attacking it while you're doing it to yourself.

483
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.380
You know,
in the truth,
you know,
as,
as the platinum rule would say,

484
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.030
you're really doing it to you living a different life and that's really

485
00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:09.550
difficult for the higher self,
you know,
the,

486
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.510
the conscious self to deal with because you're hurting herself in a very real

487
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:15.760
way.
Yeah.
You don't appreciate yourself,
you know,

488
00:29:15.761 --> 00:29:18.910
you don't appreciate who you are because you don't respect it.
Cause you know,

489
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:23.350
you're kind of a bitch fucking with people that don't deserve it.
But you know,

490
00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:27.420
it's,
it's just,
it's weird.
It's a weird instinct that children have cause a,

491
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.630
having children in wa seeing it,
like seeing it on the playground,
like seeing,

492
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:35.290
watching little boys push other little boys for no reason when watching how it

493
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.470
goes down.
It's very bizarre behavior.
And I,
and I,
I'm,

494
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.140
I've been struggling with recently not struggling with it or analyzing it as a

495
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:48.460
better sense,
trying to figure out when I do see it,
like what is,
what's the,

496
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:51.130
is there an evolutionary advantage to any of this?

497
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:55.420
Is there a reason why this exists or is this just from the harsh days of old

498
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:58.630
where you're just trying to find the weak wolf and kick it the fuck out of the

499
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.680
clan?
Because if you don't,
you know,
the pack won't be strong.

500
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.160
You got to get rid of all the bitches.
Do you cower when I come near you?

501
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:08.860
Are you cowering you fucking fat?
Fuck Outta here.

502
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.670
He kicked him out of the Goddamn tribe and send them out into the woods to die

503
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:16.030
on their own.
You know?
And I think there's,
it's awful.

504
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.140
But I got to think that's why wolves do it.
You know?

505
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:25.030
And Wolves sense like some wolf that's gonna fall apart under pressure.

506
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:28.780
Like you fucking pussy.
They go,
we can't hunt Moose with you.

507
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.660
You know you're going to,
you're going to get tired.
You Bitch,

508
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.190
you don't get the fuck out of here.

509
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.410
And that's exactly why humans have had these rituals before.
You know,

510
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.400
these different rites of passage will they,

511
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.510
will this person buckle under pressure?
You know,

512
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.310
they fold when it comes to her and it's like that person you walk up to on a

513
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:48.850
water slide and you wait in line for a goddamn hour with them and then they get

514
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:52.000
to the top of the water slide.
I can't do it.
Let me down.
You're like,

515
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:53.020
you gotta be fucking kidding.

516
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:55.900
I waited an hour to go down this thing and I'm not even excited about it.

517
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.520
You know,
like that person,

518
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:00.820
you got to weed that out early because what if you're on a,
you know,

519
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.350
a life and death situation.

520
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:05.290
They needed to know that if Dunkin was here right now you're talking about me,

521
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:10.270
man.
Stop talking about me.
I'm right here.
Yeah,

522
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.710
I mean that's,
and that was,

523
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:14.470
that was the old way and I think that's what we got to bring back,

524
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:19.471
but we can't do it in these like anonymous Facebook,

525
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:21.340
bullying,
cyber,

526
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:26.341
it's too complicated a stress for the human brain to to handle because we're not

527
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.840
equipped evolutionarily to handle that kind of stress.

528
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.990
I think we should call each other to their,

529
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.620
to courage and call each other to face these different things,

530
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:39.820
but not in that way.
Not in a mean way.
Not in a way like come on,
let's,
let's go,

531
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:44.800
let's see what we can do together here.
Do it in a different way.
Yeah.

532
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.980
The other thing about the,
the idea of the cyber world,

533
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.720
the idea of virtual worlds is that the people that are playing,
you know,

534
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:56.290
fill in the blank halo or,
and these crazy games getting really good at it,

535
00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.680
they're not experiencing the character development that someone would have if

536
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:07.810
they got really good at,
you know,
whatever Jujitsu or you know,

537
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:12.400
fill in the blank,
may something incredibly difficult.
You know where you,

538
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.300
you see like when you meet someone who's really truly great at something,

539
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.560
anything where they put incredible amount of hard work and out of that hard work

540
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.070
has emerged is truly unique talent that something,

541
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.350
is that something fascinating to watch?

542
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.330
Like there's a quality to those people have that you don't get from cyber game

543
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:33.400
players and that's weird.

544
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:38.410
I wonder what that is because it's obviously difficult to get really good at

545
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.560
playing a video game.

546
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
It's obviously there's something rewarding about it because they love to do it.

547
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:47.660
They love to kick other people's asses and those video games.

548
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:53.050
But I don't necessarily think it translates into that character development in

549
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:56.300
the real world.
Like as in a personality sense.

550
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.840
And in fact there's like a lot,
I mean the,

551
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.020
when you talk about like people that are like cyber game players,

552
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.790
one of the big characterizations,
whether it's fair or not,

553
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.050
is that they're really awkward Dorks,
right?

554
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:15.980
Like that's the number one way you think of like someone who plays video games

555
00:33:15.981 --> 00:33:19.660
all day.
Oh Jesus Christ.
What's his guy like to hang out with when,
you know,

556
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.820
get them outside,
you know,
and that's,
you know,

557
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:26.250
you're seeing a different type of player now.
Like I know,
you know,

558
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.560
some people we've worked with,

559
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.010
they'll do yoga and they'll like try to focus on that.

560
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.600
So you're starting to see a different type of that.

561
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:35.360
But I do agree for sure with your initial point.

562
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:39.560
And I think that the idea is that,
you know,
real consciousness is,

563
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.850
it's home is in the body.

564
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.870
And when people think of like mind and consciousness and body as all separate,

565
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.810
really,
when you're truly conscious,
it's when everything is like sucked into,

566
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.810
into one entity.

567
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:55.070
It's a true presence of being where you're physically embodying your

568
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:58.460
consciousness and when you're just using your mind and your thumbs,

569
00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.930
it's almost like a,

570
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.680
you're separating yourself from a key element of consciousness,

571
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:04.970
which is embodied consciousness.

572
00:34:04.971 --> 00:34:09.340
So you're working on a level of mastery that's really very narrow,
you know,

573
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.970
it's a good point.
That's a really good point.
That must be what it is,
right?

574
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.840
Well what it must be is like you're neglecting your body because you're sitting

575
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:22.160
on a couch all day and your fucking back is hunched at the end of the day.

576
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.920
I mean,
how many video game players have fucking horrible backs.

577
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.300
It's gotta be a lot,
right?
If you're playing all day,
hunched over a computer,

578
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:33.650
you're going blind and your back is turned to shit going blind from the

579
00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:37.350
masturbation because that got to find that.
I do.
That's what I hear.
Yeah.

580
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.070
That's what Kellogg would tell us.
Did you ever deal with anybody,

581
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:42.460
I mean I know you worked with the people that have addiction.

582
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.700
Have you ever worked with people that have like non non chemical addictions or

583
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.270
non chemical in the traditional sense like like video game addictions or

584
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:51.380
gambling addictions?

585
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.810
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Yeah.</v>

586
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:56.660
I'm affiliated with the organization called crossroads and that's an Ibogaine

587
00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.150
treatment center and we're also building the first psychedelic research

588
00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:03.130
institute there.
Um,

589
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:08.190
when people go through Ibogaine it rewrites the neurochemistry reboots that

590
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:12.760
whole pathway and that pathway is set up for an addictive profile,

591
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.550
doesn't,
it?
Doesn't matter what the addiction is,

592
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:19.660
it's the same chemical pathway and it's that that addiction could be heroin,

593
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.370
methamphetamine,
cocaine,
it could be work,
sex,

594
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.200
video games,
whatever.

595
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:31.180
It's that same chemical pathway that's also associated with what chicks sent me

596
00:35:31.181 --> 00:35:35.950
high called flow states.
It's that dopamine,
neurochemical pathways.

597
00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:40.951
So when you channel focus that prime directive into a productive way that can

598
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.820
elucidate the flow state in that flow states essentially like your prime focus

599
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:52.050
on the current experience to the exclusion of everything else.

600
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.090
That's just like any kind of addiction that the mind can't rewrite,

601
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:58.560
it can't move away from.

602
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.430
So the definition of addiction is essentially like getting stuck in these

603
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:05.280
repetitive loops with something as the focus.

604
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.990
Even in the midst of detrimental experience,
you can't shift,

605
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.550
you can't break that cycle.
So it's doing something over and over and over,

606
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:18.900
even though you know that there's a bad consequence.
So his is an addiction

607
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.800
<v 4>essentially.</v>

608
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:24.801
Almost like a side effect of the process that's involved in us getting good at

609
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:26.664
something.

610
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.730
Because I've always found that in getting anything that I become obsessed with.

611
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.860
Anything that I really started wanting to get good at it,

612
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.820
it starts to permeate my life oftentimes in an uncomfortable way where it's

613
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:45.150
going on that like Eddie Bravo and I used to talk about this all the time with

614
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:50.151
Jujitsu that you would have like this underlying operating system that was

615
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:55.320
always doing Jujitsu that you,
you,
you would be,

616
00:36:55.321 --> 00:36:57.840
if you were in a conversation with somebody and they wanted to talk to you
about,

617
00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:00.210
well what the Democrats got to do is,
you know,

618
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.580
highlight the fact that we've created all these new jobs.

619
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.380
You just start thinking about choking people.

620
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.840
So I was just thinking like this is boring as fuck.

621
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.990
I'm going to concentrate on positions in my hand.
I'm going to nod my head.

622
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.340
But the,
the,
the Ma that what's going on behind the scenes,
the operating system,

623
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:14.530
what's,

624
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:19.530
what's always on his Jujitsu and almost everybody I know that is really good at

625
00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:20.880
Jujitsu.
Thanks like that.

626
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:25.830
They all talk about how Jujitsu becomes almost like,
like a,

627
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.110
like a metronome in the background,
but it's like constantly going on.

628
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:35.730
And one of the benefits of that is that what you have this positive,

629
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.710
um,
really healthy,
uh,

630
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.260
rewarding experience that you're obsessed with.
So you're addicted,

631
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.260
but you're addicted to something that's super beneficial.

632
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.390
<v 3>Hmm.
So that differential being that there's a positive outcome,</v>

633
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.220
right?
Versus a negative outcome.

634
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.580
So you could describe that positive outcome experience,

635
00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.810
even though it might be an addiction because the mind so focused on essentially

636
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:04.140
a flow state,
you just keep re accessing that flow state,

637
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.540
<v 4>just reactivating something that for whatever reason,</v>

638
00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:13.541
the way it is engaging with your life and your mind is negative.

639
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.980
Like gambling addicts.
Yeah.
Like people were gambling addicts,

640
00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:21.620
they just want that action all the time.
So,

641
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.410
<v 3>and that's one of the,
that's one of the hardest addictions,
gambling,
gambling,</v>

642
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:27.360
because it's an intermittent reward.

643
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.450
You don't know what the outcome's going to be.

644
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.730
<v 4>Oh.
So sometimes it's positive,
sometimes it's negative.</v>

645
00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:36.160
Look at it from the right perspective.

646
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.140
<v 3>It's all negative because of the net loss.</v>

647
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.200
And that's gamification to video games.
Same thing.

648
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.950
You don't yet know what the outcome's going to be.
So there's so much engagement,

649
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.860
heroin,
cocaine,
those kinds of substances,

650
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:49.660
you generally know what you're going to get.

651
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:55.240
So you can avoid those because you've experienced it,
you know what it is,

652
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:58.480
you know the negative repercussions of it.
You can step back.
Well,
it keeps,

653
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:03.020
it keeps people in [inaudible] right.
So the components of those addictions to,

654
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.060
right.
And that's why heroin so hard to kick and I began,

655
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:12.061
has like a 70% success rate and helping people kick heroin after one treatment.

656
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.730
That's pretty amazing.
That's pretty fucking amazing.

657
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.990
I know a good friend who has a with him was Oxycontin,

658
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:24.910
but essentially the same drug.
Right.
And uh,
he wanted to,
uh,
I went to Mexico,

659
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.980
took Ibogaine,
kicked it instantly,

660
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:31.790
and now he runs a treatment center down there for that very reason.
Yeah.
And,

661
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.110
and,
and the,
the long term predictor,
just to put that into context,

662
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.940
the longterm predictor is ongoing support.
So people have like recovery coaching.

663
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.190
Some people do 12 steps,
but the recovering coaching,

664
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:46.650
because I began itself as an addiction interrupter.
How does it,
what's the,

665
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.980
the actual physical mechanisms that are going on?
Well,

666
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:52.960
the psychedelic has wide variety,

667
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:57.460
but with Ibogaine particularly has an effect on the serotonin system,

668
00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:01.030
the dopamine system,
and the opiate system or the opioid system.

669
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.280
It's one of the most complex interactions.

670
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:06.340
Most of the psychedelics operate on the serotonin system solely.

671
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.840
This ibogaine game acts on multiple systems across multiple fronts.

672
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.150
And so one of the reasons is particularly good for heroin is because it has that

673
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.630
unique profile of working on the opiate system.

674
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.730
What it seems to do as it goes in and it scrubs the opiate neurons completely

675
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:28.480
clean of the residue.
So when you look at the data,

676
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.430
people go through no or very little of the withdrawal symptoms.

677
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.570
Wow.
Right?
And that's the,

678
00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:39.100
that's the biggest thing for people going through heroin on their own is to kick

679
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:43.630
it because they're just deathly afraid of the withdrawal that's going to come.

680
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.060
So they just keep getting stuck in the cycle.

681
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.120
So if you can offer them something held in the right set and setting,

682
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.300
that gives them the opportunity to rewrite it with very little discomfort.
Right.

683
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.330
<v 7>Very little discomfort.
You're full of shit there.
Dot your fullest.</v>

684
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.580
I just compressed,

685
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.800
they compress all of the horror of any kind of any kind of come down for that

686
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.360
few hours into your 40 hour,

687
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.760
two hours you guys need to come together and reach a consensus is few or is it

688
00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:18.400
40 cause I you Bolga is

689
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.670
<v 3>36 hours plus or minus.
For me it was 40 hours.
Both Times pretty intense.</v>

690
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:28.380
I have a gain is the primary alkaloid.
There's 12 or so primary.

691
00:41:28.381 --> 00:41:31.680
Eric lutes in Ebola,
which is the plant root itself.

692
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.890
I began as the extracted primary alkaloid that's used a safer therapeutic

693
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:43.430
window,
easier to dose,
easier to manage and it has a shorter half life.

694
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:45.170
So it's usually about 12 hours.

695
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.040
That's all just 12 hours where it feels like you're in a high voltage shed and

696
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:52.400
you're puking and you're spinning and there's a thousand pound pancake on you

697
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.380
and you're just being that this misery will end clean.

698
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:00.290
What do I have to do in my life that I never have to do a Bogo again?

699
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.480
But it's also you're examining like versus every aspect of,
so for,
for me,

700
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:08.060
going through your book,
I didn't have a,
I didn't have a drug addiction.

701
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.630
I was kicking,
I wanted to know the psycho spiritual implications.

702
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:16.080
And I also was trying it on because the clients that I kept,
um,

703
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.001
interfacing with,

704
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:20.100
I would do a lot of one on one work with clients and I knew the Boga or Ibogaine

705
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.220
was the right direction for them.

706
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.700
And they would ask me what's the experience like?
And as opposed to me saying,

707
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:29.420
well,
I've heard it's like x,
Y andZ ,
I need to actually go in the lab,

708
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:32.720
try it on for size so I can speak about it first person perspective.

709
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.590
So I did he boga twice.
And then when I came on board with crossroads,
um,

710
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.640
they work with Ibogaine and same kind of thing I needed to experience what it

711
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:45.440
was like for me actually I began,
was more intense than he bogan for most people.

712
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:48.740
It's the other way around.
Um,
but suffice it to say,

713
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:50.870
when you know that you're,

714
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.190
you're most people going through heroin or some kind of really bad addiction,

715
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.520
there are at a crossroads.
And so hence the name of the center.

716
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.860
They were at a crossroads where they have hit rock bottom and they know they're

717
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:09.340
at that level of desperation that if they don't make a significant shift than

718
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.080
some,
something really bad's going to happen.
Like they're going to die.

719
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.240
They're going to completely annihilate their entire family system,
whatever.

720
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.250
So they're coming with some motivation.
So when you,
when you let them know that,

721
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:24.320
yeah,
the experience can be potentially difficult.

722
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:29.321
And at crossroads it's the safest Ibogaine experience that you can have anywhere

723
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:33.350
because it's in a hospital clinical environments,
right?
Nick?
It's in Tijuana,

724
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:36.770
right next to Angeles hospital.
There's doctors on call right next door.

725
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:40.220
There's nurses on staff in the room.
You're wearing a holter monitor,

726
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.970
24 hour EKG monitor because people do die with Ebola and Ibogaine.

727
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.270
And usually it's because,
um,
they,

728
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.270
they weren't truthful and that they were using something long acting like

729
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:55.340
suboxone or methadone when they came in.

730
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.600
And you cannot be on a long acting opiate.
When you take your Boga bad news,

731
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.330
you can be on a short acting and then when that washes out,

732
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:07.250
you start the Ebola or Ibogaine.
And if everything's clean on board,

733
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:08.480
like they're not taking other drugs.

734
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:10.910
And I didn't only in their second month psychiatric medications,

735
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.690
the only other problem that people typically run into,
which isn't very common,

736
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:16.040
but it has happened,

737
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:21.490
maybe 1% of the time people will have an arrhythmia or a hot heart beat

738
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:26.450
irregularity because it drops your blood pressure and it drops your heart rate.

739
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.500
And if you're not wearing a monitor and you're not really paying attention,

740
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.570
what happens,
um,
then you can get in some trouble there.
So when,

741
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.850
if you have a crash cart on site,
it's fairly clinical setting,

742
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:39.390
then all those bases are covered.
So such in that set and setting,

743
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.310
it gets extraordinarily safe and you offer the people opportunity come through.

744
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.290
So when you're looking at it like from the uh,

745
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:50.190
Western addiction medicine perspective,
what are the numbers people go in?

746
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.330
What are the numbers of success rate?
People come in through an average,
um,

747
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.710
rehabilitation setting like up in Malibu.
Those numbers,

748
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:02.130
like maybe 15% plus or minus depending on the setting,

749
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:06.990
15% versus 60,
65 70% depending on the setting.

750
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:10.290
With the vulgar I began,
that's a 400 fold increase.

751
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.000
<v 4>The difference being many factors,</v>

752
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.740
the difference being that there's actually some physiological changes of this

753
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:19.970
drug is doing to your body.

754
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:25.150
And then also one inescapable fact of it is that the psychedelic experience is

755
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:30.431
pretty much all of them have that insane transcendent moment where you are

756
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.320
whatever the world that you were living in before you took that drug,

757
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.860
you were kind of basing your own experiences.
Like,
here's the range.

758
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.870
Here's the spectrum of experiences in life from my dog died too.
I got laid,

759
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:48.890
you know,
uh,
the birth of my child.
This is the,
this is the wonderful,

760
00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:49.790
this is the awful.

761
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:55.030
And then you part the doors to the psychedelic experience and it's just like you

762
00:45:56.241 --> 00:46:00.440
stepped outside like you thought the roof was the ceiling of the universe.

763
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:03.230
You stepped outside and realized,
Oh my God,
it's infinite.
You know?

764
00:46:03.231 --> 00:46:04.080
It's like whoa.

765
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.840
So like the perspective change because they experienced is so intense and so

766
00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:13.490
broad and so literally all encompassing.
So he got until two things going on.

767
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:14.850
You've got the,

768
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:19.640
the physiological change that something like I began can do and then you've got

769
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:23.900
the actual experience itself which is so transcendent and none of those things

770
00:46:23.901 --> 00:46:27.980
are available in Malibu.
You go to,
I'm saying Malibu but you know any,

771
00:46:27.981 --> 00:46:30.910
any of these I want to,
I was watching,
you know,

772
00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:33.770
a periscope is this new thing that the kids or do wacky kids,

773
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.050
I was watching one yesterday,

774
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.730
I was just checking out different people's feeds and it was one from a rehabs

775
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:45.170
place like a house where these guys are all living together and rehabilitation

776
00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:48.980
and I'm like this is like a weird social support system that they're trying to,

777
00:46:48.981 --> 00:46:52.550
and they were talking about how great it is to not be drinking and you know,

778
00:46:52.551 --> 00:46:57.551
I'm getting my life in order and I'm like this is like a very small shift that

779
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:01.940
they're doing.
They're trying to cling onto this small shift and hang on and

780
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:04.840
blow fire,

781
00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.990
blow smoke on the blow air on the fire to try to get those embers to become a

782
00:47:08.991 --> 00:47:13.850
flame or you jump into lava.
That's the other option.

783
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.450
Yeah,
right.
The thing about it Boga all these psychedelic experiences,

784
00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:21.560
and I've done many of a variety of different durations from very short couple

785
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.290
minutes to very long like,

786
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:27.280
like a Boga and particularly with the plant medicines.
It's,

787
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.130
this seems to know how long it has.
Like

788
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.210
<v 5>the half life for the medicine seems to be something that's already calculated</v>

789
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:39.070
in your brain and so you get messages depending on how long you have,
you know,

790
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.100
a lot of times it's like a remarkable fact that I've noticed.

791
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.610
But with a Boga you have so much time that a boga just really takes its time and

792
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:53.140
relentlessly showing you all of the steps that you took to lead you to different

793
00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:55.690
situations that you're not happy with.
I mean,

794
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.020
I remember when I did it the last time,
it took me,

795
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:04.021
like I spent about five hours showing me the hypothetical possible scenarios

796
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:07.660
that I could go with my life that wouldn't be beneficial,

797
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:11.230
that would be harmful to the world.
And it was like five hours of that.

798
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:13.970
Whereas like with Iowasca you'll get maybe,
you know,

799
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:17.530
half an hour that and then we'll be like,
okay,
but that's not reality.
This is it.

800
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.300
Like a Bogo has so much time that it just really beats these things to death.

801
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.510
So you won't even think about going down that road again.

802
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:28.810
Or if it's something and something that's in Congress,
in your life,

803
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:32.430
like a relationship,
you know,
you can wrestle with it.
I wrestled,
you know,

804
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.620
in another a Bogue experience.

805
00:48:33.621 --> 00:48:37.780
I wrestled with a relationship I had for like eight hours.

806
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:40.540
And I'd say maybe this way it'd be like,
nope,
not this way because of this.

807
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:44.200
And it would show me the reasons why my logic was flawed and I ah,

808
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.230
and then I just come back again,
try another way.
And he's like,
nope,

809
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:49.720
not that way because of this.
You see you forgot 0.8 blah blah blah,

810
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.790
and it's just such a stern taskmaster when it comes to that and it has seemingly

811
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:58.690
infinite amount of time to just go through all of your rationalizations,

812
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:01.830
all your justifications.
You'd be like bullshit,
bullshit,
bullshit,
bullshit.

813
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.000
Showing it to you in a visual sense at vogue is a funny one because it's not as

814
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:10.990
visual as the other ones.
Like the DMT experiences particularly visual.

815
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.000
It Boga tends to be more thought based and when a vision needs to,

816
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:19.510
at least for me,
when a vision needed to have a visual explanation,

817
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.240
like it needed a visual cue,
it would come.

818
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:25.510
But a lot of times it's just directly thought based.

819
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:29.500
Almost like I was talking to a much smarter version of myself,

820
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.730
you know,

821
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:34.690
it was a really interesting way that interact because the visions were pretty

822
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:35.524
mild.

823
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.100
<v 3>I would think the Boga in a sensory deprivation tank would be the ultimate,</v>

824
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.740
well that might be,
that might be oh one to work up to.

825
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.400
And prior to that,
because like oftentimes if would ask me the question like,

826
00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.710
okay,
I'm ready to have an experience,
where do I start?

827
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.630
So step number one is float and just float by yourself because a lot of people

828
00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:59.720
haven't even floated yet and really looked at their stuff because interestingly

829
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:03.770
enough,
it starts to promote our own DMT like experience.

830
00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:06.950
We see what's in the default mode network now comes online,

831
00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:10.430
we're able to look at more introspective analysis and see what was just behind

832
00:50:10.431 --> 00:50:13.760
the curtain that we didn't notice was there.
And now that comes onto the stage,

833
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:17.390
we can wrestle with that.
We can be with that and see what comes up,

834
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.460
make sure that we're okay with the unknown,

835
00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:22.010
that kind of sense of dissolving back into the void.

836
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:26.780
And then you can start stacking therapies like doing something in the,

837
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.840
and so you're like,
you're more entry level.

838
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:34.841
Psychedelics would be like Mtma DMT or weed marijuana.

839
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.010
Um,
as as the next kind of entry point.

840
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:42.590
And then beyond that then you get into and silicide.

841
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:45.980
But I would put in that entry level point and then beyond that you get into the

842
00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:50.981
second level and that's more like the pot what Chuma San Pedro Iowasca you boga.

843
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.300
And so it's,
it's nice to be able to know where people can start,

844
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:57.650
how to progress them through.

845
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.860
That's a lot of the psychedelic research is happening now is the,

846
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:04.550
is the correct screening to know who the experience is good for,

847
00:51:04.551 --> 00:51:07.820
who it's not good for people with a history of psychosis and mania,

848
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.690
not good for people currently on psychiatric medications.

849
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.640
Not good for because most of the medicines in psychiatric medications don't work

850
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:20.570
well together and there was an energetic clash and you can have a real bad trip

851
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.840
where you could have physiologically dangerous things happen.

852
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.440
So when we know we know we've got this whole arsenal to work with and then it

853
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:33.320
becomes alchemy.
Knowing which medicine to use,
at which person,

854
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.010
at which time and in which sequence,
which order,
like what's your,

855
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.630
what are your targets,
symptoms.

856
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:42.510
If your targets symptoms are anxiety associated with um,

857
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.810
chronic pain,
well great.

858
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:48.470
Then it might be something like yoga is helpful because the book is really

859
00:51:48.471 --> 00:51:53.180
helpful for pain because it's associated with that opiate um,
pathway.

860
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.480
And also let's prep with flotation and let's integrate with flotation because

861
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:02.720
flotation itself is also very good for pain.
Just flood,

862
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.250
just flotation by itself.

863
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.730
You start stacking therapies and I've seen clients and I've had clients that

864
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:08.564
have,

865
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.870
that have done a series of seven to 10 floats and all of a sudden now they're

866
00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:16.871
off all their opiates before with with resolution of their underlying symptoms,

867
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.580
whether it's PTSD,
anxiety,
insomnia,

868
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.430
and then they do maintenance floats after that.

869
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.040
So two to three a week for like three or four weeks.

870
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.250
And then you do booster floats like one a month.

871
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.650
And some of the psychedelics are kind of similar.

872
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:32.180
When you go through a big experience,

873
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:35.780
you have a long period of integration and then maybe you do a booster shot.

874
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.670
Now the whole psychedelic experience here in the states is,

875
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:43.010
is under um,
uh,
renaissance.

876
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:46.380
There's a lot of energy moving.
There's a lot of,
um,

877
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.870
clinical trials coming up in really reputable centers like the Hopkins study

878
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:51.770
with Psilocybin,

879
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:57.020
massive that really puts silicide been back on the map,
um,

880
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:57.711
in the,

881
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:02.711
in the scientific community because of the study was so well designed and the

882
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:06.500
outcomes were so amazing that you couldn't refute it.

883
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:11.810
94% of people who were psychedelically naive had one of the top five spiritual

884
00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:15.080
experience that I ever had and those,

885
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:20.030
and that experience lasted 14 months out with no side effects.
You're like,

886
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.420
holy cow,
that's pretty amazing.
MTMA assisted psychotherapy,

887
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:28.930
83% success rate for curing chronic severe PTSD after only two to three sessions

888
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.310
of MGMA supported psychotherapy.

889
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:36.210
So it's not just taking a drug and having your trip and all of a sudden now you

890
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:37.890
come out the other side resolved.
No,

891
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:41.550
it's like actually working with the trauma trained therapist and a really

892
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:46.551
supportive safe environment to work through that because Mgma is so good at the

893
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:52.320
d armoring that happens when people are traumatized and,

894
00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:57.420
and the data is just so Ebola with addictions and um,

895
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.420
silicide been even with addictions.
There was,

896
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.730
there's just a recent pilot study that came out,

897
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.760
80% of people with chronic addiction to tobacco resolved after one time use of

898
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:12.760
psilocybin.
Right.
And so what's,

899
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:16.500
what's like the next second best thing that the allopathic medical community has

900
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:21.330
for that?
What's like Nicorette gum at like 80 at like 8% success rates.

901
00:54:21.331 --> 00:54:24.450
You just went from 8% to 80% and oh by the way,

902
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:28.200
you just had a transformative mystical experience.
Yeah,

903
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.310
that was the side effects.

904
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:34.770
<v 4>Talk to spirit guides.
It's awesome.
Awesome Shit.
You'll never forget that.</v>

905
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:39.510
You'll tell people every time you see you talked to God CEO.

906
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:44.250
Exactly.
That's how I just don't understand how it's we,

907
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.110
we are here in this day and age with the thousands of years of people who've

908
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:51.400
been writing books and all that.
It's,

909
00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:55.980
it's just amazing to me that they've been able to suppress some of the most

910
00:54:55.981 --> 00:54:59.250
beautiful aspects of being a human being for so long.

911
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.420
And it seems like during our lifetime all this stuff is emerging.

912
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:07.680
Like some sort of a strange flower that refuse to be stuffed under the dirt.

913
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.280
It just,
the pop,
you know,
the,

914
00:55:10.281 --> 00:55:12.720
the buds are just popping through the surface of the ground,

915
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.400
no matter how much pressure was put on it,
dropping,
you know,

916
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:21.470
rocks on it and stacking up shit and trying to hold it down with lies and

917
00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:27.261
nonsense and pharmaceutical drugs and the lobbyists and all the pressure that

918
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:29.610
they put to keep this stuff down.

919
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.960
And then Johns Hopkins study comes out and it's like,

920
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:35.490
well you can't really refute.

921
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.850
I mean these are like some of the best minds in the world when it comes to these

922
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:39.684
subjects.

923
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.110
And then all the work that maps has done and that this has been amazing.

924
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.270
And the Internet itself,
the Internet itself,
I mean,

925
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:49.620
just the overwhelming amount of positive experiences,

926
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.020
anecdotal as they may be that people describe online,
it's,

927
00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:55.680
it gives people this,

928
00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:00.870
this community to draw from that doesn't exist in schools.

929
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:05.130
It doesn't exist in,
in most people's neighborhoods.

930
00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:09.810
It doesn't exist where the,
where you would normally do find information.

931
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:12.990
You know,
look,
if you,
if you want to figure out how to fucking frame a house,

932
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:13.620
there's,

933
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.100
there's a hundred guys probably in your city that can show you how to do it.

934
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:22.430
And if you want to figure out how to contact a spirit guide and remove yourself

935
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:27.970
from an addiction that you have to pornography or to gambling,
or no,
good luck,

936
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.200
good luck.
You're just gonna,

937
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.610
you're gonna talk to some fucking guy who runs a church and maybe does good work

938
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:37.420
and he wants 10% of your money and wants you to sing and talk about Jesus and

939
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.850
<v 5>it's not going to work.
Or you'll end up with the amethyst wand in your ass.</v>

940
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.460
That could happen too.
Not knowing what's going on in the other way.

941
00:56:43.461 --> 00:56:46.930
There's lots of people who will take advantage of that.
Of course.
And yeah,

942
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.640
this is,
this is,
uh,

943
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.300
certainly I think they've started something in motion that now can't be stopped.

944
00:56:53.301 --> 00:56:56.300
What I think we're going to have to be careful of is,
you know,

945
00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:00.690
with everything there's a certain point where medicine becomes poisoned and that

946
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.110
that happens with every single psychedelic,
you know,

947
00:57:03.111 --> 00:57:06.380
where it crosses the threshold where it's no longer beneficial and it's

948
00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:10.550
dangerous or the setting is wrong or the conflict is wrong and what's going to

949
00:57:10.551 --> 00:57:13.990
happen and what we need to be careful of is that there,

950
00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:17.540
there will be these bad incidents that come out just inevitably,
you know,

951
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:20.170
you hear about some of them from these,
you know,

952
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:24.230
pretty shady centers down in South America where people dive during Iowasca.

953
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:29.420
When that happens in,
you know,
on us soil,
which inevitably it will,

954
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.710
you know,

955
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.370
there's going to be this backlash and they're going to make one final push to

956
00:57:34.371 --> 00:57:38.650
try and,
you know,
to try and stomp this out and we just have to,
you know,

957
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.400
really adhere to truth and,

958
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.450
and stay calm and try and put out as much good science as possible because

959
00:57:44.451 --> 00:57:46.430
that's going to be the last card that they can play.

960
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.020
The numbers are just too high.

961
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.600
<v 4>Yeah.
The problem with those,
those,
the numbers of negative,</v>

962
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:53.300
the negative scenarios that they're depicting,

963
00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:58.160
just the numbers of positive are so overwhelming.
There's no,

964
00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:02.360
nothing is perfect.
Not,
not a single thing that you do.
You know,

965
00:58:02.361 --> 00:58:06.650
there's people out there that they can't eat fish and you know,
they,

966
00:58:06.651 --> 00:58:09.800
they try to have shell shellfish,
the,
their throat closes up.

967
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.350
It doesn't make sense,
but it just works that way.

968
00:58:12.351 --> 00:58:15.010
It doesn't mean we should pull all the shrimp from all the markets.
Right.

969
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:15.890
It's just there's,

970
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.250
there's going to be negatives because we just have so much biodiversity.

971
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.540
There's so much difference.

972
00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:23.780
If all the aspects that you were talking about that could be problematic.

973
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.460
People with psychosis,

974
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.700
history of mental health issues and drugs that they've been taking for these

975
00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.520
mental health issues for long periods of times that have done all sorts of

976
00:58:34.521 --> 00:58:36.410
really weird things.
Their brain chemistry,

977
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:41.030
that takes a long time to normalize from those numbers.
I mean,

978
00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:43.010
as long as we're rational and honest about it,

979
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.040
the overwhelmingly positive aspects of these therapies are undeniable.

980
00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.240
They're just too,
they're just too good.

981
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:50.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

982
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.180
Then the consumer driven movement has pushed it into the limelight and you've

983
00:58:54.181 --> 00:58:57.750
had people that kept the torch like Rick Doblin with maps.
Yes.

984
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:03.030
And the next evolution of that now with a few really different key organizations

985
00:59:03.031 --> 00:59:08.031
is to come up with a standard of a guideline for best practices.

986
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:12.390
And that's not to say that everybody has to adhere,
you know,

987
00:59:12.391 --> 00:59:13.860
rock solid to these practices.

988
00:59:13.861 --> 00:59:16.180
But generally what are the guidelines for practices?

989
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.430
You should be screening clients for these issues and if anybody has these
issues,

990
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:22.130
then they shouldn't into the experience.

991
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:26.390
This should be the general setting of the the right environment.

992
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.050
And this should be the ethical,

993
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.910
altruistic intention that people are coming to that experience in facilitation

994
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:35.744
that have,

995
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.190
that they're not doing it for profit and they're not doing it as some charlatan.

996
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:43.700
That they have a background,
they have a pedigree.
So,
you know,

997
00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.960
it's like the [inaudible] check.
What's their energy?
What's their experience?

998
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:51.410
This is in the facilitation role.
What's their energy?
What's your experience?

999
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:55.040
And do they have the ability to work as a spiritual EMT?

1000
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:59.390
Like if the shit goes down,
do they know how to pull the rip cord?

1001
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:01.340
If somebody's going through the midst,

1002
01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.630
in the midst of some really bad experience,
do they know how to talk them down?

1003
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.860
Bring the medicine down,

1004
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.170
intervene in a way so that the experience doesn't itself become traumatizing.

1005
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.360
<v 4>What about food addictions?
You know,</v>

1006
01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:19.080
it's interesting cause you were talking about the most difficult addiction to

1007
01:00:19.081 --> 01:00:23.310
quit being gambling.
Well that's as far as behavioral addiction,

1008
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:24.403
but as far as

1009
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.180
<v 3>neurochemical addictions itself,
um,</v>

1010
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.490
sugar is up there with heroin.

1011
01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:33.320
And some studies show that sugar is even harder to kick than heroin.
And it's,

1012
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.930
that's also a little challenging.
It's kind of like an addiction to technology.

1013
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.500
Um,
food addictions are tricky because it's not like you're going to stop eating

1014
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.440
right?
That's what I was going to bring up.
Right?
So there's a debate in,

1015
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.390
in a variety of,
um,
addiction circles around moderation,

1016
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.710
even with alcohol.
Um,
there's a movement in moderation where like,
you know,

1017
01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:57.300
the sponsor where the person helping coach of somebody going through sobriety,

1018
01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.630
we'll go to the bar and they'll have one drink and they'll talk about what it's

1019
01:01:00.631 --> 01:01:03.480
like to have one drink and then they'll leave together after only having like

1020
01:01:03.481 --> 01:01:07.890
one or two drinks without really reaching that point of significant detriment

1021
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.340
and be able to process that whole experience so that you're not,

1022
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.560
you're not trying to make this polarity statement like you went from this,

1023
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:19.230
you know,
crazy addiction to now you can have anything.

1024
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.650
And so if you're defining success as,

1025
01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.280
as being completely abstinent within,

1026
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.820
maybe you're actually not appreciating the benefit of successive steps along the

1027
01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:30.541
way.
Like,

1028
01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:33.870
if somebody has a heroin addiction and they're not taking care of their family

1029
01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:37.490
and they can't hold a job and they go through some kind of recovery program,

1030
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:42.240
or now they're using something else as maybe you had a transition addiction,

1031
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:45.960
but they're holding a job now they're better with their family and wife and
kids.

1032
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:50.640
There's very significant milestones and markers to where they have the,

1033
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:53.510
they have improved their life.
In my experience,
that's,

1034
01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:58.580
that's success because you're moving towards ongoing improved benefit.

1035
01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:03.050
<v 4>I had Dr. Andrew Hill on the podcast,
uh,
who,
uh,
has a,</v>

1036
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:05.850
a similar sort of a treatment approach.

1037
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.100
And one of the things that he does is they'll,

1038
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:13.130
they will go to a bar or the patient and have the patient have a drink and talk

1039
01:02:13.391 --> 01:02:17.340
them through it and make sure that they are only having one drink and that they

1040
01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:20.040
don't,
you know,
she's completely,
the goal should be

1041
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.540
<v 6>normalcy.
Not this like shaky damn.
Than if it leaks.
Right.</v>

1042
01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.440
Thing floods,
you know,
one day at a time.
Yeah.
And everything just breaks,

1043
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:29.580
you know,
you want to be,

1044
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.860
you want to get to the point where you're so not addicted.

1045
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:32.850
You're like everybody else.

1046
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:36.960
If someone cracks a really nice bottle of wine at dinner,
you can say,
yeah,
sure,

1047
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:40.170
you know,
if you want to not like,
ah Nah,
if I have that wine,

1048
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:43.800
I'll be into the minibar and then it'll be like that fucking Denzel Washington

1049
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:44.130
movie.

1050
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:48.870
But isn't there a physical aspects to addiction that have to be addressed with

1051
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.180
some people?
Totally.

1052
01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:54.720
Like some people really maybe should avoid alcohol almost entirely.

1053
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:59.020
<v 3>We will have a genetic predisposition towards hypersensitivity of the effects of</v>

1054
01:02:59.021 --> 01:03:03.010
alcohol.
And you see that with Asian populations,
particularly Asian women.

1055
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.270
You see that in the native American culture and population.
Um,
they have,
uh,

1056
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:08.463
they have,
uh,

1057
01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:13.810
a weakness in a particular enzyme that breaks alcohol down alcohol dehydrogenase

1058
01:03:14.681 --> 01:03:17.080
and it actually turns alcohol into acid Aldehyde.

1059
01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:19.660
And it becomes this like really toxic substance.
And you,

1060
01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.890
you have long stream detriments and ramifications and neurochemical,

1061
01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.840
um,
complexity.

1062
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:30.760
So you have a physiologic predisposition towards alcohol being really bad for

1063
01:03:30.761 --> 01:03:34.120
you.
And then you have the addiction.
Neurochemistry itself,

1064
01:03:34.121 --> 01:03:35.440
like we were talking about before.

1065
01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:38.980
And then you have everything underneath that which is the psychoemotional

1066
01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:42.990
psychospiritual implications.
Like what is empty from that person's life,

1067
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:47.050
that that keeps them addicted to a substance that they're trying to fill a void

1068
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.670
or numb a pain.

1069
01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.540
There's always these interplay of factors in it's important to look at all of

1070
01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:57.060
them.
And so whether it's alcohol or we were talking before about sugar,

1071
01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:01.420
sugar is one of the most addictive substances and it's,

1072
01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:04.450
it's really difficult to get completely away from,

1073
01:04:04.451 --> 01:04:08.770
you have to be really mindful about all the sugars that are added in fruit
juice.

1074
01:04:08.771 --> 01:04:12.280
Fruit juice seems healthy.
Yet when you look at the sugar load,
it's massive.

1075
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.120
And my experience going with Ibogaine is that I didn't appreciate that I had

1076
01:04:19.751 --> 01:04:24.400
this long standing sugar addiction and in and looking back,

1077
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.510
um,
I've had that for a long time.
And even looking back further,

1078
01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.050
I know now where it came from cause I,

1079
01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:32.960
I just kind of like did this retrospective analysis.
Um,

1080
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.010
I was in and out of the hospital for the first two years cause I had recurrent

1081
01:04:36.011 --> 01:04:36.431
pneumonia.

1082
01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:40.210
I was six weeks early and in recurrent pneumonia they put you on a lot of

1083
01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:42.760
steroids in the,
put you on a lot of antibiotics in a completely script,

1084
01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:47.761
screws up your gut flora and it predisposes you to Candido long time down the

1085
01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:53.050
road and Candida feeds on sugar.
So after you know,
I was,

1086
01:04:53.051 --> 01:04:56.650
I was addicted to alcohol for a while and kick that and then I became addicted

1087
01:04:56.651 --> 01:05:01.651
to pot for a while and then I kicked that and then I became addicted to work and

1088
01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:06.370
kind of more monastic practices,
meditation,

1089
01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.390
those sorts of things.

1090
01:05:07.391 --> 01:05:09.970
And I lived in the jungle and he's kind of like extreme experiences,

1091
01:05:09.971 --> 01:05:13.900
but sugar was always in the background.
And then when I went through,
I began,

1092
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:17.980
I came out and I have like zero on sugar now,

1093
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:22.780
zero because you recognize what it really is because it shifted the

1094
01:05:22.781 --> 01:05:23.614
neurochemistry.

1095
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:28.630
So without even knowing going in that there was this addiction there,

1096
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.350
because I would just wasn't registering it consciously.

1097
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:34.540
Did sugar addiction for somebody with,

1098
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.960
with a week metabolic load or maybe they're susceptible,

1099
01:05:37.961 --> 01:05:41.260
they have adrenal fatigue or they're susceptible to hold on to weight.

1100
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.310
Maybe a sugar addiction is a really bad thing because now you can see that

1101
01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:48.610
they've got this metabolic syndrome and they're moving into type two diabetes or

1102
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.850
whatever it might be.
Um,
for me it was always kind of in the background,

1103
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:55.240
but it was always there.
Like,
I have a sweet tooth that's insatiable.

1104
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:59.290
If I kick it off,
I go rampant.
Right?

1105
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.060
And so on the other side of Ibogaine,
there's no charge on sugar now.

1106
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:07.090
And I didn't even know that was going to come out the other side.

1107
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.440
I just ended up,
um,
everybody was feasting on sugar at this party.

1108
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:14.980
I was at like a few days later and,
and I had this kind of like,
um,
I was just,

1109
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.620
I just kind of looked at it and glanced away and I thought,

1110
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.330
well that's different.

1111
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:25.560
I remember that there would be this charge before and,

1112
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:29.290
and now there's nothing.
And so there isn't there.

1113
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:33.190
There's a whole thing that happens with addictive neurochemistry that might not

1114
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:37.720
necessarily be,
and that's all physiologic,
right?
I mean,
ultimately at the,

1115
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.100
at the end of the day,
we're all energy.
We're like 99.997% energy.

1116
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:43.780
This is just space.
So we're like,

1117
01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:46.570
you should have like these energetic beings and these all these implications

1118
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:50.320
around that depending on your spiritual and philosophical beliefs about what

1119
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:54.790
causes that to be the case.
We're also in this three d reality.

1120
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:58.300
We have these monkey suits that were wearing and sometimes a cigar is just a

1121
01:06:58.301 --> 01:07:02.620
cigar.
So if you have a candy to overgrowth,
it feeds on sugar.

1122
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.220
It's good to get rid of that in order to release the sugar.

1123
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:09.280
And you have to do that mindfully too,
because candy to buffers heavy metals,

1124
01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:13.000
we were talking about heavy metals before,
so when people go on these crash,

1125
01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:13.990
no sugar diets,

1126
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:18.991
oftentimes the candy to die off and it releases this massive toxic load on the

1127
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:22.240
system and that's why people feel shitty.

1128
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.850
It's not necessarily because of Candide is going away.

1129
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:27.070
It's because of all the things that the candy to released.

1130
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.990
So you have to be mindful about how do you,

1131
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:33.130
how you detox and stop waste fashions.
And it can get a little bit complicated,

1132
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:37.360
but we can do it well.
So that's just a long way to say for me personally,

1133
01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:40.720
and I've seen this with other clients to say that same thing,

1134
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:43.360
but until I had the experience myself,

1135
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:47.680
I really wasn't putting it in first person perspective and really appreciated

1136
01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:50.050
the fact that just by itself,

1137
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.730
you can see this too with people coming off of the streets on heroin just by

1138
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:58.420
itself.
There's a neurochemical,
addictive rewrite,

1139
01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:01.510
a reboot in that system that helps people.

1140
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.190
That's why it's an addiction interrupter.

1141
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.720
There's a really good documentary called,
um,
I begin rites of passage,

1142
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.890
I think it was been maybe eight years ago or so,
and it's really well done.

1143
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.320
Kind of like neurons to Nirvana,
which was more recent.
Also,

1144
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:16.040
another really good one,
um,

1145
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.870
that talks about that addictive neurochemical rewrite.
Flotation does that too.

1146
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:24.710
It's just not as big and you have to do a lot of floats.

1147
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.850
So when that neurochemical rewrite is,

1148
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:31.040
is happening and that interruption occurs,

1149
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:35.900
then you do the ongoing supportive work.
And so like addiction recovery coaching,

1150
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:39.080
like,
okay,
what was underneath that?
And through the experience,

1151
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.790
through this mystical experience,

1152
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:43.880
now you're reframing so much of the childhood trauma,

1153
01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:49.490
the trauma and addiction are extraordinarily interwoven trauma,

1154
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:53.000
Adhd and addiction are extraordinarily interwoven.

1155
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.370
So when we understand the,
the neurological implications,
the trauma implications,

1156
01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:01.550
the transgenerational implications,
right?

1157
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.040
So if people have problems with their genetics,

1158
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.960
there's a whole now burgeoning field called nutrogenomix or detoxing genomics

1159
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.820
where you do these genetic profiles and it shows you what you were ability to

1160
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:16.640
detox certain things.
Ours,
and when we were talking about heavy metals,

1161
01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:18.560
like we're too heavy metals come from,
well,

1162
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:23.180
it's like kind of like when people are exposed to the flu.
The flu is everywhere.

1163
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:28.240
But some people express it because some people's immune system is weakened or

1164
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.630
they have a predisposition.

1165
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.830
So heavy metals are everywhere and environmental toxicities everywhere.

1166
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.510
When you look at the fetal cord blood baby just born,

1167
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.080
the average number of toxins in that fetal cord blood 220 average toxins right

1168
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:49.670
out the gate.
60 of those are known carcinogens right out the gate.

1169
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:53.180
You're already like born and we're born into this toxic soup.

1170
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:55.370
So if we know what our genetics are,

1171
01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.430
and Rhonda was talking about this in regards to Doctor Rhonda Patrick the cause

1172
01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:03.950
that was a great podcast you did with Tbi and she was talking about the

1173
01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:08.270
predisposition towards Alzheimer's.
You have these eight po e type for genetics.

1174
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.100
Well,
if you put that genetic profile on top of a traumatic brain injury,

1175
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.480
now you just have an increase in your Alzheimer's risk tenfold.

1176
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:22.720
<v 4>Do you think that people are hesitant to,
um,</v>

1177
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:24.310
to,

1178
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.570
to look at sugar the same way you're describing it because it doesn't have the,

1179
01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.810
like when you say that sugar is more addictive in some studies than heroin,

1180
01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.150
people will go off.
That's fucking horse shit.

1181
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:36.520
But it's because they effect of sugar.

1182
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:39.910
It doesn't have the profound effect on the body that heroin does the actual

1183
01:10:39.911 --> 01:10:40.720
effect.

1184
01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.280
But I think people might confuse that with the addictive properties of it.

1185
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.660
Cause I know a lot of fucking people that are addicted to sugar and they don't

1186
01:10:49.661 --> 01:10:52.360
want to admit it and they die.
They want to pretend that it's just,

1187
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.010
it's normal if they didn't take a day off of sugar and they feel like they did a

1188
01:10:57.011 --> 01:10:59.590
great thing a day,
you know,

1189
01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.220
I mean I don't know if heroin junkies needed every day,

1190
01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:06.310
if they could take a couple of days off.
But I've,

1191
01:11:06.311 --> 01:11:11.020
I've seen friends that he eat candy or drink soda and those motherfuckers,
they,

1192
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.070
they,
it calls them,
it calls them after

1193
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.880
<v 5>every meal,
after every meal.
They have to finish it with something sweet.</v>

1194
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.110
You have to have a dessert.
And I've,

1195
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:23.670
I've con I've felt myself go in and out of these modes where it's like I want a

1196
01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:27.560
piece of chocolate or something after almost every meal.
No.

1197
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.590
And then I'll be off to be like,
Whoa,
whoa.
What is that?
Yeah.
Like why,

1198
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.630
why am I so compelled to do that?

1199
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:37.500
And the more stressed I am and the more I am doing things,

1200
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:38.880
just kind of an autopilot,

1201
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:42.930
the more I just do that without even thinking like the more if I've been in a

1202
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:46.320
recent medicine journey or if I've gone floating or if I've kept up with my

1203
01:11:46.321 --> 01:11:50.970
meditation practice,
well then I can like stop and reflect and be like,

1204
01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:54.210
okay,
here's this urge welling up inside me.

1205
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.020
Do I want to say she ate it or do I want to,
you know,

1206
01:11:58.021 --> 01:12:00.960
deny it and you have more conscious control of it.

1207
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.240
And then at that point you can really make a decision.

1208
01:12:03.241 --> 01:12:05.910
But when you're just caught up in momentum,
you know,

1209
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:08.610
we're such creatures of momentum that that's,

1210
01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:12.570
you have to halt the momentum with what the native Americans would call the

1211
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:13.500
sacred silence,

1212
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:17.850
which is anything that brings you to a point of presence where you can really

1213
01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:22.380
access free will and just kind of stop all this momentum that's going is why the

1214
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:26.760
tank is so great.
Ultimate nature meditation.

1215
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.780
I mean all of these things,
you know I was,
I'm reading this book right now,

1216
01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:35.640
but by Tom Brown called awakening spirits and he gives this really cool little

1217
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:38.640
fable that explains it.
So they'll tell the fable here.

1218
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.180
So there's this guy who lives in the woods with a wizard and this wizard has a

1219
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:44.100
demon that can accomplish any task.

1220
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:48.090
So the guy wants to capture this wizard and get the demon cause he wants to

1221
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:51.870
accomplish any task.
So he finds the wizard and meditation down by the Stream,

1222
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.700
throws a rope around him,
cinches it tight and the wizard looks at him and says,

1223
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.100
you've come from my demon,
haven't you?
Says yes,

1224
01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:02.040
I've come to the game and give it to me or I won't let you go.
It says,

1225
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.550
that's fine,
I'll give you the demon.
But I have to tell you,

1226
01:13:05.551 --> 01:13:08.190
the demon will do anything you want,
but you have to keep it busy.

1227
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.940
If you don't keep it busy,
it will go angry.
It'll grow hostile,

1228
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.800
it will seek to destroy you.
He says,
fine,
fine,
no matter what,
whatever.

1229
01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:17.010
I'll keep it busy.
There's plenty of stuff to do was it says,
sure,

1230
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.930
the demon will be waiting for you back to your house.

1231
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:23.550
So it goes back to his house and there's the demon.
It's a nice,

1232
01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:26.670
humble servant,
says,
what can I do for you master?
He says,

1233
01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:28.140
I'll go fetch me a cup of water,

1234
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.810
and the demon goes out and comes right back with a cup of water.
It says,

1235
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.090
it has done drinks the water.
He says,
what else would you have me do?
He says,
ah,

1236
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:39.360
go make me a feast.
Go Hunt some game and make me a feast.

1237
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:44.190
So demon goes out and makes them a feast,
comes back,
it has done,
and B,

1238
01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:46.200
even before he could finish eating it,

1239
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.380
the demon starts growing more angry and bigger and says,

1240
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:52.140
what will you have me do?
What will you have me do?
It says,
ah,

1241
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:56.700
built me a new house.
Okay,
so the demon goes off and gets a moment of rest.

1242
01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.300
The demon comes back,
says it has done.
The man looks up.
Sure enough,

1243
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:03.620
there's the house built and he runs out of things.
He starts to panic.

1244
01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:08.550
He runs out of things to do.
So he's freaking out.

1245
01:14:08.551 --> 01:14:12.160
He runs back to where the wizard was.
It said,
wizard,
I can't,
I can't stop

1246
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.790
<v 6>it.
The,
I can't give the demon enough things to do.
And the wizard says,
you know,</v>

1247
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.800
with compassion says pull a hair from your head and tell the demon to straighten

1248
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:24.550
the hair.
And he says,
okay,
I guess I'll try that.

1249
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:27.910
So he runs back and at this point that the demon is fully out of control.

1250
01:14:27.911 --> 01:14:29.020
It's destroying his house.

1251
01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:31.150
It's destroying all the things that he loves about his house.

1252
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.630
So he pulls the hair from his head and he says,
straighten this hair.

1253
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:40.000
And so the demon gets the hair it sa tries to straighten it and the hair goes

1254
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:42.940
back to curly,
tries to straighten the hair,
goes back to curly,

1255
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:44.080
strives to straighten it hair.

1256
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:47.200
It goes back to curly and all of a sudden the demon shrinks in size.

1257
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:49.330
And so in this fable,

1258
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:53.560
the demon is our minds and our minds are constantly requiring,
you know,

1259
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:55.600
what will you have me do?
What will you have me do?

1260
01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:00.130
And many of these techniques that we use,
they like into the hair.

1261
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.570
It's something that allows the mind,
gives it a moment of distraction,

1262
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.250
gives it something to occupy.
It,

1263
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.280
puts it to sleep so that we can use the mind is a servant instead of our master.

1264
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:16.940
And so all of these things from meditation to floating to Psychedelics,
you know,

1265
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.560
their hairs,
even nature itself is in its way a hair.

1266
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:24.520
Because if you need nature to find that calm,
that's,
you know,

1267
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:28.750
that's the hair you need that walk in the mountains and some hairs are better

1268
01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:29.740
than others,
obviously.

1269
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:34.290
<v 4>I love the story up to the hair part.
I think whoever wrote that store,</v>

1270
01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:38.570
it needed to go back for a second draft.
I like what they're saying,
I,

1271
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:42.580
I catch it,
but straighten the hair out.
This fucking thing can build houses.

1272
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:46.390
It can't straighten the hair out to goddamn demon.
It has powers.
Right.

1273
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.780
Feel like it should of told it.
Uh,

1274
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.630
what I would like you to do is shut the fuck up.

1275
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.870
How about concentrating on shutting the fuck up and doing nothing?

1276
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:56.760
That's what I'd like you to do.
That's your task.
Your task is to do nothing.
Well,

1277
01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:00.110
if Tom Brown,
if you're listening,
you need to rewrite your story touches on it.

1278
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.310
That's what old shit that was written a long time.

1279
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:05.950
But people had a lot of curly hair will be real dumb shit.

1280
01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:10.000
They wrote no on the Ark.
You know,
two of each animal.
The Fuck Outta here.

1281
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.550
The animals eat animals.
What are they doing on that boat?

1282
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:17.170
What do they do when they get off the boat?
You fucked up.

1283
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.030
The guy's made bad stories.
I liked that.
The idea though,

1284
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:26.180
but it,
cause it is kind of true that like,
especially ambition,
you know,

1285
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.970
ambition can get out of control.

1286
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.510
It's like we were what we were discussing earlier today about rich people,

1287
01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.530
that there's a certain amount of rich people that never feel like,
you know,
one,

1288
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:38.770
I've made plenty of money.
I don't have to gouge and,

1289
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040
and fuck over all the people that I do business with and try to rip off everyone

1290
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:49.870
who is,
uh,
you know,
who's working with me.
You know,
you could,

1291
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.040
you could have some sort of a,

1292
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:56.041
a more more peaceful relationship with them if you're less concerned about the

1293
01:16:57.161 --> 01:16:57.850
money.

1294
01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:00.760
And you brought up a really interesting point is that's the only thing they're

1295
01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:01.970
keeping score in.

1296
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:07.430
The only thing where they have like a number system or a a like you could look

1297
01:17:08.801 --> 01:17:10.040
up on the board like look,

1298
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.670
<v 0>we're making progress.
Look at,</v>

1299
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.470
we have a quantifiable progress report right up on the board.

1300
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.630
And those things become,

1301
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.810
it becomes a part of who you are as a human being,

1302
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:25.400
how you interface with this reality and your self worth and your,

1303
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.760
how you,
uh,

1304
01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:29.930
w the way you appreciate yourself and the way you feel about yourself.

1305
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:34.931
Your confidence is oftentimes based entirely on how those numbers are moving and

1306
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:38.030
when those,
when it's all just about business,
you know,

1307
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.180
it's about selling computers or whatever the fuck you're doing.
Like,
you know,

1308
01:17:41.181 --> 01:17:45.230
like Steve Jobs I think completely lost the script when you're talking about a

1309
01:17:45.231 --> 01:17:50.231
guy who got into this idea of creating computers and,

1310
01:17:50.771 --> 01:17:54.680
and,
and,
and figuring out something that the fix the world through psychedelics.

1311
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:59.570
He got into it through LSD and these LSD experiences that he had.

1312
01:17:59.571 --> 01:18:03.020
He said,
where were some of the most powerful experiences of his life?
Well,

1313
01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:06.560
what did it lead to lead to a guy who was fucking not,

1314
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:08.390
it was working 20 hours a day,

1315
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:13.630
just making computers all the time and trying to stop the competition and shut

1316
01:18:13.691 --> 01:18:17.480
down anyone that would oppose him and yelling at his employees,

1317
01:18:17.481 --> 01:18:20.390
screaming at them,
even for not working as hard as he worked,

1318
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:24.290
like not recognizing that they're just individuals that are working for him.

1319
01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:28.520
They're not going to share that same sort of psychotic passion.
Yeah,

1320
01:18:28.521 --> 01:18:32.780
I mean I think we're all,
we're all hungry for more.
We're insatiable creatures.

1321
01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:35.720
We ought,
we require more air,
we require more food.

1322
01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:40.500
We require more water where generally insatiable beings and we require progress.

1323
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:44.900
You know,
that's one of the things we require puzzles.
And the problem is,

1324
01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:48.860
is that there's a hunger inside ourselves that oftentimes we don't know where

1325
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:53.990
the,
where the mouth is defeat it.
And that's this,
you know,
this true peace,
this,

1326
01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:58.430
this alignment and reconciliation with our consciousness that whatever higher

1327
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:00.770
self that is,
call it spirit,
call it whatever you want.

1328
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.340
I prefer to call it your consciousness.
And the problem is,

1329
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:07.460
is that it's really close to the other stomachs,
but it's not it.

1330
01:19:07.461 --> 01:19:10.340
So people try to feed it with accomplishments,
with money,

1331
01:19:10.341 --> 01:19:14.780
and they feed it with relationships and status and all of these other things,

1332
01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:18.710
but they're not actually nourishing what that real hunger is.

1333
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.860
And that's the hunger to be what we're capable of.

1334
01:19:21.861 --> 01:19:26.861
Being on a true consciousness level and a being that can help make the lives of

1335
01:19:26.931 --> 01:19:31.931
everyone else around us better improve the quality of life for the earth and

1336
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:34.860
everybody around.
Yeah.
That's,
uh,

1337
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.800
it's so hard to grasp if you're not in that mindset.

1338
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:44.630
It's so hard to,
to leave the momentum of your current mindset,

1339
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.620
whether it's a current mindset that loves to gamble or the current mindset loves

1340
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:51.680
to stuff your fat face with cake,
whatever it is.

1341
01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.980
Those mindsets that those patterns of behavior are incredibly difficult to

1342
01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:58.064
escape from.

1343
01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:01.490
And it's one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you about food addictions cause

1344
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:06.380
it seems to me that it's got,
I don't,
I don't really have a food addiction,

1345
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:07.980
but would imagine that

1346
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.670
<v 4>they're probably one of the hardest to kick because everybody has to eat
totally.</v>

1347
01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:15.930
You have to eat.
Yeah.
So while you're eating and you're like,
yeah,

1348
01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:17.820
the salary is good,
but fuck,

1349
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:20.850
it would be awesome if I had some chocolate ice cream right now.

1350
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:25.980
What some whipped cream and chocolate fudge,
you know,
those,
those,
uh,

1351
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:31.010
those whole filling,
longing,
lust,

1352
01:20:31.011 --> 01:20:36.011
full sort of intense cravings that some people have towards food.

1353
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.660
I've seen friends that have food addictions that are,

1354
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:43.550
that when they do get that food,
like,
you know,
we're maybe driving somewhere,

1355
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:44.430
maybe we're hungry.
Me,

1356
01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:47.640
we just landed and we're on our way from the airport to get food.

1357
01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:49.730
When they get finally get that food,
it's like a fucking guy.

1358
01:20:49.731 --> 01:20:53.120
He's been holding his breath at the bottom of the ocean.
They can't.

1359
01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:58.020
This is all ah,
ah,
ah.
It's like,
like you just,

1360
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.080
you just did something like you,

1361
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:04.890
you kept yourself from my precious for so long.
Then when you finally in the,

1362
01:21:04.891 --> 01:21:08.340
in the presence of it,
you just gorging it.

1363
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:11.430
We fucking forget to breathe.
You're not breathing.

1364
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:13.770
I've seen guys eat or they're not breathing.

1365
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.590
You're not like taking a buy.
You are fine.

1366
01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:23.340
Five minutes ago you were beating,
your heart was beating,
you were breathing,

1367
01:21:23.341 --> 01:21:24.570
you are walking your feet,

1368
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.780
but then all of a sudden that chicken parm sub comes your way and you're just

1369
01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:32.610
stuffing into your fucking mall.
That's a weird addiction,

1370
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:33.120
man.

1371
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.890
It's a weird addiction and that imbalance of massive necessity,

1372
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.050
you know,
it's necessary to get it in me right now even though it's not really.

1373
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:46.340
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Food addiction is,
is one of the trickier ones,</v>

1374
01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:51.110
and not everybody's going to do a psychedelic,
right.
So for the vast majority,

1375
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.750
like not everybody's going to climb Everest and when you climb Everest,

1376
01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:57.410
it's going to have a map and a team and the guide and all that stuff.

1377
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.450
<v 4>Don't sit there when there's an earthquake.
Right?
Right.</v>

1378
01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.280
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
You want them to set and setting,
right.
Same thing.
So what are,</v>

1379
01:22:04.281 --> 01:22:06.890
what is most people are going to do?
Well when you,

1380
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.320
when you transition off of something that's so ubiquitous,

1381
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.640
it's super helpful to have motivation because it's not going to be an easy

1382
01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:18.260
journey.
It's super helpful to have a guide and a plan and it's super helpful to

1383
01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.000
integrate that plan and stay,
you know,
stick to it.
So sugar,
um,

1384
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:24.080
there's a,

1385
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:29.080
Jj virgin is a really well known author in the whole addiction realm,

1386
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:32.540
particularly in regards to sugar.
She's got a pretty successful plan.

1387
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:34.400
Basically it entails,

1388
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:39.430
I'm stepping down and then transitioning from sugars that are really crappy to

1389
01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:43.610
sugars that are better and then less of those sugars that are better to

1390
01:22:43.611 --> 01:22:45.950
eventually on extraordinarily or no sugar diet.

1391
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:51.370
So you gradually step that down and outside of having a really good motivation,

1392
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:55.580
sometimes people won't stay stay with it like,
oh this is just too hard.

1393
01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.570
But if your motivation is like,
wow,
I just went to the doctor and I've got like,

1394
01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:04.110
you know,
90% stenosis on one of my,
um,

1395
01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:08.290
heart arteries and I'm really close to having an another heart attack,

1396
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.690
or I'm morbidly obese and some,

1397
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:14.500
and I just got that major self reflection about how my life's just horrible

1398
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:17.530
right now.
Or I'm in this,
you know,
suicidal depression and whatever,

1399
01:23:17.531 --> 01:23:19.480
whatever people's motivation is,

1400
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:24.750
that crisis point can actually help people motivate them to a new trajectory.

1401
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:29.080
So that's why often have you here with,
with anybody going through an addiction,

1402
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:31.960
particularly with alcoholics and they haven't hit rock bottom.

1403
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.700
And once you've motivated and you've,
you've come up with a plan,

1404
01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:40.810
whatever that plan is to be able to stick to it is also important than to have

1405
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.990
ongoing support,
especially if these are dangerous addictions.

1406
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:48.991
Like my sister committed suicide a year and a half ago after she relapsed on

1407
01:23:49.301 --> 01:23:53.560
alcohol and no one saw it coming.
And she shot and killed herself.

1408
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:59.170
And it was a really big shock and it,
it really helped,

1409
01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:00.063
um,

1410
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:05.250
remind me of the importance of ongoing support and being consistently,

1411
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.820
um,

1412
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:11.820
interfacing with conscious people in our family and supportive tribe and our

1413
01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:15.370
brothers and sisters,
like really watching out for each other,
really checking in,

1414
01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.860
making sure there's not anything going on in deeper level,

1415
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:23.040
having that honest inventory versus just playing on the surface and ignoring

1416
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:28.090
everything that's in the background.
And,
and this life is precious,

1417
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.990
right?
So when we engage it in a good way and we're becoming our best self,

1418
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:36.250
then we have the opportunity to really create massive beneficial change in the

1419
01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:38.550
world.
And many people are,

1420
01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.920
are playing on the surface and we don't exactly even know how to get in touch

1421
01:24:41.921 --> 01:24:45.460
with ourselves or what we want to do or what our mission is here in life.

1422
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:50.950
And so coming back to that whole addiction rewrite,

1423
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.031
there's steps,

1424
01:24:52.031 --> 01:24:55.960
there's a very clear steps along the path and sugar's one of those that is

1425
01:24:55.961 --> 01:24:59.720
because it's so ubiquitous or like technology.
Um,

1426
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
I used to help run a clinic called alternative to meds in Sedona and another

1427
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:07.510
place called the sanctuary in Sedona to different centers.

1428
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:10.300
But oftentimes people will come for addiction recovery.

1429
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:14.710
And one of the trickiest ones that we ever saw was this addiction to technology,

1430
01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:19.540
whether it was pornography or just being on the Internet for so long,
um,

1431
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:23.470
or whatever kind of addiction profile in the technology arena.

1432
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.900
Because it's like sugar,
it's so ubiquitous.

1433
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:28.570
It's not like you're going to just say no and I'm never going to do that again.

1434
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.540
It's like,
so at that point it's,

1435
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.810
it's even coming back to that moderation planets even more helpful to have an

1436
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:39.870
ongoing support system and person in place and recovery coach move you through

1437
01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:43.990
that process.
So sugar is one of those that,
because it's a physiologic addiction,

1438
01:25:43.991 --> 01:25:47.050
the body does get used to it or caffeine.
It does get used to it.

1439
01:25:47.051 --> 01:25:50.590
So if people are jacked up on coffee,
you transitioned a black tea,

1440
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:55.570
then you transition to green tea and then you transitioned to no caffeine,

1441
01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.290
really set somebody up for success versus saying,
Oh,
you're on coffee,

1442
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:03.980
then stop it cold Turkey and suffer for you know,
a to 10 days.

1443
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.370
Most people are going to want to do it that way and it doesn't actually have to

1444
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.250
go that way.
You can actually come up with a pretty successful plan.

1445
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:12.620
You just have to be rock solid and committed to it.

1446
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:15.950
When you're talking about Ken Dda and gut bacteria,
how much of a,

1447
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.530
when when you try to help someone get off that,

1448
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.970
how much emphasis do you put on probiotics?
Massive.
Massive.

1449
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.870
Because there's going to be a die off and that that die off and that toxicity

1450
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:30.320
that the candied is going to release or Paris in like if you're clearing

1451
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:34.430
parasites,
same thing.
So parasites are another buffer.
And we,

1452
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:38.780
we have grown and we were talking about this before,
we've,

1453
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.960
we've grown over generations in traditional cultures to be symbiotic with,

1454
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.770
with uh,
parasites in our environment.
Like we live together.

1455
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.200
And you see these traditional cultures like that are very untouched by western

1456
01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:55.900
food and by Western marketing,

1457
01:26:55.901 --> 01:27:00.770
when by Western influence and when you look at their microbiome or you look at

1458
01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:01.760
their gut flora,

1459
01:27:01.761 --> 01:27:06.761
they have the most rich and diverse gut flora and the ones that we usually have

1460
01:27:07.521 --> 01:27:12.521
in like probiotic strains are just a fraction of everybody who's playing.

1461
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:18.340
And so you've got these massively complex and extraordinarily sophisticated gut

1462
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:25.060
probiotic populations that help us metabolize and even produce a lot of them

1463
01:27:27.101 --> 01:27:31.040
micronutrients that we need for our most vital living.

1464
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:37.130
And when you look at the longterm ramifications of being able to reinfeldt
trait,

1465
01:27:37.131 --> 01:27:42.131
and so there's this whole movement now around fecal transplants and being able

1466
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:46.550
to identify somebody who's got a really healthy microbiome or healthy gut flora,

1467
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.100
they have a healthy neurological system.

1468
01:27:49.101 --> 01:27:54.101
They're just generally vital as a source for a potential gut fecal transplant.

1469
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.660
And when you look at people who are kind of the opposite of that,

1470
01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:00.830
they have long standing,

1471
01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:04.910
irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease or some kind of autoimmune
infection.

1472
01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.590
There's a,
there's a,

1473
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:11.591
there's a whole science around using parasites is actually a beneficial step.

1474
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.970
It's called helminthic therapy.

1475
01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:19.150
We actually receive hookworms into the system and the hookworms kind of move

1476
01:28:20.121 --> 01:28:24.770
everything else out and lower the inflammatory load and help to rewrite some of

1477
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:27.740
that autoimmune cascade.

1478
01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:31.280
So then once that autoimmune cascade has rewritten,

1479
01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:34.940
then you bring in the healthy probiotics.
So there's,

1480
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:38.240
there's a whole science to the gut,

1481
01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:43.610
body and mind interface.
It's where there's a really good book,
I think,

1482
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.130
by getting Gerson called the second brain.

1483
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:51.580
And it's this whole deep scientific look at the gut brain connection and how

1484
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:58.490
many of the neurotransmitters and what build the neuro transmitters that

1485
01:28:58.491 --> 01:29:02.280
actually starts in the gut.
Like most of the serotonin system comes from the gut.

1486
01:29:02.281 --> 01:29:03.450
It doesn't come from the brain,

1487
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:07.140
it's produced in the gut and it's transported to the brain for activity.

1488
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:10.800
So people that talk about feeling like shit,
it's because they're,
they're,

1489
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.840
they're full of Shit,
right?

1490
01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:17.090
So we need to actually start with the gut.
Isn't it

1491
01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:22.060
<v 4>amazing how much diet and what you take into your body has an effect on your</v>

1492
01:29:22.061 --> 01:29:25.030
mind itself?
I mean,
it really,
really,

1493
01:29:25.031 --> 01:29:30.031
truly is amazing how much what you put into your body has an impact on how your

1494
01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:35.650
brain functions and the fact that we never get taught that our bodies are

1495
01:29:35.651 --> 01:29:40.210
essentially a biological ecosphere.
I mean,
your,

1496
01:29:40.211 --> 01:29:43.750
your bodies are essentially not one thing.
You're,

1497
01:29:43.751 --> 01:29:48.751
but your bodies are like a host of untold billions of little tiny microscopic

1498
01:29:51.311 --> 01:29:54.940
life forms that exist.
And if they're in an unhealthy state,

1499
01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:58.420
you'll be in an unhealthy state.
But if they're in a healthy state,

1500
01:29:58.421 --> 01:30:00.410
you'll feel better.
The,
the,
the,

1501
01:30:00.411 --> 01:30:04.600
the studies that they've done on probiotic gut content and the effect that it

1502
01:30:04.601 --> 01:30:05.950
has on depression.

1503
01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.840
<v 3>Massive.
It's insane.
Massive anxiety to anxiety,</v>

1504
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:14.440
right?
You,
you,
you,
you have like a healthy rat population and ancient,
uh,

1505
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:17.910
anxious rat population.
You take out their poop and you transplant it.

1506
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:21.680
You just turn the healthy rats into anxious rats in the anxious rats,

1507
01:30:21.681 --> 01:30:23.520
in a healthy rats.
In all fairness,

1508
01:30:23.521 --> 01:30:25.290
you're fucking with her butt and sticking improvement.

1509
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.220
External factors
like I was fine.

1510
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.410
They started metal rod up.
My ass man has nothing to do with the pope.

1511
01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.310
You put in there.
Like,
I'm wondering when the next fucking shoe's going to drop.

1512
01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.870
We haven't gotten sophisticated yet and being able to like measure like how rats

1513
01:30:42.871 --> 01:30:44.460
feel cool we have about that.

1514
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.330
Be Able to press a button and freeze them in time so they don't know what we're

1515
01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:49.930
doing to them.
Right.
You know,

1516
01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:53.430
it's an interesting thing because there was a study that was done on rats with

1517
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:54.020
Coke Keynes,

1518
01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.070
<v 4>a very famous study,</v>

1519
01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.520
the difference between cocaine and heroin and rats and that if you give these

1520
01:30:58.521 --> 01:31:02.790
rats cocaine,
they'll do cocaine until they die.
The problem with that study,

1521
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.930
it's been brought up,
uh,
I forget who,
who was on the podcast,

1522
01:31:05.931 --> 01:31:10.640
it brought it up was that you're talking about rats in a fucking cage.

1523
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.100
<v 3>Yeah.
What else can take do?</v>

1524
01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.850
The cage itself is a part of the study and the followup study to that showed

1525
01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:21.851
that when they're put in a rat park and they're still given unlimited supply of

1526
01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:25.070
cocaine.
So in in isolation,

1527
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.480
rats with unlimited supply of cocaine,
more than 75% will be heavy users.

1528
01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:34.660
And a lot of lethality when that same unlimited supply of cocaine is put in the

1529
01:31:34.701 --> 01:31:36.650
setting of what's called the rat park,

1530
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.500
where you're now you're like hanging out with a rat rat,
hookers,

1531
01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:45.220
you got back the rat rat softball game going on all of your options,

1532
01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.390
joggers got mouse racing,
you've got all kinds of shit.

1533
01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:54.380
And when you've got all this great stuff and stimulation around you,

1534
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:59.770
you've just went from over 75 heavy users to less than 25% heavy users and know

1535
01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:06.430
lethality,
right?
So you,
you,
because of the social stimulation.

1536
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:10.510
So addiction is about connecting,
life is about connection,
right?

1537
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:11.700
So that address,

1538
01:32:11.701 --> 01:32:15.640
that ability to connect to like a stimulating environment,

1539
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.790
the social mill,
you significantly drops the,

1540
01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.110
the drug use,
even if you have the same amount.

1541
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:27.910
And same thing with Portugal when they legalized all drugs.

1542
01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:31.520
Uh,
and that would be decriminalized.
I was that correct?
Yeah.

1543
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.350
Decriminalized and sell them.
But yeah,
yeah.
Sorry.
Good.
Yeah.
Right.

1544
01:32:35.351 --> 01:32:38.980
So when decriminalization happened and then they shifted all their money from

1545
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:43.090
the war on drugs into social infrastructure and started to boost up the social

1546
01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:48.091
mill you and started to de stigmatize the addiction nomenclature and that label

1547
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.660
like something's wrong with you.

1548
01:32:52.661 --> 01:32:56.680
Like actually let's talk about what's going on in your social arena and how we

1549
01:32:56.681 --> 01:33:01.330
can help that.
It was a complete rewrite and drug use went down,

1550
01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:02.860
lethality went down.

1551
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:08.620
So we're recognizing just more and more and these like we as these like,

1552
01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:10.570
you know,
monkeys walking around in these suits,

1553
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:14.980
we are built for a connection and win.
That's why,
you know,
are our,

1554
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.930
the first part of our whole discussion today around people doing,
you know,

1555
01:33:19.931 --> 01:33:24.931
thumb desk jockey and getting really absorbed into that whole gamification arena

1556
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:26.950
and the whole video gaming industry.

1557
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:32.010
I get concerned about the social developmental ramifications.
Like what,

1558
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.490
what's the potential end result and does the,

1559
01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:42.220
is is that beneficial for,
you know,
for the evolution of our species,

1560
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:46.810
so so to speak or is it going to end up being like idiocracy where generations

1561
01:33:46.811 --> 01:33:47.620
down the load

1562
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.620
<v 5>down the road we just get dumber and dumber and then you know,</v>

1563
01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:52.600
the president is a,
I think it really just needs to be,

1564
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:54.310
it depends on title holder.

1565
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:57.840
It depends on just how much addiction you have to,

1566
01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.580
whether it crosses that threshold.
Because I played a lot of video games,

1567
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:03.250
they kind of sucked back when I was a kid.
But you know,

1568
01:34:03.251 --> 01:34:06.640
it was always the balance was I play some video games and then run around

1569
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:10.940
outside play basketball or kick a ball around or do whatever.
And,

1570
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:14.350
but I played it.
I mean I played a good amount.
There was days I would play six,

1571
01:34:14.351 --> 01:34:19.351
eight hours a dragon warrior or final fantasy or whether he's in the game grand

1572
01:34:19.661 --> 01:34:23.050
scheme of things.
You were probably doing much more athletics,
social,

1573
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.500
but still it was just about,
you know,
about balance.
And I think again,

1574
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:29.620
that same message,
if we demonize video games,
the kids are going to be like,

1575
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:33.550
fuck you.
Because they know that that's inherently not the problem.

1576
01:34:33.551 --> 01:34:34.291
The problem is,

1577
01:34:34.291 --> 01:34:39.250
is identifying when something good like sex becomes something not good like

1578
01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:43.270
addiction to sex.
If that thing is even real.
I mean I imagine it is.
Totally.
Yeah.

1579
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:47.890
Okay.
Sex Addiction is extraordinarily addiction to washing your hands.
Yeah.

1580
01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.750
People have addictions to everything.

1581
01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.250
I mean there's people that have addictions to they,

1582
01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.130
they really get physically upset if they step on cracks in the sidewalk.
Right.

1583
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:58.070
This is more like an obsessive

1584
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.510
<v 3>compulsive disorder kind of complex,</v>

1585
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.720
but don't you think that there's some sort of an addiction property to that?

1586
01:35:02.721 --> 01:35:06.830
Like you're at OCP is another floor.
Oh,
cds.

1587
01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:11.831
Another really difficult one to to rewrite and interestingly enough,

1588
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:15.950
when you look at the studies,
the angiogenes and the psychedelics,

1589
01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:20.630
they come in again to help rewrite the neurochemistry that's a bit more

1590
01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:23.210
serotonin and driven and nuts.
So much dopamine driven.

1591
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:24.620
There's some crossover lap,

1592
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.430
but that's more of an anxiety spectrum disorder versus primary addiction

1593
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:33.431
disorder because those ritualized behaviors have to be done in order to arrest

1594
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:37.570
some underlying compulsion and um,
and,

1595
01:35:37.571 --> 01:35:40.550
and need for perfection and need to have a corrective experience,

1596
01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:44.720
some kind of underlying need.
And so there's the energy around,

1597
01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:45.554
it's a little bit different,

1598
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.600
but at the same time the intervention for success and recovery from that might

1599
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:53.900
be pretty similar because everybody's a little bit different when you look at

1600
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:57.470
the data.
People that have significant anxiety,

1601
01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:01.230
and this actually came up with floating too two years ago,

1602
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:04.730
Justin Feinstein talked about flow to at the float conference.

1603
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:08.900
He was talking about the benefits of flotation for anxiety and people with

1604
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:13.430
generalized anxiety disorder after 10 floats had significant reduction in their

1605
01:36:13.431 --> 01:36:17.960
symptoms,
like by the order of like 30%.
And people with,

1606
01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.930
um,
uh,
obsessive compulsive disorder,

1607
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.770
significant improvement in symptoms when going through a psychedelic experience

1608
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:27.560
like Iowaska.
So you've got these,
again,

1609
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:31.820
the really novel treatments and Therapeutics and more honestly,

1610
01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:34.970
more people are going to float,
then more people are going to do psychedelics.

1611
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.300
But again,
it just becomes a really wide array of our,

1612
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:42.080
of our tool belt and knowing how to meet people where they're at,

1613
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:45.440
recommend the rights,
the right approach for them at that time.

1614
01:36:45.441 --> 01:36:49.850
Oftentimes floating is a gateway to do other things like clean up the Diet,

1615
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:53.270
clean up your social environment and get more on track with your purpose and

1616
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:56.210
your passion.
Cause like when you're driving your purpose and your passion,

1617
01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.480
all of a sudden there's less bandwidth that even has room to play with other

1618
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:06.320
behaviors and other addictions that might not be getting you to that point.

1619
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.770
<v 4>Yeah.
I,
I,</v>

1620
01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:13.610
I've got to think that momentum plays a huge factor in a lot of people's lives

1621
01:37:13.611 --> 01:37:18.420
and their decisions both good and bad.
When people are on the,

1622
01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.900
the bender momentum,

1623
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.090
they're getting drunk every night and they're fucking up every night.

1624
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:24.650
It becomes their life.

1625
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:28.730
Whereas the momentum of positivity that becomes their life.

1626
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.380
When you start talking about expressions and sayings like one day at a time.
The,

1627
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:37.170
the issues that I have with that,
uh,

1628
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:42.020
I'm talking completely out of ignorance because I'm not an alcoholic and I never

1629
01:37:42.021 --> 01:37:44.600
have been.
But if I was,

1630
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:47.490
I would like to think that I could just get rid of it.

1631
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:51.770
It doesn't have to be one day at a time.
Like why,
why is it one day at a time?

1632
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:56.160
Well,
I wake up tomorrow,
am I going to be,
am I going to fuck up?
Like am I putting

1633
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:56.910
<v 0>that out there?</v>

1634
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:59.820
That one day at a time means let's just take this one day at a time.

1635
01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.170
I'm sober one day at a time.
How want I'm fucking sober.
How about this is me,

1636
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:06.360
I learned from the past and I'm sober now,

1637
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:09.740
but the people that are into that 12 step shit,
the,

1638
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:13.530
my only concern is they talk a lot like crossfitters.

1639
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.180
They talk like vegans and crossfitters and people that are like really into

1640
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.390
being addicted to what they're into.
They're addicted to sobriety.

1641
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.120
Like they start talking about it all the time.

1642
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:30.000
They start like trying to encourage other people.

1643
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.280
Even people that don't have a problem with alcohol,

1644
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:36.660
like I've had friends that got clean and then they see you have a drink and

1645
01:38:36.661 --> 01:38:41.130
they're like,
they're like,
listen bitch,
see this.
This is a beer.
I like beer.

1646
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:45.120
I'm going to have appear and then I'm done.
Is that okay?
By the way,

1647
01:38:45.121 --> 01:38:46.470
I'm going to get up in the morning,
I'm going to run.

1648
01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:49.020
You want to run with me pussy.
He just going to sit in bed and,

1649
01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.640
and it'd say wondered torm I'm going to go have my coffee and my cigarettes

1650
01:38:52.641 --> 01:38:55.050
cause I'm super healthy.
That's the other thing they do.

1651
01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:00.030
They get addicted to something else.
It becomes an addiction to a new thing.

1652
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:02.940
Coffee and cigarettes is a big one with alcoholics.

1653
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:07.740
I mean I know so many fucking alcoholics said,
you see them every day.

1654
01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:10.140
They have a Goddamn Venti Starbucks in their hand.

1655
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.610
They can't get off that tit and it's just,
they've just substitute it.

1656
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.380
Whatever it is that they were trying to fill with the booze,

1657
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:24.500
they've substituted it now with caffeine or with nicotine or with whatever air

1658
01:39:24.521 --> 01:39:27.180
becomes like an identifying part of their story.

1659
01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.260
That's part of their identity.
And I think one of the Lewer,

1660
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.710
one of the lures and the problems with this is when you have this kind of

1661
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:36.780
ascetic principle that's part of your identity,

1662
01:39:36.781 --> 01:39:38.550
you think you're doing great things,

1663
01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:41.160
but you're really just focused entirely on yourself.
It's like,

1664
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.860
I'm doing something great,
I'm eating Vegan.

1665
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.840
Well what is that doing for the world?

1666
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:48.660
That's just something you're doing for yourself.
Fine,
good.

1667
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:53.490
But they act like it's this great burden that they've bore for the rest of

1668
01:39:53.491 --> 01:39:54.990
humanity will do it.

1669
01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.120
There's kind of an argument for that because the less carbon footprint,

1670
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:05.180
less of an impact on the environment with no factory farming or no vested

1671
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:08.970
interest in that.
So there's a modicum of,
there's a modicum of actual benefit,

1672
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:11.190
but in any kind of aesthetic practice,

1673
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:14.670
whether it's not drinking or whether it's not eating meat or whether it's not,

1674
01:40:14.910 --> 01:40:18.000
not doing something not,
not engaging in sex,
you know,

1675
01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:21.840
you can talk to somebody who's celibate and you find these in some yoga

1676
01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:26.490
community.
He's like,
yes,
you know,
I've,
I've not engaged in sex and in a month,

1677
01:40:26.491 --> 01:40:30.090
and they act like they're doing some great service for humanity when really it's

1678
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:32.700
a selfish thing that they're doing fine if you want to do that.

1679
01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:35.550
Any of these things are good.
I'm not saying don't do them,

1680
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.130
but the lure is that because it's a struggle.

1681
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.130
You feel like you're doing something great when really you're just focused

1682
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:42.090
entirely on yourself.
Well,

1683
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:45.660
there's also a competition going on and there's comparing yourself to others,

1684
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:48.600
which is,
it's a natural human instinct.

1685
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:53.601
It's a natural human instinct to gauge your progress based on you,

1686
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:54.360
how

1687
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.990
<v 4>you,
how you stack up with the people that you surround yourself with.
And very,</v>

1688
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:01.750
very few people like to do that in the negative sense.

1689
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:05.680
Like you don't like to look at that in a negative sense.
You know,

1690
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.830
you like to look at it in a positive sense.
Like if you're,
you've,

1691
01:41:08.831 --> 01:41:09.730
you've turned Vegan,

1692
01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:12.970
one of the things that people like to do is say they get really shitty,

1693
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:15.010
especially online like online,

1694
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:19.270
like the ability to communicate with people with no social repercussions,

1695
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:24.190
no queues,
no interaction,
no look at each other eye to eye this,
this shitty,

1696
01:41:24.191 --> 01:41:29.020
nasty things that people say to each other through that and that this,

1697
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:34.350
this Vegan thing that so many people love to do where they are really fucking

1698
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:39.450
angry and nasty and aggressive towards people who aren't Vegan and towards

1699
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:44.671
people who enjoy meat or towards people who hunt and they somehow or another

1700
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:51.781
feel like they're justified in releasing his anger on you and because you're

1701
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:53.590
cruel to animals.

1702
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:57.340
Like I saw something today or someone was talking about there's bears in

1703
01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:59.890
Yellowstone park that we're chasing tourist.
Did you see that video?

1704
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.820
It was pretty crazy video.
These people were all on this,
uh,
this,
this,
uh,

1705
01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.010
bridge and these black bears start chasing these people.

1706
01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:12.580
It's really kind of fucked because there's quite a few people on this bridge and

1707
01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:17.200
they got on a bridge that unfortunately a mother and her cubs got on and the

1708
01:42:17.201 --> 01:42:22.060
mother's kind of freaking out and she's chasing people off.
And so someone,

1709
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:25.000
you know,
someone was like,
man,
fuck those bears.

1710
01:42:25.001 --> 01:42:27.850
Like somebody wrote that on Twitter.
And then some other guy was like,

1711
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:30.760
no fuck people.
You know what people do to this world.

1712
01:42:30.761 --> 01:42:34.150
If you compare what bears do this world and go la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la La.

1713
01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:38.950
And it was like this angry scribe about veganism.
And I'm like,

1714
01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:42.460
went from bears being around people too.

1715
01:42:42.461 --> 01:42:46.960
I'm better than you because I'm a Vegan and people suck.
But bears are awesome.

1716
01:42:46.961 --> 01:42:51.000
That bear will eat your dick off and not give a shit.
You can be screaming.

1717
01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.390
It's living in nature and is trying to keep its babies alive.
Which by the way,

1718
01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:58.390
if it runs into a male bear,
the male bears going to eat the babies.

1719
01:42:58.391 --> 01:43:02.200
So please shut the fuck up with people are worse than bears cause it's

1720
01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:06.040
ridiculous.
If bears had cars,
they would never get their oil changed.

1721
01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.970
They would fucking g drive right over babies.
They wouldn't give a fuck.

1722
01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.650
I'm going to get to the idea,

1723
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:18.100
the idea that somehow or another,
you know,
you,
you have transcended,

1724
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.070
you know,
your,
your need to consume animal protein.

1725
01:43:21.190 --> 01:43:24.780
And so this has transformed,
transferred in,

1726
01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:29.781
in your being somehow to this anger towards people that do consume animal

1727
01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:30.850
protein.

1728
01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:35.850
It's really short sided and it does more harm than it does good because there's

1729
01:43:36.641 --> 01:43:40.000
some really good ideas that are attached to living a vegetarian life.

1730
01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.100
Really good ideas.
And what,

1731
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:45.100
what you're just talking about in regards to both of those groups.

1732
01:43:45.101 --> 01:43:47.950
Like you had the guy who was recovering from alcohol,

1733
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.070
now he was judging you for drinking a beer and you've got vegans who

1734
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.640
<v 3>are judging you for eating meat.
It's the same under,</v>

1735
01:43:55.970 --> 01:44:00.620
under both of those is that same projected um,
bias.

1736
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.670
It's that same judgment that what I'm doing is right and what you're doing is

1737
01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:07.460
wrong.
And when we do that,

1738
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:11.480
we polarize the discussion and to meet some people good.

1739
01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:14.900
And some people bad as opposed to in western medicine has done that to

1740
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:16.970
chiropractic medicine or naturopathic medicine.
I mean,

1741
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:20.870
or the Palestinians have done that to the Israelis are,
I mean the,

1742
01:44:20.871 --> 01:44:25.871
the inherent conflicts that are downstream that caused all the major discourse

1743
01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:30.930
in the world is all about people judging one another and the,

1744
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:35.690
and believing in their bones that their position is right versus coming to the

1745
01:44:35.691 --> 01:44:38.960
table and saying,
let's connect.
Let's have a clear conversation.

1746
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.120
Let me own what is mine.

1747
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:44.660
So if I'm a recovering alcohol and I'm judging you for your alcohol and maybe

1748
01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:49.900
let me own the fact that I'm actually envious of you because I'd really love to

1749
01:44:50.241 --> 01:44:52.010
have a beer,
but for me,

1750
01:44:52.011 --> 01:44:57.011
because of my chemistry or my background or whatever because of who I am and

1751
01:44:58.221 --> 01:45:03.150
what I'm going through right now,
I me having a beer is a bad thing.
Yeah.

1752
01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:07.280
It would lead to a bad outcome.
So I'm going to judge you for yours.

1753
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.210
It doesn't really matter.
You can put the mask on any way you want,

1754
01:45:11.211 --> 01:45:16.211
but underlying that it's people's own inherent ability to be real and okay with

1755
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:22.010
themselves and judging each other as being bad or wrong.
That's the,

1756
01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.110
that's the polarizing conflict.

1757
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:26.090
<v 4>Yeah,
that's a very good point.
It's a very good point.</v>

1758
01:45:26.091 --> 01:45:29.300
And I think it speaks to what we were talking about earlier about competition

1759
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.140
and that this is the only arena where they're keeping score and that some
people,

1760
01:45:34.141 --> 01:45:37.580
they're keeping score with their moral there.
The,
the,
the,

1761
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:39.350
the like the moral score.

1762
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:43.190
Like I am a more moral and more ethical person of you because I choose to live

1763
01:45:43.191 --> 01:45:48.191
my life in this way even though I do all sorts of damage to people's psyche by

1764
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:50.990
being shitty to them.
Because,
you know,

1765
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:53.660
because of the fact that they're not living the same moral life than I do.

1766
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.250
This is the issue that I've had with,
you know,

1767
01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:59.270
the quote unquote social justice warriors of the world,

1768
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:04.370
the people that shame and attack people for having what they believe to be

1769
01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.640
disparaging belief systems or,
or uh,

1770
01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:12.320
people that may be sexist or homophobic or what have you,
instead of,

1771
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:17.800
instead of treating these ideas with a rational discourse and love,

1772
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.471
they,

1773
01:46:19.471 --> 01:46:22.990
they're aggressive and angry and they tried to get people fired and they tried

1774
01:46:22.991 --> 01:46:26.750
to shame people for their ideas.
That doesn't work.
You can't,

1775
01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.510
the human beings don't work like that and you can't communicate like that.

1776
01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:32.570
And what you're doing is essentially the same thing that we're talking about.

1777
01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:37.780
You are now keeping score by shaming or by writing horrible things about these

1778
01:46:40.401 --> 01:46:44.450
people or by attacking them or organizing groups of,

1779
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:49.451
of likeminded fuck heads to go out and attack these people and you're just

1780
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:51.360
creating a competitive,

1781
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.180
sort of a antagonistic combative environment,
right?

1782
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.370
You're not doing any good.
You might feel better yourself.
Like we,
yeah,

1783
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:01.880
we went out there and got them but,
but you know like,

1784
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.510
<v 6>and let's bring that full circle.</v>

1785
01:47:03.511 --> 01:47:07.110
You were talking about bullying before and we can see that starting at a

1786
01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:11.160
playground,
you can actually see that wiring in kid,

1787
01:47:11.161 --> 01:47:14.880
they're keeping score of toughness at that point and that becomes part of the

1788
01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:18.030
thing that they're keeping score.
But then you look at the real masters,

1789
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:22.020
like many of these fighters that we know and you transcend at a certain point,

1790
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:26.640
the masters transcend the idea of keeping score and they just are,
you know,

1791
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:29.850
like the baddest fighters are just tough.
They don't have to show it.

1792
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:33.080
They don't have them to bow up to somebody or bully anybody.

1793
01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:35.130
<v 4>Cain Velasquez,
perfect example.
Exactly.</v>

1794
01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:37.230
He'd ever seen her leave and makeup mean face.

1795
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:40.590
It doesn't have to beat the shit out of everybody.
No mean face.

1796
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:44.740
<v 6>He's not keeping score on toughness anymore.
The game,
he's transcended the game.</v>

1797
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:47.560
And same with anybody in these,
in the mortalities sphere,

1798
01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:51.370
if they're attacking people and it's just showing their,
you know,

1799
01:47:51.670 --> 01:47:56.230
kind of amateur nature in that game,
in this kind of lack of mastery of that.

1800
01:47:56.231 --> 01:47:57.790
Because the true spiritual masters,

1801
01:47:57.791 --> 01:48:00.610
those people who really are the most morally impeccable people,

1802
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:02.400
they're not doing that shit.
They've tent,

1803
01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.040
they've transcended keeping score people healthy relationship in business.

1804
01:48:06.041 --> 01:48:09.790
You know,
you see that like Elon Musk giving away all his patents and things.

1805
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.370
I don't know him personally,
I can't vouch that he's perfect,

1806
01:48:12.371 --> 01:48:16.270
but you start to see principals of,
Hey,
let's just share.

1807
01:48:16.271 --> 01:48:20.620
There's enough to go around and they've transcended this score keeping
mentality.

1808
01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.940
And that's true mastery.
You know,

1809
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:27.700
when you get to that level rather than this really poor rural kind of game of

1810
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:31.720
such return aligned at that point,
you,

1811
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:34.660
you now like the internal scorekeeper.
I don't,

1812
01:48:34.930 --> 01:48:37.510
I'm not looking at you to get my own validation.

1813
01:48:37.511 --> 01:48:41.500
So I don't need to aggressively try and sell my approach.

1814
01:48:41.501 --> 01:48:45.160
I don't need to prove to you that I'm right and then get your feedback.

1815
01:48:45.161 --> 01:48:49.660
So I feel better about myself.
Know essentially we internalize over time.

1816
01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:52.540
Some people have it kind of out the gate because of good parenting or good

1817
01:48:52.541 --> 01:48:54.130
genetics are a whole host of other things.

1818
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:57.150
Some people develop it over time through on personal mastery,

1819
01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.160
be able to like walk in the world with that self confidence that you you,

1820
01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.860
you were already like you used the word a lot,
which I appreciate,

1821
01:49:05.861 --> 01:49:09.430
which is impeccability.
We're already walking and impeccable life.

1822
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:14.790
We're already aligned with everything that we feel is important for us to do in

1823
01:49:14.891 --> 01:49:15.610
the world.

1824
01:49:15.610 --> 01:49:20.290
We've internalized that self referencing ability to be content,

1825
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:25.750
whether it's content in the tank or content across the the discussion platform.

1826
01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:28.720
<v 4>I think you have to have varying disciplines in your life as well.</v>

1827
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:32.230
I don't think concentrating on one thing for any long period of time,

1828
01:49:32.231 --> 01:49:34.360
although I've done it many times in my life.

1829
01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.650
I don't think it's ultimately healthy.
I think it's,

1830
01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:42.670
it's very good short term to achieve great success in a small amount of time or

1831
01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:44.410
a relatively small amount of time.

1832
01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.990
But I think that ultimately that is one of the,

1833
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.140
that can trip you up if your whole world say,
you know,

1834
01:49:50.141 --> 01:49:52.090
back to what we're saying here,
like a computer company.

1835
01:49:52.091 --> 01:49:54.970
If you own a computer company,
if your whole world is that computer company,

1836
01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:56.980
I think that's ultimately very unhealthy.

1837
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:59.710
But if you have this computer company and then you start getting into Jujitsu,

1838
01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:03.550
like you might,
we might relax a little bit about the fucking computer company.

1839
01:50:03.551 --> 01:50:05.260
I realize like,
oh,
okay.

1840
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.860
Like there's a lot of different things I can kind of like put this energy

1841
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:13.000
towards and some of them actually enhance my human potential.

1842
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:18.090
They actually develop me as a human being and not getting so caught up in those

1843
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:20.740
numbers.
Like there's a lot of people that will look at things.

1844
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:23.240
This is a really common thing to say like,
uh,

1845
01:50:23.370 --> 01:50:25.720
like you'll see a guy like bill gates,
man,
if I had his money,

1846
01:50:25.721 --> 01:50:28.780
I wouldn't fucking work at all.
Yeah.
That's why you'll never have his money.

1847
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:33.010
He just like the type of guy that becomes a bill.

1848
01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.940
Gates is a fucking obsessed dude.
You,
you,
you,

1849
01:50:36.941 --> 01:50:41.941
you have to have this insane mindset towards progress and towards continuing to

1850
01:50:45.251 --> 01:50:48.490
move the number,
come,
continuing to move that needle.

1851
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:51.820
And that's the only way you get to develop a company like Microsoft.

1852
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:55.750
You have to hire like minded folks and you have to all compete together as a

1853
01:50:55.751 --> 01:50:58.720
team to try to achieve world dominance.

1854
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:02.440
And something is lucrative as the computer market.
It's the only way you,
you,

1855
01:51:02.441 --> 01:51:06.430
you don't get there by being like some casual dude who like,
you know,

1856
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:10.440
likes to take a lot of time off and work on myself and you know,
no,
you know,

1857
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:13.680
you get up Bill Gates body,
he look all goofy as fuck.
You know,

1858
01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:16.000
that dude doesn't do dead lifts.
Look at Bill Gates.

1859
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:19.490
Bill Gates has no submission defense,
but take us back.

1860
01:51:19.491 --> 01:51:22.560
He just immediately taps why?

1861
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:27.630
Cause he's put all of his energy into creating this Microsoft monolithic empire.

1862
01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:32.800
That's is unstoppable at this point.
And it's probably,

1863
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:34.600
I mean it's sort of semiretired now,

1864
01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:36.940
but I think a lot of that has to do with age,
you know,

1865
01:51:36.941 --> 01:51:40.690
and once you got 90 fucking billion dollars in the bank,

1866
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.960
they're also comes to this point where like I don't,
I can't even spend this.

1867
01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:46.060
Like I literally can't spend this.

1868
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:50.620
So I think that having varying disciplines,

1869
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:54.700
like I do a lot of different things and I didn't know ways,

1870
01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:56.620
but in doing a lot of different things,

1871
01:51:56.621 --> 01:52:01.621
doing martial arts and playing pool and then doing a meditation and getting the

1872
01:52:01.691 --> 01:52:06.691
tank and doing standup comedy and doing podcasts and fight commentary and all

1873
01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:11.350
these various things,
none of those things have a lot of weight.
To me,

1874
01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:14.260
they're all very significant and important.
But if one of them went away,

1875
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:17.410
I'd be fine.
Like if the UFC calls me up today and said,
hey,

1876
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:20.860
you can't do the UFC anymore,
I'd be like,
well I had a great time.
Thanks guys.

1877
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:24.760
Appreciate it.
Take care.
And that would be the,
that would be fine with me.

1878
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:28.940
Like I've got enough other things that I do.
Diversified your portfolio.
Well,
if,

1879
01:52:28.941 --> 01:52:33.130
if it was my whole life,
it would be devastating.
But it's never your whole life.

1880
01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:37.900
Your life is your life.
And sometimes people forget that your life is your life.

1881
01:52:38.410 --> 01:52:42.610
It's this girl,
man,
if she leaves me,
I can't do it,
dude,
you can do it.

1882
01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:45.920
Trust me.
The only people who got dumped and moved on,

1883
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.000
<v 6>what,
you're the one person who can't do it.
You get the fuck Outta here,
bitch.</v>

1884
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:53.150
Just go find,
go to match.com.
I guarantee you,

1885
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:56.150
you're going to get laid in a month.
You're going to be so happy or free,

1886
01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:01.640
you know,
get on Tinder.
I mean he's like,
these are bad examples,
but swipe right,

1887
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:03.100
swipe right,
but,

1888
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:08.150
but involve yourself in more than one thing to versify your life.

1889
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:13.010
You can't,
if your life is completely revolving around one thing,

1890
01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:17.150
but then there's other places where that is a bad advice.
Like fighting.

1891
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:20.510
I think like I think you should have some few things that you do outside of

1892
01:53:20.511 --> 01:53:23.450
fighting,
but if you're going to engage in something like martial arts,

1893
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:27.310
like the amount of time that you have to do to compete there,

1894
01:53:27.311 --> 01:53:28.940
the amount of time that you have to dedicate to it,

1895
01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.630
it's almost impossible to have any other sort of life.

1896
01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.640
I think one of the key things is there's the development of skills,

1897
01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:38.000
which is important to diversify,
but you're really developing your identity.

1898
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:41.240
And if your sole identity is as a fighter,

1899
01:53:41.241 --> 01:53:43.970
what happens when you break your arm or your shoes,
your shoe with,

1900
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:46.280
then all of a sudden you're in this huge depression.

1901
01:53:46.281 --> 01:53:49.550
But let's say you're a fighter and you're also part of your identity is,

1902
01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.670
you know,
maybe you're a family man and you're a good,
you know,
you have,
uh,

1903
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:55.850
you're a good father and that becomes part of your identity and you're a good

1904
01:53:55.851 --> 01:53:57.740
fighter and you're,
you know,

1905
01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:00.350
you'd like to write or you like to paint and then all of a sudden you have

1906
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:02.360
multiple things.
So if one thing leaves,

1907
01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:06.650
then you have many other parts that really make your life,
give it purpose,

1908
01:54:06.651 --> 01:54:10.820
given meaning.
And I think the problem can be inherent in any of these things.

1909
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:14.660
Like you see parents whose soul life is the parenthood process,

1910
01:54:14.661 --> 01:54:18.440
their identity is their kid's success,
their identity,
his father of so,

1911
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:22.820
so mother of so and so.
And so that becomes an issue as well.

1912
01:54:22.821 --> 01:54:26.690
So diversifying your identity to the point where yeah,

1913
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:31.310
all of these are just things,
but it's really you yourself,
that you're,

1914
01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:34.870
you know,
this being on this planet,
you know,

1915
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.940
that doesn't need attachment to actually anything at all.

1916
01:54:37.941 --> 01:54:40.850
They're just all parts of your life.
Things that you enjoy,
you know,

1917
01:54:40.851 --> 01:54:45.770
that's the state of invulnerability where they can take away any one thing.

1918
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.040
Even your own physical,
like physical ability.

1919
01:54:49.041 --> 01:54:51.350
It's something that's very good to cultivate them all about it.

1920
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:55.880
But if you have your sole identity wrapped up in that and you get in some kind

1921
01:54:55.881 --> 01:54:59.030
of accident,
you know you're going to have a fucking hell of a time.

1922
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:02.540
Because if all you look at yourself is your physical ability and you haven't

1923
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:03.710
cultivated anything else,

1924
01:55:03.711 --> 01:55:08.120
your spiritual ability or your emotional connection to other people or these

1925
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:11.270
other things,
it's you putting all your eggs in one basket.

1926
01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:16.070
It's a dangerous place to be because the universe loves to go around and play.

1927
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:19.070
Gotcha.
On any type of thing that we have too much attachment to.

1928
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.270
It's crazy how that's such a catch 22 it's like in order to achieve great

1929
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:27.470
success,
you have to,
it has to literally become your world.

1930
01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:29.030
You have to be obsessed with it.

1931
01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:32.270
You have to like everything that I've ever done that I've got really good at,

1932
01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.100
I became completely obsessed with it.
[inaudible] it was living,

1933
01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.050
eating and breathing it.
Like I had no identity other than that.

1934
01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:43.920
But that doesn't bounce you out as a human being.
It's almost like you're,

1935
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.750
<v 0>you go through the sprints and then you know when you get out of the spring like</v>

1936
01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:51.030
I'm going to stop here for a second.
I can't keep doing this anymore.

1937
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:52.230
And then you know,

1938
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.070
you almost have to get through that in order to realize that there does need to

1939
01:55:56.071 --> 01:55:58.650
be some sort of diversification and your interests.

1940
01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:01.830
Miyamoto Musashi wrote about that and the book of five rings.

1941
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.480
One of the things that he,

1942
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:08.040
he talked about that was really important was that a great fighter,

1943
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:11.280
a Great Samurai,
had to also be a great philosopher,

1944
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:13.020
had to also be a great artist,

1945
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:17.700
had also like there was a balance that had to be achieved where there was never

1946
01:56:17.701 --> 01:56:22.680
any eh,
ridiculous anger.
There was no outburst,
no stupidity,

1947
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.010
there's no foolhardiness and this was all balanced.

1948
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.810
There was this symbiotic relationship that you had to all of your emotions and

1949
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:34.710
all of your fears and all of your ideas and all of your expression and your art

1950
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:39.750
was also you're killing and all of those things move together and that without

1951
01:56:39.751 --> 01:56:43.860
that balance you,
you would miss.
Something would go wrong.

1952
01:56:43.861 --> 01:56:47.400
You would fail to see it in front of you.
You would fail to Perry,

1953
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:50.340
you'd fail to counter and you would die on the battlefield.

1954
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:53.040
If your identity is too wrapped up in one thing,

1955
01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:57.210
you will crave the success in a way in which you need it because you need that

1956
01:56:57.211 --> 01:56:58.710
to support you in that.

1957
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:01.350
And the second that you need something or crave something,

1958
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:05.040
it belies a certain underlying fear that you're not going to get that.

1959
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:07.470
And the minute you have fear that you're not going to get it,

1960
01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:11.190
you're not going to be performing at your best ability.
You know?
So,
you know,

1961
01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:15.030
I heard a great poker player who told me that his mentor who had won some world

1962
01:57:15.031 --> 01:57:16.500
series of poker said,
you know,

1963
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:19.590
you'll win the world series of poker when it isn't a big deal if you win the

1964
01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:20.460
world series of poker.

1965
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.760
Like you've just gotten to the point where you've mastered that art to such a

1966
01:57:26.251 --> 01:57:29.130
degree that you don't crave that to,
to form your identity.

1967
01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:32.940
You're not afraid of not getting that.
It's just like,
yeah,
this is what I do.

1968
01:57:32.941 --> 01:57:35.640
I'm one of the best in the world and this is what's going to happen.

1969
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:38.070
You know when,
when it's,
yeah,
you can be stoked,

1970
01:57:38.071 --> 01:57:41.310
but it's not this deep need because anytime you need something,

1971
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:44.130
whether it's a girlfriend,
whether it's something in your career,

1972
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.710
you really need it to the point where if you don't get it,

1973
01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:47.850
you think you're going to freak out.

1974
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.490
You're going to be too afraid to actually get it.
I mean,

1975
01:57:50.491 --> 01:57:54.270
this is also that very important transition for when you actually do achieve

1976
01:57:54.271 --> 01:57:56.090
that thing.
Now what?
Right.

1977
01:57:56.610 --> 01:57:59.640
Look at a guy like Mike Tyson in his prime.

1978
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:03.930
I mean he was the epitome of dedication.

1979
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:04.891
You know,

1980
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:09.660
I remember watching this video of Mike Tyson describing his early morning runs

1981
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:12.030
that he could wake up later and Ron,

1982
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:15.750
but he got a little bit of an edge knowing that as he was running his opponent

1983
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:18.960
was sleeping,
you know,
and that he would work out.
I mean,

1984
01:58:18.961 --> 01:58:22.860
he was an impeccable condition when he was being trained by custom model.
He was,

1985
01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:27.600
he was living the complete total existence of a man.

1986
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:29.640
Hell bent on becoming the world champion.

1987
01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:31.680
And then once it became the world champion,

1988
01:58:31.681 --> 01:58:36.300
then he's buying tigers and smacking bitches and punching people in Bodega is,

1989
01:58:36.301 --> 01:58:37.830
and you just out of his fucking mind,
right?

1990
01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:42.040
Because he'd achieved this unstoppable,
this,
this,

1991
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.870
<v 4>this,
this status,
this,</v>

1992
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:47.320
this peak of existence that he had belonged for forever.

1993
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:50.520
But then where are the goals now?
What every,

1994
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.430
every fight is a 32nd assault.
You know,
I mean those,
those,

1995
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:58.960
those eighties fights with Tyson where he would just show up and look at people

1996
01:58:58.961 --> 01:59:01.440
and they would melt the Bruce Seldon fights where,
you know,

1997
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:06.100
he got dropped from a left hook,
didn't even connect like just the ghost.

1998
01:59:06.101 --> 01:59:09.850
It was like,
she,
like
when you,

1999
01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:14.360
I think there's a lack of a challenge,
then there's a lack of a goal.

2000
01:59:14.361 --> 01:59:19.030
There's no more mountain.
So now it's just chaos and cocaine and women and,
and,

2001
01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:23.470
and then eventually the wheels fall off.
The lack of balance.

2002
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.470
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean that's the,
you know,</v>

2003
01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:28.710
that is the warrior poet concept that we lost somewhere along the way.

2004
01:59:28.711 --> 01:59:32.220
We started celebrating it.
People in the extremes,
you know,
and,

2005
01:59:32.221 --> 01:59:36.080
and you celebrate that with extreme amount of money to,
you know,

2006
01:59:36.081 --> 01:59:38.190
in which is the allure,
like a laser.

2007
01:59:38.191 --> 01:59:41.970
Someone who can be really good at one thing can achieve a lot of financial

2008
01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:45.090
success,
but they're not generally going to achieve happiness.

2009
01:59:45.091 --> 01:59:47.820
But that's not what's celebrated or measured,
you know?

2010
01:59:47.821 --> 01:59:50.610
But that used to be the norm.
You know,
I think I've talked about it on,

2011
01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:55.940
on here before like that in ancient Greece and Rome in ancient Japan.

2012
01:59:56.581 --> 01:59:58.650
And this idea of the Bushido in this,

2013
01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:01.650
this way of cultivating many different skills and talents,

2014
02:00:01.651 --> 02:00:06.120
calligraphy along with swordsmanship philosophy along with holding the shield

2015
02:00:06.121 --> 02:00:07.140
line,
you know,

2016
02:00:07.141 --> 02:00:11.190
all of these different things that's been kind of lost a little bit along the

2017
02:00:11.191 --> 02:00:11.460
way.

2018
02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:16.460
And I think that's a huge part of bringing back and embrace of what it is to be

2019
02:00:16.770 --> 02:00:21.570
a man and for,
for women,
you know,
what it is to be a woman holding their own,

2020
02:00:21.670 --> 02:00:25.620
you know,
special magic in whatever field it is.
Not just attractiveness,

2021
02:00:25.621 --> 02:00:28.140
not just how good you look,
not just how sexy you are,

2022
02:00:28.141 --> 02:00:30.720
but what other things that you can cultivate.
You know,

2023
02:00:30.721 --> 02:00:33.540
what emotional intelligence,
what other skills,

2024
02:00:33.541 --> 02:00:35.580
maybe it is on the more masculine side,
whatever.

2025
02:00:35.581 --> 02:00:40.581
But rounding out the spectrum of everybody I think will really yield much,

2026
02:00:41.341 --> 02:00:43.740
much more positive results because again,
going back to this,

2027
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:48.450
these tragedies you see with bullying and all the suicides so much as attached

2028
02:00:48.451 --> 02:00:53.451
to their identity is attached to attractiveness and social status on these,

2029
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.450
on these networks where if they were a great poet or a great painter,

2030
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:00.930
a great basketball player,
a great soccer player,
you know,

2031
02:01:00.931 --> 02:01:04.890
there would be one element of truth that they could always rely on even when the

2032
02:01:04.891 --> 02:01:08.190
world seemed to take away that,
and let's say they were good at multiple things.

2033
02:01:08.191 --> 02:01:11.730
Let's say they were good at caring for an animal and good at and good at soccer

2034
02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:15.060
and good at,
you know,
writing and they were attractive.
All right,

2035
02:01:15.061 --> 02:01:17.700
will you take away that one finger of attractiveness?
Cool.

2036
02:01:17.701 --> 02:01:21.720
They still got these multiple areas,
so I think that's a key thing.
You know,

2037
02:01:21.721 --> 02:01:26.550
if you look at developmentally ideas to instill in young people is having

2038
02:01:26.551 --> 02:01:29.880
multiple things that they can draw steam from when everything looks like it's

2039
02:01:29.881 --> 02:01:32.640
collapsing and say,
ah,
I can sort it out.
You know?

2040
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:37.750
<v 4>I think counterintuitively also the idea that bullying is just a natural part</v>

2041
02:01:38.751 --> 02:01:40.130
of,
of people growing up.

2042
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.130
I think it's a natural part of people growing up that never learned how to
fight.

2043
02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:43.881
You know,

2044
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:47.600
where you see very little bullying or very little tolerance of bullying martial

2045
02:01:47.601 --> 02:01:50.210
arts schools.
It is very,

2046
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.890
it is looked at as one of the worst character traits,

2047
02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:58.220
a true martial artists.
A true master can have.
You know,

2048
02:01:58.221 --> 02:02:02.300
like one of the easiest things you could do,
like say if you want to do Jujitsu,

2049
02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:04.940
if you want to roll with a guy like Marcello Garcia,
you're,

2050
02:02:04.941 --> 02:02:07.430
you're not going to get hurt.
You're just not gonna.
He's not gonna hurt you.

2051
02:02:07.610 --> 02:02:10.700
He'll tap you.
You will be forced into positions we have to tap out.

2052
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.350
But that's not hurting you.
That's,
he's going to beat you at the game of Jujitsu.

2053
02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:18.470
But as far as like harm you,
he's not going to harm you.

2054
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:22.130
And as far as the way he treats you,
he's the kindest,
sweetest guy ever.

2055
02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:26.720
And one of the reasons why is because he is a true master at killing people with

2056
02:02:26.721 --> 02:02:30.860
his bare hands,
without actually harming people.
It seems contradictory.

2057
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:35.720
I think the best way to stop bullying in school would be to make martial arts

2058
02:02:35.721 --> 02:02:38.010
available to everyone and to,

2059
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:41.000
to explain to them this isn't about becoming a tough guy.

2060
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:45.920
It's about overcoming your own self,
overcoming your own insecurities,

2061
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:49.100
your own ego,
which is a battle that is constant.

2062
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:52.310
It's like is that expression about,
um,

2063
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:57.500
there's an expression about inspiration is a,
that inspiration is like bathing.

2064
02:02:57.870 --> 02:03:00.590
Uh,
it works but it works for short periods of time.

2065
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:03.080
That's why we recommend it daily.
You know,

2066
02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:05.090
like you can't just base once a year and go,

2067
02:03:05.091 --> 02:03:08.470
what the fuck a dude booth when my dirty,
you know,

2068
02:03:08.490 --> 02:03:13.450
I mean it's the same thing with developing your mind,
controlling your ego,
um,

2069
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:16.370
uh,
controlling your fears,

2070
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:21.510
Re re reassuring your anxieties and assessing the objective view or assessing an

2071
02:03:22.911 --> 02:03:26.630
objective view of,
of your life and your,
your,
your perspective on the world.

2072
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.620
And I think it's very difficult to do without some discipline,

2073
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:35.570
without some sort of task oriented discipline.
And in my opinion,

2074
02:03:35.571 --> 02:03:37.940
one of the best ones is martial arts.

2075
02:03:38.150 --> 02:03:42.410
And it's one of the best ones for dealing with interpersonal conflict because we

2076
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:45.260
want to pretend that no one's going to fight.
We want to like,

2077
02:03:45.261 --> 02:03:47.390
well we don't want bullying,
we don't want fighting.

2078
02:03:47.391 --> 02:03:50.390
We don't want that in this school.
Well you have it.
Okay,

2079
02:03:50.391 --> 02:03:52.790
you have it and you don't why you have it.
One of the reasons why have it,

2080
02:03:52.791 --> 02:03:57.260
you're not addressing the underlying problems.
So what it means to be a person,

2081
02:03:57.410 --> 02:04:01.940
especially what it means to be a developing man growing up and having all these

2082
02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:06.830
thousands of years of instincts and DNA ingrained in your,

2083
02:04:06.831 --> 02:04:11.330
your,
your biological system.
And then you're supposed to just ignore them.

2084
02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:16.040
And you wonder why men gravitate towards to toxic masculinity,
like,

2085
02:04:16.041 --> 02:04:19.800
you know,
video games and,
and fucking watching the Avengers they,

2086
02:04:19.810 --> 02:04:24.050
so it's not toxic.
It's a part of being a human,
like a part of being a human.

2087
02:04:24.051 --> 02:04:29.051
The reason why we got here in 2015 it's not because everybody did yoga and a

2088
02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:33.590
Tofu.
It's because there were fucking warriors and they fought off other warriors

2089
02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.310
because we used to be rampaging tribes of people.
Okay.

2090
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:41.820
<v 6>And we evolve past that over millions of years to get to where we are now.</v>

2091
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:46.080
But it's foolish to pretend that we're done.
It's fucking foolish.

2092
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.850
It's foolish to,
but why not?
So Harry,
what is that?

2093
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.230
That's monkey DNA,
man.
I'm still fucking animal.

2094
02:04:55.231 --> 02:04:56.580
There's animal in us.

2095
02:04:56.730 --> 02:05:00.360
We're not these aliens with these large gray heads and,

2096
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:03.660
and like frail bodies and we move things around with telepathy.

2097
02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:06.180
Maybe that's in our future,
we're not there yet.

2098
02:05:06.181 --> 02:05:11.181
And to pretend that we're there now is ignoring our biological system and that's

2099
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:16.200
ensuring they're going to have these same issues over and over and over again.

2100
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:19.440
I think that some of the nicest people I've ever met have been martial artists,

2101
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:24.590
and I really believe that if we taught that in school from the time when

2102
02:05:24.781 --> 02:05:25.620
children were little,

2103
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:29.820
so it's not some scary freaky thing that you have to enter into as an adult,

2104
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:34.500
but it's a part of a normal everyday management of life program.

2105
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.740
I think we would be a lot better off,
a lot better off.

2106
02:05:37.741 --> 02:05:41.250
He would alleviate a lot of that anxiety of physical altercation to,

2107
02:05:41.251 --> 02:05:44.650
it wouldn't be some threat that everybody's holding over everybody's head to,

2108
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:48.000
you know,
it'd be much easier existence,
I think.

2109
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:52.020
I think you make a perfect point there because it's not in d anytime he tried to

2110
02:05:52.021 --> 02:05:56.310
deny these natural instincts that you have,
you're going to have a problem.
So,

2111
02:05:56.350 --> 02:05:59.580
and then the other aspect is,
okay,
let's placate them.
All right,

2112
02:05:59.581 --> 02:06:01.470
well that kind of works a little bit,

2113
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:05.580
but really what we should do is celebrate them and allow them to channel in

2114
02:06:05.581 --> 02:06:07.020
positive ways.
You know,

2115
02:06:07.021 --> 02:06:11.690
celebrate that urge to use your body in these strong physical,
you know,

2116
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:15.060
forums and martial arts is a great way to channel that Jujitsu,

2117
02:06:15.061 --> 02:06:20.061
particularly because with Jujitsu you can go 100% against somebody and not

2118
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:24.000
typically not hurt them.
You know,
it's this real contest.

2119
02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:27.810
Wrestling was a way that a lot of people did that for thousands of years as
well.

2120
02:06:27.811 --> 02:06:30.330
Developing different wrestling styles.
You'll see it in Africa,

2121
02:06:30.331 --> 02:06:33.090
that Greco Roman style sumo,
whatever.

2122
02:06:33.091 --> 02:06:37.950
It's a way that people can exert force upon each other safely and celebrate the

2123
02:06:37.951 --> 02:06:38.880
art form of that.

2124
02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.940
Same with sexuality and I think there's a huge problem with that.

2125
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:46.410
People just deny the fact that we're sexual beings and we better not teach sex

2126
02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:49.500
ed or the kids might have sex.
What the fuck are you talking about?

2127
02:06:50.730 --> 02:06:53.580
Countries and cultures where they teach sex ed younger,

2128
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.640
they have lower teen pregnancy rates,
right?

2129
02:06:56.641 --> 02:07:01.641
And they have actually more pro social sexual engagements because people are

2130
02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.513
talking about it.

2131
02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:06.720
She could say the same thing about the psychedelic experience like the island,

2132
02:07:06.721 --> 02:07:09.480
which is a crowd favorite of ours by Aldous Huxley.

2133
02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:13.950
He talks about the rights of passage ceremonies.
That includes Moke,
Hsa medicine,

2134
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:19.310
which is probably siliciden that is done in the group setting for kids as a

2135
02:07:19.771 --> 02:07:24.771
rights of passage to going into their adulthood that supported and stewarded by

2136
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.020
those that have already gone through it.
So like your Dojo master,

2137
02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:33.560
working with people in the early stages of martial arts training or somebody

2138
02:07:33.751 --> 02:07:38.700
that's medicine positive and experienced working with kids going into

2139
02:07:38.710 --> 02:07:43.270
psychedelic altered states of consciousness to be able to expand their

2140
02:07:43.271 --> 02:07:45.550
worldview.
So all these things were,

2141
02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:49.990
were we repressed information,
sexuality,

2142
02:07:49.991 --> 02:07:53.080
angiogenics,
physical engagement.

2143
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:56.860
Anytime we were oppressing those things,
they're going to come out anyway.

2144
02:07:56.950 --> 02:08:01.660
And they usually come out in these distorted destructive ways.
Yeah,

2145
02:08:01.661 --> 02:08:06.250
so set the bar with really good practices and all of these areas,
sexuality,

2146
02:08:06.251 --> 02:08:10.510
physicality and spirituality.
Like,
really,
if you're nurturing somebody young,

2147
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:15.070
you got to hit those areas in a really conscious way and not be scared of him.

2148
02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:18.730
That's,
that is what we are.
Like you said,
we got fucking hair on our bodies.

2149
02:08:18.731 --> 02:08:22.510
Like let's enjoy that.
It's not going to last forever.
It's a cool time.

2150
02:08:22.511 --> 02:08:26.860
Let's really enjoy this period.
Whatever comes next comes next.

2151
02:08:26.861 --> 02:08:30.040
But celebrate that in a positive way.
You know,
teach kids,

2152
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:33.790
not just this is what to do.
Always wear a condom,
blah,
blah,
blah,
all of that.

2153
02:08:33.791 --> 02:08:35.050
But it'd be like,
all right,

2154
02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:39.490
this is what to do if you think you're about to come and you really should,

2155
02:08:39.491 --> 02:08:42.310
would rather hold off a little longer.
Like,
you know,

2156
02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:43.840
not just think about baseball,

2157
02:08:43.841 --> 02:08:46.090
but there's like tantric practices that can help you,

2158
02:08:46.091 --> 02:08:49.840
like different breathing techniques.
I can put that like actionable information.

2159
02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:51.430
So kids are like,
okay,

2160
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:54.400
I can calm down a little bit in this situation and maybe this can be,

2161
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:58.990
instead of this short,
violent experience that leaves everybody feeling like,
ah,

2162
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:00.040
what was that?
You know,

2163
02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:02.860
teach them how to make it a positive experience so they don't get all this

2164
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:06.400
baggage attached to these sexual encounters.
Cause I've,

2165
02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:07.630
I've encountered that a lot.

2166
02:09:07.631 --> 02:09:12.631
People who've had really caustic and damaging sexual encounters with people

2167
02:09:12.791 --> 02:09:14.980
where it's like so much tension built up,

2168
02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:19.390
so much ignorance around it and then something happens and it's just short and

2169
02:09:19.391 --> 02:09:21.340
violent and it's terrible.
It's like Ah,

2170
02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:25.330
that was an awful traumatic experience where you could just be like,
look,

2171
02:09:25.331 --> 02:09:28.120
we're all going to have sex.
It's cool.
Here's some techniques.

2172
02:09:28.121 --> 02:09:31.150
This is what's pleasurable.
This is what's respectful,
this is what safe.

2173
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:34.300
These are some techniques that can help out and celebrate that.

2174
02:09:34.301 --> 02:09:36.010
Just the same as you would teach martial arts.

2175
02:09:36.011 --> 02:09:40.510
Just the same as you would steward people through true experiential spirituality

2176
02:09:40.511 --> 02:09:44.260
where they get in touch with that other thing either inside themselves or in the

2177
02:09:44.261 --> 02:09:47.620
other,
you know,
astral in the,
in the light world,
whatever you want to say,

2178
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:48.131
you know,

2179
02:09:48.131 --> 02:09:52.240
steward them in positive ways through those main categories and it's a different

2180
02:09:52.241 --> 02:09:53.290
fucking world at that point.

2181
02:09:53.590 --> 02:09:58.590
There's also a lot of confusing and conflicting signals that are out there.

2182
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:03.130
People expressing themselves in ways that aren't necessarily honest,

2183
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:08.430
but in instead they're trying to calm their own anxieties or distort the,

2184
02:10:11.751 --> 02:10:14.770
distort other people's perceptions of reality to,

2185
02:10:14.771 --> 02:10:17.650
to match up with the way they identify themselves.

2186
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.420
And when you see this all the time with a homophobic people who will talk very

2187
02:10:22.421 --> 02:10:25.960
horribly about gay sex,
and then you find out that they're actually gay,

2188
02:10:26.230 --> 02:10:30.790
I mean this is,
it's,
it's so common like this mixed signal,
this wire,

2189
02:10:31.090 --> 02:10:34.340
this confusion going on.
People that uh,
don't

2190
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:37.940
<v 4>feel sexually attractive,
don't feel awkward or feel awkward rather,</v>

2191
02:10:37.941 --> 02:10:39.360
and don't feel like they're there.

2192
02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:43.460
They want to diffuse or deny or,

2193
02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:48.700
or demean the idea of the importance of sexual contact.

2194
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:53.600
Like I read this piece the other day where someone was saying that there is no

2195
02:10:53.601 --> 02:10:57.530
such thing as the urge for sex.
I,
there is,
there's no set,

2196
02:10:57.590 --> 02:11:00.020
there's no sex drive.
She actually said this.

2197
02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:03.590
They were saying there is no sex drive.
There's a drive to eat,

2198
02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:06.860
there's a drive to salute.
You have dropped.
But if you don't have sex,

2199
02:11:06.861 --> 02:11:09.560
you are fine and I'm like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

2200
02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:10.490
Like what are you talking about?

2201
02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:13.010
How do you think they've got to be 7 billion people in the world?

2202
02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.670
We all just decided to fuck.
Let me just slow.
Let's try this.
No,

2203
02:11:16.671 --> 02:11:18.710
there's a god damn crazy drive.

2204
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:23.770
There's numerous examples through every species of people risking their animals,

2205
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:27.260
risking their life to have sex.
Sure.
You know,
why do these,

2206
02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:28.430
why do these animals in the wild?

2207
02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:32.770
Why do they fight to the death for like the seventh cow in the Harem or like,

2208
02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.810
like you don't do that because you're just trying to survive.

2209
02:11:35.811 --> 02:11:37.910
It's because there's an instinct to reproduce.

2210
02:11:37.911 --> 02:11:42.410
It's probably as strong as the instinct to survive and in some cases superseding

2211
02:11:42.411 --> 02:11:43.850
it.
How about elk?

2212
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:48.910
They grow trees out of their fucking head so they could smash these trees and to

2213
02:11:49.251 --> 02:11:53.750
other elk.
They stab each other.
These trees have pointy ends.

2214
02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:57.170
They don't grow blunt.
They have fucking points on the end.

2215
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:58.730
And if you ever seen elk fight,

2216
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.350
they have holes all over their chest and their cape all over their neck area

2217
02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.180
where they jam their fucking,

2218
02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:09.740
these swords that grow every year at their head.
When it's time to fuck,

2219
02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:10.760
when it's time,

2220
02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.680
their urge is so strong that their body grows swords out of their fucking head.

2221
02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:19.730
And then when they're done fucking they drop off,
they fall off.
I mean,

2222
02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:23.660
it's insane to think that there's not a sex drive.
It's insane.

2223
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:28.930
But this was a whole article by some chubby dummy that has shitty hormone

2224
02:12:29.181 --> 02:12:31.850
balance,
never goes jogging,
I'm sure,

2225
02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:36.020
and just feels completely unattractive sexually.

2226
02:12:36.110 --> 02:12:40.730
So they're in denial about the urge and the need and whether or not it's a core

2227
02:12:40.731 --> 02:12:45.350
component of life because it's so waited because he use sex to sell Jaguars and

2228
02:12:45.351 --> 02:12:47.840
lipstick and fucking buildings and you know,

2229
02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:50.600
there's always a woman with her legs and long land,

2230
02:12:50.601 --> 02:12:54.710
a man with abs and a fucking Calvin Klein commercial and all this sex,
sex,
sex,

2231
02:12:54.711 --> 02:12:58.550
sex,
sex.
You know,
there's people that just feel like I'm out of that game.

2232
02:12:58.750 --> 02:13:02.890
Like that game does not apply to me.
I'm here eating donuts.
My,
my,
my,

2233
02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.370
my gut looks like a fucking beanbag chair and I'm not that guy or I'm not that

2234
02:13:07.371 --> 02:13:11.510
girl.
And so they deny the existence of it.
And if you,
uh,

2235
02:13:11.511 --> 02:13:14.540
if you show a picture of yourself looking hot,
you're fat shaming,

2236
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:19.580
which is one of my all time favorite of all the retarded social justice warrior

2237
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.950
sayings,
fat shaming,
like can't shame you if you're not fat.
How about that?
Well,

2238
02:13:24.951 --> 02:13:27.020
the repression creates these other things.

2239
02:13:27.021 --> 02:13:31.170
Like the reason why Americans use sex to sell everything is because sex has been

2240
02:13:31.171 --> 02:13:32.160
so repressed

2241
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.430
<v 0>that we,
and yes,
we crave it in some crazy,
weird way.</v>

2242
02:13:35.431 --> 02:13:38.610
If it was just a healthy relationship with it,
it would be like,

2243
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:41.920
why is the really hot girls selling a cheeseburger?
Right.

2244
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:46.800
It'd be funny and people would laugh at it instead of being like all Paris

2245
02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:50.040
Hilton was sauce dripping down her face.
It was amazing.
You know,

2246
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:53.580
way less effective for people to get laid all the time.
Yeah,
for sure.

2247
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:57.840
When people are married and their wives kind of dumpy and they're kind of dumpy

2248
02:13:57.841 --> 02:14:00.720
and they just,
no one ever touches them and no one's attracted them.

2249
02:14:00.721 --> 02:14:04.950
And then they see some chick with dark red lipstick on and our breasts are

2250
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:09.660
plumped up and she's in some fucking outfit and she's selling Burger King or

2251
02:14:09.661 --> 02:14:13.080
something like that.
I like,
oh boy.
You like what?

2252
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:18.090
It just draws you to it because it's unavailable because it's,
it's,

2253
02:14:18.091 --> 02:14:23.091
it's just outside of the realm of possibility and your meager existence so they

2254
02:14:23.191 --> 02:14:24.090
can,
it's,

2255
02:14:24.091 --> 02:14:28.080
it becomes currency becomes like a huge selling point and you look at the amount

2256
02:14:28.081 --> 02:14:31.440
of things that we sell with beautiful women.
I mean,

2257
02:14:31.441 --> 02:14:36.180
it's staggering if you just did a montage of all the different things that we

2258
02:14:36.181 --> 02:14:40.920
try to sell with beautiful scantily clad women.
It's amazing.
I mean,

2259
02:14:40.921 --> 02:14:45.450
it's amazing.
It's,
it's a really crazy,

2260
02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:50.250
yeah.
I mean in a healthy relationship I suppose it would be like,
you know,
you,

2261
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:52.530
it's not to not celebrate beautiful women.

2262
02:14:52.531 --> 02:14:56.130
Beautiful women are inherently going to be something that people are going to

2263
02:14:56.131 --> 02:14:59.160
enjoy seeing.
Just like a great,
beautiful bouquet of flowers.

2264
02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:01.980
Like you have a beautiful bouquet of flowers on your table.

2265
02:15:02.110 --> 02:15:04.590
You know you're going to look at that and you're going to say,
Oh man,

2266
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:06.930
that's beautiful.
That's a beautiful part of the world.

2267
02:15:07.170 --> 02:15:10.290
That's a beautiful part of nature that exists and you can appreciate it,

2268
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:15.500
but not using that to manipulate and in some weird way and cause a reaction and

2269
02:15:15.751 --> 02:15:19.050
then use that momentum and steer it and turn it.
You know?

2270
02:15:19.051 --> 02:15:21.600
That's where it gets weird.
But I think all the,
you know,

2271
02:15:21.710 --> 02:15:24.750
all too often people forget that other part,
which is,
yeah,

2272
02:15:24.751 --> 02:15:26.550
that is a beautiful part of the world.
It's,

2273
02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:29.280
it's beautiful to look at it be beautiful to smell.

2274
02:15:29.281 --> 02:15:33.300
It'd be beautiful in a variety of different ways.
We can fully celebrate that,

2275
02:15:33.301 --> 02:15:37.410
but just not manipulate that urge into something that's not helpful.

2276
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:40.710
But it's one of those weird things where when things are suppressed,

2277
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:45.600
they gain so much energy and so much power that are almost unavoidable.

2278
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:46.760
I mean this,
this,
this,
this,

2279
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
this momentum and energy behind them that it like the Catholic priest that is

2280
02:15:53.281 --> 02:15:57.720
forced into celibacy and now nobody trusts that fuck cause he's just this,

2281
02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.230
this just barely hanging on,
clinging,

2282
02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:04.890
clinging like a piece of cheesecloth,
holding back the ocean,

2283
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:11.160
you know,
just,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
it's not natural.
You know,

2284
02:16:11.161 --> 02:16:13.470
it's not normal.
And that's why the,

2285
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:18.360
the image or the depiction of the Catholic priests as being some sex crazed,

2286
02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:22.740
pervert,
pedophile,
why it exists,
it's completely,

2287
02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:25.710
totally unnatural to repress yourself sexually.

2288
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:28.500
It has nothing to do with homosexuality.
Like people will say,

2289
02:16:28.501 --> 02:16:30.190
low Catholic priests are all really gay

2290
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:31.210
<v 4>and that's why they go into priesthood.</v>

2291
02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:35.710
Get Gay and molesting kids are completely unrelated,
right?

2292
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:37.140
That is not what's going on.
What did,

2293
02:16:37.141 --> 02:16:42.141
what's going on is these poor fucking people have no sexual outlet.

2294
02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:44.530
And that is totally unnatural.

2295
02:16:44.531 --> 02:16:48.970
It is the epitome of denying your physical existence is exactly what we're

2296
02:16:48.971 --> 02:16:52.100
talking about earlier.
The denial of the,
the uh,

2297
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:57.180
the body as a biological organism that has existed for untold thousands of years

2298
02:16:59.501 --> 02:17:02.140
in the exact same state that you find yourself in today.

2299
02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:07.150
And that existence is predicated on the need to breed sexual desire.

2300
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:11.560
And the fact that you're buying is making fucking sperm every day of the week.

2301
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:15.550
Okay?
It's just constantly doing it because it doesn't know that you're a priest.

2302
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:18.780
You know,
your body just thinks it's a body.
You know,
you,

2303
02:17:18.781 --> 02:17:23.781
you have to exist as a human being under the confines of being a human being.

2304
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:29.140
When you deny your humanity because it doesn't fit your idea or your aesthetic

2305
02:17:29.141 --> 02:17:33.880
or your,
your,
your ridiculous notions of what you should be.
Well,

2306
02:17:33.881 --> 02:17:37.540
you're going to run into problem son.
I mean that's the,
you,
you,
you,
you,

2307
02:17:37.690 --> 02:17:42.160
we should all aspire to greater heights.
But in doing so,

2308
02:17:42.161 --> 02:17:46.000
you've got to address the reality of what the fuck you are.
That's again,

2309
02:17:46.001 --> 02:17:49.690
going back to the definition of consciousness.
Consciousness is fully embodied.

2310
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.441
You know,

2311
02:17:50.441 --> 02:17:54.550
it is not just sitting on a mountain only accessing your spiritual body.

2312
02:17:54.551 --> 02:17:55.600
It's fully embodied.

2313
02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:59.650
It's being a human in your body and bringing that home and bringing in the,

2314
02:18:00.130 --> 02:18:03.900
the unity of that whole system together.
That's,
you know,
that's what,

2315
02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:07.270
what it really boils down to.
That's what's going to lead the happiest,

2316
02:18:07.271 --> 02:18:08.230
most fulfilled life.

2317
02:18:08.231 --> 02:18:13.231
And make you someone who society can lean on like an anchor that creates these

2318
02:18:13.271 --> 02:18:15.550
people that are just the pillars,
the leaders,

2319
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:20.010
the people who can be there when the shit hits the fan.
You know,
I mean,
that's,

2320
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:24.160
that's who everybody should aspire to be.
An embodied being of consciousness,

2321
02:18:24.161 --> 02:18:27.040
not just a consciousness being and not just a body.

2322
02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:31.270
Bring it all together and there should be a bunch of us around.
So it's normal.

2323
02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:32.800
I mean,
I would say us,
like we've got it nailed,

2324
02:18:32.801 --> 02:18:36.760
but I mean a bunch of humans that are like that around so that we could all sort

2325
02:18:36.761 --> 02:18:39.940
of feed off of each other and imitate our atmosphere in a very positive way.

2326
02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:42.100
And I think,
um,
you know,

2327
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.060
there's a lot of people running through life that they don't have anyone around

2328
02:18:46.061 --> 02:18:49.870
them,
that,
that is living a life that they would aspire to.

2329
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:51.940
And so it's really hard to dream.

2330
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:57.130
It's really hard to picture an ideal existence because your existence is sort
of,

2331
02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:02.050
it's modeled out of what you see in your environment,

2332
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:06.340
your environment.
There's a lot of misery and bullshit and,

2333
02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.620
and just confusion and despair.
It's like that.
Um,

2334
02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:17.560
who was the,
who was the,
the great author that made that quote?
Was it Walden?

2335
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:21.400
I forget.
Thorough.
Thorough.
Uh,
all men leave.

2336
02:19:21.430 --> 02:19:26.020
Most men lead lives of silent desperation and that's the,

2337
02:19:26.021 --> 02:19:28.580
that's the realities.
Like most

2338
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.010
<v 0>people,
I mean he,
he's a man,
so he wrote about men,</v>

2339
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:34.460
but most people I think live lives of,

2340
02:19:34.461 --> 02:19:39.440
of longing for better silent desperation.
Just like,
this is it.
This is,

2341
02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:42.890
this is what I'm doing.
Well,
you get shot.
You know,

2342
02:19:42.891 --> 02:19:46.250
like you're in your cubicle and you just want to grab that,
that image,

2343
02:19:46.251 --> 02:19:49.430
that famous video of a guy who's in his cubicle,

2344
02:19:49.431 --> 02:19:53.630
he just starts punching his keyboard and then just smashes his computer monitor

2345
02:19:53.631 --> 02:19:56.930
and picks it up and smash it on the ground.
It was all caught by security camera.

2346
02:19:56.931 --> 02:19:58.010
Have you ever seen that video?

2347
02:19:58.250 --> 02:20:02.780
It embodies cubicle life to me because this guy just hit that point well like

2348
02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.280
fuck,
smashes the whole thing.
I mean,

2349
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:12.080
it's just so many people are like on that brink just right there.

2350
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:13.430
And so they numb themselves.

2351
02:20:13.431 --> 02:20:18.050
They numb themselves with alcohol or medicine x or television or all of these

2352
02:20:18.051 --> 02:20:19.850
things to damp in these and make it,

2353
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:23.630
make it possible instead of just really looking at what's the what,

2354
02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:27.110
let's go for the fucking win.
Like what's the win?
What's the situation?

2355
02:20:27.111 --> 02:20:31.210
Even if it's not normal,
even if it's a little weird,
even if it's on the fringe,

2356
02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:34.730
like what's the win for me?
Like,
fuck what everybody else thinks.
You know,

2357
02:20:34.731 --> 02:20:35.990
I'm going to forge a new way.

2358
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:41.090
Maybe that is being some crazy ice Fisher in some desolate place,

2359
02:20:41.091 --> 02:20:45.140
or maybe it's living in a nonmonogamous community or maybe whatever.

2360
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:50.090
Like what's your win?
Go for the win.
Like don't just accept,
Eh,
okay.
You know,

2361
02:20:50.091 --> 02:20:53.690
this was okay.
This,
this lifetime we did all right.
We made it through,
you know,

2362
02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:55.640
just go for the fucking win.
Yeah.

2363
02:20:55.641 --> 02:21:00.200
It's like hunters Thompson description of how to end life screeching sideways

2364
02:21:00.201 --> 02:21:01.340
with the wheels falling off.

2365
02:21:01.341 --> 02:21:06.341
Like don't pull in and park at the end of the life like you want your radiator

2366
02:21:06.801 --> 02:21:10.520
to be overheating,
engine smoking.
Everything fell apart.

2367
02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:14.720
You know,
I know this woman Sue Akins,
uh,

2368
02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.480
she's on that show life below zero shoes on the podcast.

2369
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:21.200
She's just fucking great,
great character.
She's in her fifties.

2370
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:25.230
She lives 200 miles above the arctic circle on a place called Kavach and a

2371
02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:30.050
Alaska and she loves it.
That's her.
That's her reality.
That's a reality for the,

2372
02:21:30.051 --> 02:21:34.640
when she went for the win and it's not my,
when it's not your win by win.
Exactly.

2373
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:38.330
So this is not your win,
but it's her when man,
she fucking loves it.

2374
02:21:38.331 --> 02:21:42.740
When she talks about it,
she talks about it with like true love.
Like she,

2375
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:46.580
she is enjoying it.
She loved that.
It fits her personality.

2376
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:49.430
It fits her worldview.
She loves it.

2377
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.810
She's in the midst of ongoing crowded therapy.
Yeah.
She had just these pretty,

2378
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:56.370
pretty young kids a week.
Cryotherapy though,
you know,

2379
02:21:56.420 --> 02:22:00.410
she's not really doing the 250 degrees below zero.
She only gets down to like 90,

2380
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.700
but she does it for way longer.
Sure.
So

2381
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:05.910
<v 5>it's different.
Yeah.</v>

2382
02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:11.160
What were some of when you were treating patients in the clinical pathology

2383
02:22:11.161 --> 02:22:15.530
thing,
like what were some of the,
the patterns that you saw that were,
you know,

2384
02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:19.350
really for some of the real challenges that people face,

2385
02:22:19.351 --> 02:22:23.340
like growing up,
you know,
like what were the main themes that were the hardest,

2386
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:25.980
hardest to deal with and bring into a healthy adult?

2387
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:28.920
<v 3>Why trauma and disconnection?</v>

2388
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:35.150
Disconnection from like what Joe was saying in regards to mentorship and having,

2389
02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:37.860
having a big brother or somebody in that role,

2390
02:22:37.890 --> 02:22:41.520
did they get aspire to be like that could coach them through challenging

2391
02:22:41.521 --> 02:22:46.521
situations and going through trauma because trauma is so rampant and it's also

2392
02:22:48.841 --> 02:22:52.530
our,
our representation and our internalization of trauma.

2393
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.230
Some people take that on as an identity,

2394
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.490
that they've been traumatized or they've been abused and,

2395
02:22:58.530 --> 02:23:03.120
and because it's not discussed,
it's in fact shamed.
Um,

2396
02:23:03.121 --> 02:23:07.560
it's not really dealt with above board whether it's people being traumatized

2397
02:23:07.561 --> 02:23:09.390
sexually because the,
the perpetrator,

2398
02:23:09.391 --> 02:23:12.600
the person actually doing the traumatic event,

2399
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:14.760
they weren't integrated in their own sexuality.

2400
02:23:14.761 --> 02:23:19.761
So it came out in a perverse way or it was the internalization of something that

2401
02:23:20.971 --> 02:23:25.971
seemed mild but because they didn't have the languaging and the opportunity to

2402
02:23:26.221 --> 02:23:30.390
connect with somebody that it,
it held and seated over time.

2403
02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:33.270
Like if you see animals in the wild,
when they get traumatized,

2404
02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:36.090
like if you were driving a car and you hit a deer,

2405
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:39.480
the first thing that deer is going to do when he gets to the side of the road,

2406
02:23:39.481 --> 02:23:40.560
it's going to shake it out.

2407
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:46.080
It's going to just move that somatically out of its body because trauma gets

2408
02:23:46.081 --> 02:23:49.580
imprinted into the sematic infrastructure like,
but on,

2409
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:52.800
he was talking about into like the Fascia trauma gets fat,

2410
02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:56.220
kids gets programmed into the body,
it also gets trauma.

2411
02:23:56.310 --> 02:23:58.890
We'll change the genetic expression.

2412
02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:04.080
You actually see the DNA genetic code change its expression at the time of

2413
02:24:04.081 --> 02:24:08.790
trauma.
And that can be recapitulated transgenerationally.

2414
02:24:09.450 --> 02:24:11.970
So from generation to generation to generation,

2415
02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:15.640
I can still hold my parents' trauma,
my grandparents,

2416
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:20.430
like an epigenetic phenomenon.
It's a transgenerational epigenetic phenomena.

2417
02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:25.110
Right?
So that's so crazy.
It's so crazy.
So we,
we are,

2418
02:24:25.111 --> 02:24:27.100
and that's what the native Americans talk about.
Like our,

2419
02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.200
our actions right now do affect seven generations down the line because it takes

2420
02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:34.860
that long to bleed it out of the jeans unless you clear it.

2421
02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:38.220
And so trauma has a big hold,

2422
02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.110
that sense of disconnection because we grew up in these disenfranchised
families.

2423
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:44.251
Like you know,

2424
02:24:44.251 --> 02:24:47.970
mom and dad drive in with little Johnny in the back and they hit the garage door

2425
02:24:47.971 --> 02:24:48.780
opener,

2426
02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:53.070
drive in garage door goes down like little Johnny's getting his social

2427
02:24:53.071 --> 02:24:57.600
engagement through computer games and through Twitter and Facebook and texting.

2428
02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:00.900
You see kids nowadays texting across from each other.

2429
02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:06.360
It's crazy as opposed to having this engagement.
They're texting,
not just kids,

2430
02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:09.070
grown adults.
I've,
I,

2431
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:12.600
I can't tell you how many times I've gone to dinner with friends that are in

2432
02:25:12.601 --> 02:25:16.410
their thirties and forties and five people at a table and everyone's staring at

2433
02:25:16.411 --> 02:25:20.250
their phone,
right?
Right.
So where's that sense of connection?

2434
02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:23.010
And that gets recapitulated and it build,

2435
02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:27.610
particularly because kids are little sponges and their social middle you is

2436
02:25:27.611 --> 02:25:30.820
really developing its foundation when they're really young that way.

2437
02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:33.070
So if it starts so young,

2438
02:25:33.071 --> 02:25:37.600
then it solidifies over time until there's a massive interjection of some new

2439
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:41.680
kind of thing.
And so it's important for kids to be absorbed in nature.

2440
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:43.850
It's important for them to have like the,

2441
02:25:43.851 --> 02:25:47.560
the correct mentioned mentorship about not shaming,
not blaming,

2442
02:25:47.561 --> 02:25:51.700
bringing everything up to the surface.
And then the whole way that we work with,

2443
02:25:51.701 --> 02:25:53.320
for example,
like the penal system,

2444
02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:57.850
the whole judicial system is completely backwards.
We,

2445
02:25:58.030 --> 02:26:02.560
we labeled the perpetrator and the victim and then the whole legal system is set

2446
02:26:02.561 --> 02:26:06.280
up against that way.
It's right.
That's like warring.
It's not about like,
um,

2447
02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:11.140
uh,
it's not about a cooperative model.

2448
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:16.450
It's not about healing the Vick,
the,
the perpetrator.

2449
02:26:16.451 --> 02:26:20.080
It's about rescuing the victims so people in that victim mentality.

2450
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:24.490
I'm not even about rescuing the victim,
just getting vindication,
getting revenge,

2451
02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:24.851
right?

2452
02:26:24.851 --> 02:26:29.710
Like I'm going to get paid for being a victim and that perpetrator's going to go

2453
02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:34.780
off somewhere and not get rehabilitated and people don't typically get better in

2454
02:26:34.781 --> 02:26:35.614
prison.

2455
02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.800
And when you look at like the whole downstream effect of that victim hood,

2456
02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:44.050
this was really good article by getting the Simon tons,

2457
02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:48.870
there were men and wife couple in the 80s they had some of the first early mind

2458
02:26:48.871 --> 02:26:52.540
body studies that showed the importance of what you think,

2459
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:54.280
how it affects your body.
They were,

2460
02:26:54.281 --> 02:26:58.390
he was an oncologist and she was a research psychologist and there were four

2461
02:26:58.391 --> 02:27:02.080
things that that no matter what level of cancer,

2462
02:27:02.410 --> 02:27:05.050
like stage or what type of cancer,

2463
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:09.130
there were consistent measures that showed people getting better and people

2464
02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:09.820
getting worse.

2465
02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:13.600
And one of those the consistently show people getting worse was victim hood.

2466
02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:17.980
Like they didn't believe that they had any empowerment to change their
situation.

2467
02:27:18.370 --> 02:27:20.530
Also inability to give and receive love,

2468
02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:23.560
resentment and low self esteem or self worth.

2469
02:27:23.561 --> 02:27:27.430
When you had all four of those you were like,
fuck,
that's so crazy thing.

2470
02:27:27.431 --> 02:27:29.590
The connection between the immune system.

2471
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:33.240
Right and your perceptions of the environment,
right?

2472
02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:36.520
Your perceptions of the world that you live in.
Right.
And you should just shoot.

2473
02:27:36.521 --> 02:27:41.260
We just showed,
you just showed me this morning,
um,
some article and wellbeing.

2474
02:27:41.261 --> 02:27:44.760
I think it was um,
the perception,
uh,

2475
02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:49.770
they did this really interesting study of housekeepers and housekeepers that

2476
02:27:50.681 --> 02:27:55.210
proceed that we're told that the activities that they were engaging with just

2477
02:27:55.211 --> 02:27:59.710
cleaning the hotel rooms.
And so they were told whatever they were doing,

2478
02:27:59.711 --> 02:28:01.720
cleaning,
fixing things that,

2479
02:28:01.721 --> 02:28:04.030
that at the dot they were told that that was healthy.

2480
02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:07.780
There was a group that was told that that was good exercise and another group

2481
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:08.770
that wasn't told anything.

2482
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:14.370
And after a period of weeks they did biologic physiologic markers and showed

2483
02:28:15.251 --> 02:28:20.230
that the,
the,
the,
the women that had the idea that they were exercising more,

2484
02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:25.250
had a less um,
uh,
weight gain.
I should,

2485
02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:28.730
their weight started to redistribute,
they had better blood pressure.

2486
02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:33.650
And heart rate measures,
their whole physiology shifted because of their belief,

2487
02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:37.670
not because they changed their activities at all.
So when you,

2488
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:39.710
when you look at the other side of that equation,

2489
02:28:39.711 --> 02:28:44.420
you had certain things that because of the way you thought made the illness

2490
02:28:44.421 --> 02:28:46.790
continue to seed that cancer profile,

2491
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:52.100
the two things that consistently help people get better was their faith,

2492
02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:56.870
their belief in a reason that this was happening or some,

2493
02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:00.560
some level of empowerment that they,
that they could utilize this,

2494
02:29:00.890 --> 02:29:05.890
this experience for benefit like the housekeepers and visualization that you

2495
02:29:06.711 --> 02:29:09.530
could actually visualize yourself becoming better.

2496
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:12.950
And they've also shown that with kids and kids are extraordinarily good

2497
02:29:12.951 --> 02:29:16.010
visualizers when you can,
you know,
kids that are,

2498
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:19.610
maybe it's an oncology department and like one of the pediatric hospitals,

2499
02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:24.890
when you can help them visualize their immune system actually working against

2500
02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:29.900
the cancer or overcoming something or you can project yourself into the future,

2501
02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.960
healed happy well and you engage with that and you feel into that and you

2502
02:29:35.061 --> 02:29:39.650
project that into the future.
That perspective shifts the physiology,

2503
02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:45.040
the psycho neuro immunological triad shifts towards healing just because of the

2504
02:29:45.501 --> 02:29:46.334
power of the mind.

2505
02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:51.280
<v 0>That is wild.
There's a placebo effect involved in being a housekeeper.
Totally.</v>

2506
02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:51.990
Yup.

2507
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:53.700
<v 3>Well it wasn't just about being a housekeeper,</v>

2508
02:29:53.701 --> 02:29:57.600
it was about being athletically engaged in what they were doing.

2509
02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:01.250
<v 0>Yeah,
they said that they told one group of housekeepers that the,</v>

2510
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:02.950
the exercise they were doing,

2511
02:30:02.951 --> 02:30:07.270
Mitt met the surgeon general's quota for a healthy exercise for an individual.

2512
02:30:07.271 --> 02:30:10.810
They use big terms like that method shirt and generals quota and then they told

2513
02:30:10.811 --> 02:30:12.160
the other people nothing.

2514
02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:15.220
And then they watch the difference in the groups between,

2515
02:30:15.221 --> 02:30:18.730
and they were all cleaning hotel rooms in the same as randomized and the people

2516
02:30:18.731 --> 02:30:22.120
who felt that they were meeting the surgeon general's requirement for exercise

2517
02:30:22.510 --> 02:30:26.410
had all of these dramatic improvements in weight loss and all these

2518
02:30:26.411 --> 02:30:31.000
physiological markers.
Wow.
I mean it crazy,
crazy.

2519
02:30:31.001 --> 02:30:36.001
That's just human beings and our minds are so fucking strange and the power of

2520
02:30:37.631 --> 02:30:39.600
the mind is so and then send,

2521
02:30:39.610 --> 02:30:43.390
it feels like this has only been really discovered over the last hundred years,

2522
02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.840
like even remotely and more so now than ever before.

2523
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:49.570
It's like an onion that's continually peeled and like,
no,

2524
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:51.280
I don't think there's a lot of layers here.

2525
02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:56.320
Let's keep going and peeling back layer and layer and layer and we're slowly

2526
02:30:56.321 --> 02:31:00.610
starting to unveil the power and the properties and and subsequently a

2527
02:31:00.611 --> 02:31:05.611
management system for this incredible engine that we have to construct our

2528
02:31:06.131 --> 02:31:09.130
environment.
Yet Joe Dispenza just wrote a book,

2529
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:13.950
you're the placebo and he's got all,
he's got the great scientific backwards.

2530
02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:17.950
It's called,
you are the Placebo Joe Dispenza.
Yeah.

2531
02:31:17.951 --> 02:31:20.250
He has a ton of articles

2532
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:20.821
<v 5>and then that was,</v>

2533
02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:25.821
I think I was talking about on the last name D I s p e n z a and he was the one

2534
02:31:26.791 --> 02:31:30.420
who sites all of these examples of these placebo surgeries,

2535
02:31:30.421 --> 02:31:34.050
these sham surgeries like arthroscopic knee surgeries that they did where they

2536
02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:38.250
did a placebo knee surgery and a real knee surgery and found that the outcomes

2537
02:31:38.251 --> 02:31:42.000
were identical and in some cases the people with the placebo knee surgery where

2538
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:44.610
they basically cut the skin and sewed it back up,

2539
02:31:45.090 --> 02:31:48.600
they had better outcomes than the people who had actual knee surgery.

2540
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:51.300
Like things that you think should not have a placebo effect.

2541
02:31:51.301 --> 02:31:54.750
Like if you're going to have knee surgery is probably pretty important that

2542
02:31:54.751 --> 02:31:57.930
you're going to do that.
No,
you can actually cut the skin,
tell somebody,
Yup,

2543
02:31:57.990 --> 02:32:02.700
surgery went great and they'll recover better than the people who actually got

2544
02:32:02.701 --> 02:32:03.810
the surgery.
In some cases

2545
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:07.460
<v 4>it wasn't that dude in that video.
What the bleep do we know?
Totally,</v>

2546
02:32:07.570 --> 02:32:08.403
unfortunately.

2547
02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:12.260
<v 3>And back then,
you know,</v>

2548
02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:16.390
that was kind of like the leading edge to have this whole mind body experience

2549
02:32:16.391 --> 02:32:17.260
and it was,
you know,

2550
02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:21.700
showed with kind of the meeting of science and metaphysics and

2551
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:25.190
<v 4>up until that ramp,
the lady came on and then you're like,
wait a minute,</v>

2552
02:32:25.191 --> 02:32:28.250
what's your name?
Hold on.
What's going on?
Here you are,

2553
02:32:28.251 --> 02:32:29.990
you're a thousand years old.
Okay.

2554
02:32:30.270 --> 02:32:34.730
In a thousand year old spirit that is embodied in this woman and you're talking

2555
02:32:34.731 --> 02:32:37.450
nonsense.
Everybody else seems to be talking science and you,

2556
02:32:37.451 --> 02:32:40.280
you organize this bitch,
you organize this whole thing.
Okay,

2557
02:32:40.930 --> 02:32:45.370
what right wasn't that was what the bleep do we know that?

2558
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:48.500
What the bleep do we know was so god damn confusing because there were some

2559
02:32:48.501 --> 02:32:51.310
really interesting stuff and there's some really sound science and that.
Yeah.

2560
02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:56.320
And there was also some fucking full laming are rocketing horseshit projectile

2561
02:32:57.670 --> 02:33:02.540
who are shit right.
It's like you couldn't get away.
Oh,
get out of here.

2562
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:06.140
That's kind of the nature of our world now,
right?

2563
02:33:06.141 --> 02:33:10.550
Like the skill of everything is not being able to throw away all apples with

2564
02:33:10.551 --> 02:33:10.910
worms.

2565
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:15.470
And I'm still of our world is to be able to cut out worms effectively and then

2566
02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:16.610
eat the fucking apple.

2567
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:21.910
Also recognize it in human beings that you maybe like some aspects of them.

2568
02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:22.760
Right.

2569
02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:26.510
I was having this conversation with a friend of mine about this guy that we know

2570
02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:30.950
that is clearly in some ways a weasel and he's just,

2571
02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:35.540
he's weasely and he,
he's super ambitious and you can't trust him and he's not,

2572
02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:37.340
he's just not cool.

2573
02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:41.090
And he had a bunch of like really bad interactions with other people that I know

2574
02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:44.660
that came to me independently and said,
look,
this guy's a fucking fraud.

2575
02:33:44.661 --> 02:33:45.494
It's guy's a piece of shit.

2576
02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:50.680
But I know him to be also a very good dispenser of interesting information when

2577
02:33:52.371 --> 02:33:53.930
I communicate with him.
Like he,

2578
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:57.560
he is really good at dispensing this information.

2579
02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:01.950
He gathers it,
he's like,
he's dedicated to it and he,

2580
02:34:01.970 --> 02:34:06.100
there's a lot of positive qualities,
qualities in that and he actually enjoys it.

2581
02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:10.280
He enjoys expressing himself in this way,
but then the,
all the other stuff,

2582
02:34:10.281 --> 02:34:12.980
it makes it so hard.
So some people just write them off and I'm like,

2583
02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:16.070
I can't ride them off.
I can't write them off.
Totally.
But unfortunately,

2584
02:34:16.071 --> 02:34:18.400
he's an exercise is an exercise

2585
02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:19.840
<v 6>in recognizing like what,</v>

2586
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:24.100
how much of these qualities are positive and how much of what he is is just

2587
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:25.390
douche.

2588
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:29.560
I think I've seen that when I've dealt with different shamans and spiritual

2589
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:30.430
teachers,
you know,

2590
02:34:30.431 --> 02:34:34.570
where people tend to want to put them on a pedestal as this being,

2591
02:34:34.571 --> 02:34:35.950
that's this perfect being,

2592
02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:40.420
and then as soon as they see something a little flawed,
they're like,
oh my God,

2593
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:45.070
my my holy savior is,
is not the holy savior.
I think he's like,
no,

2594
02:34:45.071 --> 02:34:47.200
he's just not perfect.
Like everybody else.

2595
02:34:47.201 --> 02:34:51.160
He's still really good at this and this and just accept him for that and watch

2596
02:34:51.161 --> 02:34:54.640
out for this little,
this little shitty part that he's still working on.

2597
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:59.110
Like it's okay.
He's still trying to get laid.
Yeah,
exactly.
Like people,
you know,

2598
02:34:59.111 --> 02:35:03.550
especially in that arena,
they demand this,
this level that's just not realistic.

2599
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:07.510
You know?
Like they did demand this intense perfection.
You know,
that was a,

2600
02:35:07.511 --> 02:35:11.560
one of the things that people will bring up.
The detractors of turns Mckenna,

2601
02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:15.880
they always bring up the fact that he had some holes in his science and there

2602
02:35:15.881 --> 02:35:19.970
were some,
some of this stuff was bullshit.
Maybe,
maybe,
but you,

2603
02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:25.200
you can't listen to his hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of available hours of

2604
02:35:25.211 --> 02:35:27.220
lectures that he had and not be inspired.

2605
02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:32.520
If you have any psychedelic curiosity and you listened to this unbelievably free

2606
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:33.430
thinker,

2607
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:37.090
this guy who's just like really willing to put himself out there and some sort

2608
02:35:37.091 --> 02:35:39.460
of,
uh,
and you know,
maybe miss the mark occasionally,

2609
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:42.370
but he's shooting a lot of fucking arrows.
Yeah.
You know,

2610
02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.410
there's even more extreme examples.

2611
02:35:44.411 --> 02:35:48.790
Like I've just recently found out what a crazy fuck Carlos Castaneda was.

2612
02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:51.880
He was insane.
He was like yelling at people.

2613
02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.650
He may have even convinced these women who he was dating to at least disappear

2614
02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:59.350
when he died.
I don't know.
They might've committed suicide.
Who even knows?

2615
02:35:59.351 --> 02:36:02.440
There's a lot of speculation because all the women he was dating disappeared

2616
02:36:02.441 --> 02:36:06.910
when he died.
So he was possibly even a bad person,
like straight up.

2617
02:36:06.911 --> 02:36:10.980
Not a good person,
but nonetheless,
you know,
I'll put a quote from cass,

2618
02:36:10.981 --> 02:36:15.370
Anita out and you know,
people will just all what he was a crazy fuck.
It's like,

2619
02:36:15.371 --> 02:36:18.700
yeah,
but this thing makes sense.
This little pit of philosophy,

2620
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:20.920
it still makes sense and it's still valuable.

2621
02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:23.350
Even if he was a crazy fucking person,

2622
02:36:23.351 --> 02:36:26.890
like be able to cut out the worm and say admit like,
yeah,

2623
02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:28.810
that dude was not a fucking good dude,

2624
02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:34.260
but he had some ideas that can be valuable when taken and applied and you,

2625
02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:35.110
you get to that,

2626
02:36:35.290 --> 02:36:39.730
you'll level up way faster because you'll get to keep more gems then than other

2627
02:36:39.731 --> 02:36:43.720
people who are just discarding everything.
It's like the jeep Cuando of life.

2628
02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:47.260
Yeah.
Absorb what is useful.
Exactly.
Exactly.

2629
02:36:47.290 --> 02:36:52.030
Personally had it nailed the perfect.
Yeah.
Perfect.
And do your shadow work.

2630
02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:54.060
Yeah.
Shadow work.
Yeah.

2631
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:57.490
Which is oftentimes what happens in the psychedelic experience or even
flotation.

2632
02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:02.050
What do you mean by shadow work?
Like,
like recognize within yourself ourselves.

2633
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:03.670
What's behind the curtain?

2634
02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:08.560
Like being able to see those aspects of myself that I haven't fully integrated,

2635
02:37:08.561 --> 02:37:13.561
fully accepted because it's only my projection and judgment of somebody else.

2636
02:37:13.971 --> 02:37:16.220
There's only a reflection of the shadow

2637
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:20.360
<v 0>material that I haven't integrated myself.
And usually it's those things that I,</v>

2638
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:24.830
I project onto others that I'm so emotionally connected to are people that

2639
02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:28.190
really pissed me off in a particular way that's related to the,

2640
02:37:28.210 --> 02:37:31.460
my own shadow work in that,
in that other side of the coin,
right.

2641
02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:32.690
That I haven't looked at yet.

2642
02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:36.530
The person saying there's no such thing as a sex drive.
Yeah.

2643
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:39.350
Look at her shadow work.
What's their,
what's buying or his,

2644
02:37:39.351 --> 02:37:41.660
I don't remember it as a man or a woman,
but either way,

2645
02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:46.020
no one's fucking are right.
No one wants to,
you know,

2646
02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:49.670
I'll tell you who doesn't talk about that Jennifer Lopez,

2647
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:54.800
that bitch knows is the sex drive.
She's built an empire off of it.
Right.

2648
02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:59.580
Um,
let's,
let's end this pitch.
This is a lot of fun to it.
Thank you.
Thank you.

2649
02:37:59.581 --> 02:38:01.310
You got a lot of fun.

but we'll all follow us on the social channels.

2658
02:38:34.311 --> 02:38:38.870
Will point the finger at the moon.
Yeah.
Cool Shit.
Yeah.
Remember to,

2659
02:38:38.871 --> 02:38:42.440
don't concentrate only on the finger.
Cause then you will miss,

2660
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:44.270
I forget the quote Bruce Lee.

2661
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:48.530
All the heavenly growing that lies beyond Dan and go thank you very much sir.
