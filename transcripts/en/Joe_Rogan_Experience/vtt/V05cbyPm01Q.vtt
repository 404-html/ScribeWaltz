00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:03.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:04.381
<v Speaker 1>it's just wild.</v>

4
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:04.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>in Vietnam it's like,</v>

6
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.611
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like,</v>

7
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam is so beautiful,</v>

8
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>you're going to love it.</v>

9
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.664
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

10
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

11
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely beautiful.</v>

12
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>But I see poverty and air that God,</v>

13
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.941
<v Speaker 1>no one can breathe.</v>

14
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's wearing masks because they can't inhale.</v>

15
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>There's no emissions regulations.</v>

16
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's on like,</v>

17
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.143
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

18
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>oh right white trust fund kids are like Vietnam sputum.</v>

19
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.141
<v Speaker 1>And they say that,</v>

20
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>cause they can come back to,</v>

21
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.201
<v Speaker 1>Williamsburg,</v>

23
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn or whatever.</v>

24
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.023
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

25
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>People love talking about Brown people being amazing.</v>

26
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

28
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

29
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not a better person because you think Vietnam is amazing.</v>

30
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Like just admit that it's,</v>

31
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>we need to,</v>

32
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I know we fucked it up a lot of,</v>

34
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>it's our fault of what we did in the 70s,</v>

35
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.394
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

36
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.031
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

37
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:48.864
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>gave me a lot of anxiety.</v>

39
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.121
<v Speaker 1>cause it was like,</v>

41
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just like the hospitals.</v>

42
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>we were in a hospital and you know,</v>

44
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>we needed four of this machine that puts babies to sleep.</v>

45
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Pediatric anesthesia is very different than regular anesthesia.</v>

46
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's essentially bringing people to the brink of death and then bringing</v>

47
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:06.631
<v Speaker 1>them back.</v>

48
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like incredibly fascinating,</v>

49
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

52
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>And they had one of the machines that they need it and knew the pediatric</v>

53
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.081
<v Speaker 1>anesthesiologists.</v>

54
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

55
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:16.741
<v Speaker 1>we need four.</v>

56
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.071
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

57
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.904
<v Speaker 1>we don't have,</v>

58
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>we just don't have them in this country.</v>

59
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>We just can't do surgery on babies.</v>

60
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just not in our purview.</v>

61
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

62
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.101
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

63
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:27.934
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

64
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:28.741
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

66
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>so back to,</v>

67
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

68
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>the kids come in with cleft palates and cleft lips,</v>

70
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>which the baby is essentially,</v>

71
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they have trouble breastfeeding.</v>

72
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.833
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

73
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and cleft palates just,</v>

74
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:39.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>just kind of this opening here and a separation malnutrition.</v>

76
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.613
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

78
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Exposure to genetics,</v>

79
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>exposure to pollution.</v>

81
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure all that napalm we dropped in the 70s didn't really help.</v>

82
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

83
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.591
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

84
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>and in America it still happens,</v>

85
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's handled right away.</v>

86
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's handled,</v>

87
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>it comes out three months later.</v>

88
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.374
<v Speaker 1>It's fixed.</v>

89
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>No big deal over there.</v>

90
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's never fixed.</v>

91
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:04.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:04.831
<v Speaker 1>you see adults,</v>

93
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you see men that are 50 come in with giant,</v>

94
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>giant cleft lips and palates and they've,</v>

95
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's even worse in third world countries,</v>

96
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>especially African countries because there's such a stigma attached to it.</v>

97
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it,</v>

98
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>in our brains to go like he's different than me and ostracized or stigmatized</v>

100
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.051
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

101
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:22.231
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

102
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.064
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of more religious countries think you're the devil or your,</v>

104
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a job.</v>

106
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>You're completely sequester and you're thrown out of your family.</v>

107
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

108
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.471
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

109
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>and this is gonna sound Super Corny,</v>

110
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but I guess for me,</v>

112
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

113
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I connected so much to maybe it's cause you know,</v>

114
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>we're comedians.</v>

115
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.493
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

116
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.723
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

117
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

118
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to Grub in with their world country,</v>

119
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>it's another thing to deal with poverty and,</v>

120
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't smile,</v>

121
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>like the basic,</v>

122
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>the only real medicine we have,</v>

123
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>everybody has,</v>

125
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and universal medicine of like laughing and it's how we connect to people.</v>

126
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

127
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked.</v>

129
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Like that was frustrating and a,</v>

130
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to fix.</v>

131
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's like frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes.</v>

132
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Look at Joaquin Phoenix.</v>

133
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Look at Joaquin Phoenix.</v>

134
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to live having anxiety issues.</v>

135
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.341
<v Speaker 1>Like why do I have that?</v>

136
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

137
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

138
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.901
<v Speaker 1>What am I afraid of?</v>

139
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

140
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

141
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

142
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

143
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid enough to where I'm not going to do it,</v>

144
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>so let's just not make it a big,</v>

145
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>not make it something I don't like.</v>

146
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I do like it.</v>

147
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm doing track.</v>

148
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I like him and maybe that's some of doing it.</v>

149
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make it something I hate.</v>

150
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make it something.</v>

151
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy it because it's not rational.</v>

152
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not why I do this.</v>

153
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I do this because I love it,</v>

154
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>so let's not make it something I,</v>

155
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I hate ever.</v>

156
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.873
<v Speaker 1>I try not to.</v>

157
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a very rational approach though.</v>

158
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very unusual for people.</v>

159
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing in this life.</v>

161
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Like if I want to do it,</v>

162
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>that fears going to stop me.</v>

163
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Fears are realistic thing.</v>

164
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.391
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

165
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:49.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It's scary to get into the cage.</v>

167
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>It's scary to think about losing w you know,</v>

168
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and I've tasted the most bitter losses you could ever dream of and it's</v>

169
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

170
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's crushing.</v>

171
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the most scary thing.</v>

172
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not getting beat up.</v>

173
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not breaking your nose or breaking my orbital bone or letting my arm gets</v>

174
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>snapped in half.</v>

175
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not the scary part about fighting and what I do.</v>

176
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>The scary part is not being adequate enough,</v>

177
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>not being good enough that you're 100% wasn't good enough.</v>

178
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

179
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That's really scary.</v>

180
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

181
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.211
<v Speaker 1>I've had that,</v>

182
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I've had to face that point blank right in the face many times before.</v>

183
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's the hardest thing to do.</v>

184
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Bar none.</v>

185
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the hardest thing to look at yourself and be like,</v>

186
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.323
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

187
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't enough.</v>

188
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't enough.</v>

189
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.830
<v Speaker 1>No one else can be responsible for that.</v>

190
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

191
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>

192
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.173
<v Speaker 1>I have to own this.</v>

193
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And to come back from something like that and think that you can still,</v>

194
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you can still get it back or you can still do it again or you could still get</v>

195
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.101
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

196
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You can learn from that.</v>

197
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

198
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>that's also the challenging part of it,</v>

199
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that I've,</v>

201
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I've had to,</v>

202
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>to get to this point,</v>

203
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I've had to get over those situations where I thought that my world had ended.</v>

204
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

205
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>my second loss to Rhonda was the most devastating.</v>

206
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The first loss was devastating.</v>

207
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>The second loss was ah,</v>

208
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>like it was horrible.</v>

209
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I thought my world was,</v>

210
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>was coming to an end and you know,</v>

211
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>nobody cared about my family and friends,</v>

212
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of world,</v>

213
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>

214
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

215
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about second place.</v>

216
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't care,</v>

217
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

218
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

219
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 1>they're mean.</v>

220
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>People are harsh.</v>

221
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>They're mean on social media you have to get thick skin quick and nobody teaches</v>

222
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you how to deal with that either.</v>

223
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no MMA,</v>

224
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>social media one on one or like you don't,</v>

225
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>you just sink or swim.</v>

226
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>You figure it out or you don't either bothers you or it doesn't,</v>

227
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>either you yell back at everyone or you don't.</v>

229
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of getting there,</v>

230
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I tried to watch soccer last night.</v>

231
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.841
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

232
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 2>and I was going to bring that up.</v>

233
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>People tweeted me that you're watching soccer to a game on Sunday at the</v>

234
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.080
<v Speaker 2>mother's Day.</v>

235
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Mother's Day.</v>

236
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.781
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

237
00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>shit happened.</v>

238
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

239
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.713
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

240
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

241
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.041
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

242
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

243
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

244
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.950
<v Speaker 2>it was at the store and uh,</v>

245
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 2>we were hanging out in the secret comedians bar</v>

246
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 2>and soccer was on,</v>

247
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>so we just started watching it.</v>

248
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Just started watching that show.</v>

249
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Who had that on?</v>

250
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Ryan White was watching it.</v>

251
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:02.804
<v Speaker 2>I was watching it.</v>

252
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Some of the employees were watching it,</v>

253
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

255
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 2>who else was in there with us?</v>

256
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Tony was watching at one point,</v>

257
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.890
<v Speaker 2>but I started getting upset if these dudes getting slapped and going down like</v>

258
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that get hit with a meteor.</v>

259
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like that.</v>

260
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

261
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I just can't support this kind of nonsense.</v>

262
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>You were watching a really good game.</v>

263
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 2>You're really watching a really good game.</v>

265
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

266
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.731
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

267
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Like skill wise by Munich and the red,</v>

268
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 2>they're the best German team and this is a champion's league game,</v>

269
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know how to explain it.</v>

270
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Champions League is square,</v>

271
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>the four best teams in each league in each country.</v>

272
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Like playing a tournament to,</v>

273
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 2>to be the best club team in Europe.</v>

274
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 2>So Byron is,</v>

275
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>is like the number one team in Germany.</v>

276
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Athletical they like number two,</v>

277
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 2>number three right now.</v>

278
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>That actually in number,</v>

279
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>the number two spot right now.</v>

280
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 2>But last year they finished maybe second or third at the end there,</v>

281
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.770
<v Speaker 2>they have less money but their coaches are ex Argentina player and he figured</v>

282
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 2>out a system where they just hustle,</v>

283
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 2>they just out hustle you,</v>

284
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 2>you get the ball and there's three motherfuckers on you and you're going to</v>

285
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>cough it up and they're going to get it.</v>

286
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And they will score a one or two goals a game and that's enough.</v>

287
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But you know and buying is just so really skilled that they might be able to,</v>

288
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 2>they beat most teams but athletics is just so disciplined that you know,</v>

289
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they knocked them out and,</v>

290
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

291
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>they're going to the Champions League final versus Real Madrid.</v>

292
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's two Spanish teams in the champion's league final and both of them are</v>

293
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>from the same city.</v>

294
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the Lakers versus the clippers for like the best.</v>

302
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.051

304
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.361
<v Speaker 2>Let me know.</v>

305
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It's very exciting.</v>

306
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

307
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.821
<v Speaker 2>It's funny though.</v>

308
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're going to do.</v>

309
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to come?</v>

310
00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you're going to talk shit.</v>

311
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>You're going to transcode.</v>

312
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

313
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why you people,</v>

314
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you right now,</v>

315
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you go start falling down when people slap you.</v>

316
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

317
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes that.</v>

318
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

319
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.411
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes.</v>

320
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't do it.</v>

321
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.181
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do it.</v>

322
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 2>It's an MBA now too.</v>

323
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 2>He's in the NBA now.</v>

324
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear this shitty like I,</v>

325
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never liked it.</v>

326
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 2>But people do it to get the free kick or the penalty or to get the other person</v>

327
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 2>sent off.</v>

328
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>It's become a part of the game.</v>

329
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:24.734
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunate.</v>

330
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>So let's just get that out the way before you come because that's,</v>

331
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see that.</v>

332
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>But besides that,</v>

333
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.361
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

334
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:30.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

335
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a man's game.</v>

336
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

337
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

338
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

339
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 2>When Raquel Pennington choked out,</v>

340
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.141
<v Speaker 2>Ashley,</v>

341
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Evan Smith Blood was pouring down her face and she strangled or unconscious with</v>

342
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>one second to go with a bulldog choke in the first round.</v>

343
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a girl,</v>

344
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 2>135 pound girl,</v>

345
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and you get smacked of running down the field.</v>

346
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

347
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

348
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.900
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>

349
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Fall.</v>

350
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 2>They hold their mouth.</v>

351
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 2>They roll around like a baby.</v>

352
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:53.751
<v Speaker 2>And women.</v>

354
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And when you watch women's soccer,</v>

355
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>women don't do that.</v>

356
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Women don't do that.</v>

357
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Women do not take dies and get smashed.</v>

358
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to start a campaign.</v>

359
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can help him.</v>

360
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
